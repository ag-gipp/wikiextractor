Hurricane Andrew

Hurricane Andrew was a destructive <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20scale%23Category%205">Category 5</a> <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane">Atlantic hurricane</a> that struck the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, and <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> in mid-to-late August 1992. It was the most destructive hurricane to ever hit Florida until <a href="Hurricane%20Irma">Hurricane Irma</a> surpassed it <a href="2017%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">25 years later</a>. It was the strongest in decades and the <a href="List%20of%20costliest%20Atlantic%20hurricanes">costliest hurricane</a> to make <a href="landfall">landfall</a> anywhere in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> until it was surpassed by <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Katrina</a> in 2005. Andrew caused major damage in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> and <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, but the greatest impact was felt in <a href="South%20Florida">South Florida</a>, where the storm made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of <a href="Homestead%2C%20Florida">Homestead</a> in <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade County</a> (now known as Miami-Dade County), Andrew stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. In total, Andrew destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $27.4 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead. 

Andrew began as a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapidly intensified</a> into a powerful Category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 status while traversing the Bahamas, it regained Category 5 intensity before making landfall in Florida on <a href="Elliott%20Key">Elliott Key</a> and then <a href="Homestead%2C%20Florida">Homestead</a> on August 24. With a barometric pressure of 922 <a href="bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (27.23 <a href="inches%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>) at the time of landfall in Florida, Andrew is the sixth most-intense hurricane to strike the United States. Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> at Category 4 strength, with the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf Coast of the United States</a> in its dangerous path. After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near <a href="Morgan%20City%2C%20Louisiana">Morgan City, Louisiana</a>, as a low-end Category 3 storm. After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a <a href="weather%20front">frontal system</a> over the southern <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> on August 28.

Hurricane Andrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the Bahamas, especially in <a href="Cat%20Cays">Cat Cays</a>, lashing the islands with <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>, <a href="hurricane-force%20winds">hurricane-force winds</a>, and <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es. About 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago, and there was substantial damage to the transport, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing sectors. Andrew left four dead and $250 million in damage throughout the Bahamas. In parts of southern Florida, Andrew produced severe winds; a wind gust of 177 mph (282 km/h) was observed at a house in <a href="Perrine%2C%20Florida">Perrine</a>. The cities of <a href="Florida%20City%2C%20Florida">Florida City</a>, Homestead, and <a href="Cutler%20Ridge%2C%20Florida">Cutler Ridge</a> received the brunt of the storm. As many as 1.4 million people lost power at the height of the storm. In the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a>, 70,000 acres (280 km) of trees were downed, while invasive <a href="Burmese%20python">Burmese python</a>s began <a href="Burmese%20pythons%20in%20Florida">inhabiting the region</a> after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed. Rainfall in Florida was substantial, peaking at 13.98 inches (355 mm) in western Dade County. In Florida, Andrew killed 44 and left a record $25 billion in damage.

Prior to making landfall in Louisiana on August 26, Andrew caused extensive damage to <a href="Offshore%20oil%20and%20gas%20in%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico%20%28United%20States%29">oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico</a>, leading to $500 million in losses for oil companies. It produced hurricane-force winds along its path through Louisiana, damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230,000 people without electricity. Over 80% of trees in the <a href="Atchafalaya%20River">Atchafalaya River</a> basin were downed, and the agriculture there was devastated. Throughout the basin and <a href="Bayou%20Lafourche">Bayou Lafourche</a>, 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane. With 23,000 houses damaged, 985 others destroyed, and 1,951 mobile homes demolished, property losses in Louisiana exceeded $1.5 billion. The hurricane caused the deaths of 17 people in the state, 6 of whom drowned offshore. Andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the Gulf Coast, especially in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. In total, Andrew left 65 dead and caused $27.3 billion in damage. It is currently the seventh-costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States, behind only <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Katrina</a> (2005), <a href="Hurricane%20Ike">Ike</a> (2008), <a href="Hurricane%20Sandy">Sandy</a> (2012), <a href="Hurricane%20Harvey">Harvey</a> (2017), <a href="Hurricane%20Irma">Irma</a> (2017), and <a href="Hurricane%20Maria">Maria</a> (2017), as well as the eighth-costliest Atlantic hurricane, behind the aforementioned systems and <a href="Hurricane%20Wilma">Wilma</a> (2005). It is the third-strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland by wind speed (165 mph).

A <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> moved off the west coast of Africa on August 14. A <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> of high pressure to its north caused the wave to move quickly westward. An area of <a href="convection">convection</a> developed along the wave axis to the south of the <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> islands, and on August 15, <a href="meteorology">meteorologists</a> began classifying the system with the <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak technique</a>. The thunderstorm activity became more concentrated, and narrow spiral <a href="Rainband%23Tropical%20cyclones">rainbands</a> began to develop around a <a href="atmospheric%20circulation">center of circulation</a>. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Three developed late on August 16, about east-southeast of <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>. Embedded within the deep easterlies, the depression tracked west-northwestward at . Initially, moderate <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> prevented strengthening, until a decrease in shear allowed the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Andrew at 12:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on August 17.

By early August 18, the storm maintained convection near the center with spiral bands to its west as the winds increased to . Shortly thereafter, the storm began weakening because of increased southwesterly wind shear from an upper-level low. On August 19, a <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a> flight into the storm failed to locate a well-defined center and on the following day, a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated to the extent that only a diffuse low-level circulation center remained; observations indicated the <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> rose to an unusually high . The flight indicated that Andrew maintained a vigorous circulation aloft. After the <a href="cold-core%20low">upper-level low</a> weakened and split into a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a>, the wind shear decreased over the storm. A strong high pressure system then developed over the southeastern United States, which built eastward and caused Andrew to turn to the west. Convection became more organized as upper-level <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> became better established. An <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> formed, and Andrew attained hurricane status early on August 22, about east-southeast of <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau, Bahamas</a>. In the forecast issued six hours after becoming a hurricane, the cyclone was predicted to make <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Jupiter%2C%20Florida">Jupiter, Florida</a>, with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on August 25. This underestimated both the strength and the speed of the storm, which would eventually make landfall in South Florida.
The hurricane accelerated westward into an area of highly favorable conditions, and began to rapidly intensify late on August 22; in a 24‑hour period the atmospheric pressure dropped by to a minimum of . On August 23, the storm attained Category 5 status on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale</a>, reaching <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">peak winds</a> of 175 mph (280 km/h) a short distance off <a href="Eleuthera">Eleuthera</a> island in the Bahamas at 18:00 UTC. Despite its intensity, Andrew was a small tropical cyclone, with winds of extending out only about 90 mi (150 km) from the center. After reaching that intensity, the hurricane underwent an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29%23Eyewall%20replacement%20cycles">eyewall replacement cycle</a>. At 21:00 UTC on August 23, Andrew made landfall on Eleuthera as a Category 5 hurricane, with winds of . The cyclone weakened further while crossing the <a href="Bahama%20Banks">Bahama Banks</a>, and at 01:00 UTC on August 24, Andrew hit the southern <a href="Berry%20Islands">Berry Islands</a> of the Bahamas as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds of . As it crossed over the warm waters of the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, the hurricane rapidly re-intensified as the eye decreased in size and its eyewall convection deepened. At 08:40 UTC on August 24, Andrew struck <a href="Elliott%20Key">Elliott Key</a> with winds of and a pressure of . About 25 minutes after its first Florida landfall, Andrew hit just northeast of Homestead with a slightly lower pressure of . This barometric pressure made Andrew the most intense hurricane to strike the United States since <a href="Hurricane%20Camille">Hurricane Camille</a> in <a href="1969%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1969</a> and the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in Florida since the <a href="1935%20Labor%20Day%20hurricane">Labor Day hurricane</a> of <a href="1935%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1935</a>.
As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the convection in the eyewall strengthened due to increased convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the Gulf of Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf Coast of the United States</a>.

At 08:30 UTC on August 26, the cyclone made landfall about 20 mi (30 km) west-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, with winds of . Andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast, falling to tropical storm intensity within 10 hours. After entering Mississippi, the cyclone deteriorated to tropical depression status early on August 27. Accelerating northeastward, the depression began merging with the approaching frontal system, and by midday on August 28, Andrew merged with a <a href="weather%20front">frontal system</a> while located over the southern Appalachian Mountains. The remnants continued moving towards the northeast, and it lost its identity later that day, merging with the remnants of <a href="Hurricane%20Lester%20%281992%29">Hurricane Lester</a> and a frontal zone over the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic</a>.

Post-analysis on Andrew revealed that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on August 22 and early on August 26. In real time, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> assessed its peak intensity as , which was upgraded to 155 mph (250 km/h) in a post-storm analysis after the season ended. However, a 2004 paper by <a href="Christopher%20Landsea">Christopher Landsea</a> and others concluded that Andrew became a Category 5 hurricane near the Bahamas on August 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). The paper also indicated that Andrew briefly re-intensified into a Category 5 hurricane around the time of landfall in South Florida early on August 24. The storm was found to have been slightly stronger while approaching Louisiana, but the landfall winds were decreased from 120 mph (195 km/h) to 115 mph (185 km/h).

<a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Bahamas Prime Minister</a> <a href="Hubert%20Ingraham">Hubert Ingraham</a>, who took office while the storm was active, urged residents to "take this hurricane seriously". Before the hurricane passed through the Bahamas, forecasters predicted a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> of up to , as well as up to of rain. On August 22, <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">hurricane watches</a> were issued from <a href="Andros%2C%20Bahamas">Andros</a> and <a href="Eleuthera">Eleuthera</a> islands northward through <a href="Grand%20Bahama">Grand Bahama</a> and <a href="Andros%2C%20Bahamas">Great Abaco</a>. They were upgraded to hurricane warnings later that day, and on August 23, additional warnings were issued for the central Bahamas, including <a href="Cat%20Island%20%28Bahamas%29">Cat Island</a>, <a href="Exuma">Exuma</a>, <a href="San%20Salvador%20Island">San Salvador Island</a>, and <a href="Long%20Island%2C%20Bahamas">Long Island, Bahamas</a>. All watches and warnings were discontinued on August 24. Advance warning was credited for the low death toll in the country. A total of 58 shelters were opened at churches, government buildings, and schools.

Initially, forecasters predicted tides up to above normal along the east coast of Florida, near the potential location of landfall. Rainfall was projected to be between along the path of the storm. In addition, the National Hurricane Center noted the likelihood of isolated tornadoes in Central and South Florida during the passage of Andrew on August 23 and 24. Several tropical storm and hurricane warnings were issued for much of Central and South Florida, from <a href="Titusville%2C%20Florida">Titusville</a> on the east coast to <a href="Venice%2C%20Florida">Venice</a> on the west coast. Included in the warnings were <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a> and all of the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>. By 18:00 UTC on August 24, all watches and warnings issued were discontinued after Andrew progressed into the Gulf of Mexico.

<a href="Governor%20of%20Florida">Governor</a> <a href="Lawton%20Chiles">Lawton Chiles</a> declared a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> and activated about one-third of the <a href="Florida%20National%20Guard">Florida National Guard</a>. Many residents evacuated, most voluntarily, from <a href="Broward%20County%2C%20Florida">Broward</a>, <a href="Charlotte%20County%2C%20Florida">Charlotte</a>, <a href="Collier%20County%2C%20Florida">Collier</a>, <a href="Lee%20County%2C%20Florida">Lee</a>, <a href="Martin%20County%2C%20Florida">Martin</a>, <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade</a>, <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Florida">Monroe</a>, <a href="Palm%20Beach%20County%2C%20Florida">Palm Beach</a>, and <a href="Sarasota%20County%2C%20Florida">Sarasota</a> counties. A total of 142 shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84,340 people. In Dade County alone, 515,670 people were ordered to evacuate. As Andrew was approaching, an estimated 20,000–30,000 tourists were in the Florida Keys (Monroe County). Overall, almost 1.2 million people evacuated, which contributed to the low number of fatalities, despite the intensity of the storm. Many evacuees also checked into hotels, with rooms completely booked as far north as <a href="Ocala%2C%20Florida">Ocala</a>. Ultimately, the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of Florida, mostly along <a href="Interstate%2095%20in%20Florida">Interstate 95</a>. <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> vessels on or near the Florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea. Government offices and public and private schools were closed from Monroe County northward to <a href="St.%20Lucie%20County%2C%20Florida">St. Lucie County</a>. Many colleges and universities in southeast Florida also closed, including <a href="Barry%20University">Barry University</a>, <a href="Broward%20Community%20College">Broward Community College</a>, <a href="Florida%20Atlantic%20University">Florida Atlantic University</a>, <a href="Florida%20International%20University">Florida International University</a>, <a href="Nova%20Southeastern%20University">Nova Southeastern University</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Miami">University of Miami</a>. Major airports such as the <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%E2%80%93Hollywood%20International%20Airport">Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood</a>, <a href="Key%20West%20International%20Airport">Key West</a>, <a href="Miami%20International%20Airport">Miami</a>, and <a href="Palm%20Beach%20International%20Airport">Palm Beach</a> international airports closed.

Shortly after the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico from southern Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane watches and warnings for the Gulf Coast of the United States beginning at 13:00 UTC on August 24. After the initial hurricane watch from <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a> to <a href="Sabine%20Pass%2C%20Port%20Arthur%2C%20Texas">Sabine Pass, Texas</a>, the watches and warnings were expanded to eventually include areas from Mobile, Alabama, to <a href="Freeport%2C%20Texas">Freeport, Texas</a>. All watches and warnings on the Gulf Coast were discontinued late on August 26 after the hurricane moved inland over Louisiana.

Due to the hurricane's threat, workers fled oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, while the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">Coast Guard</a> moved their boats inland. Officials in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> suggested that about 100,000 people evacuate the <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Mississippi">coastal counties</a>. Shelters were opened in <a href="Hancock%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Hancock</a> and <a href="Harrison%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Harrison</a> counties, though only 68 people went to a shelter in the former. <a href="Riverboat%20casino">Gambling ships</a> were moved into harbors and inland canals. Two run-offs for special <a href="Mississippi%20Legislature">legislative</a> elections scheduled for August 25 were postponed.

In <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Governor%20of%20Louisiana">Governor</a> <a href="Edwin%20Edwards">Edwin Edwards</a> declared a state of emergency. About 1.25 million people evacuated from the central and southeast Louisiana, while approximately 60,000 others fled <a href="List%20of%20parishes%20in%20Louisiana">parishes</a> in southwest Louisiana. A mandatory evacuation from <a href="Grand%20Isle%2C%20Louisiana">Grand Isle</a> was ordered by Mayor Andy Valence and the city council. In <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, Mayor <a href="Sidney%20Barthelemy">Sidney Barthelemy</a> ordered the evacuation of about 200,000 residents in the low-lying areas of the city. Nine shelters were opened in the city, which were occupied by thousands of people. In response to computer simulations showing that storm surge from a tropical cyclone like Hurricane Andrew could over-top <a href="Drainage%20in%20New%20Orleans">the levees</a>, workers closed 111 <a href="floodgate">floodgate</a>s. The <a href="Louis%20Armstrong%20New%20Orleans%20International%20Airport">Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport</a> closed, with jumbo jets being flown to other airports. A total of 250 members of the <a href="Louisiana%20National%20Guard">Louisiana National Guard</a> patrolled the streets during the storm. The <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> assisted with opening a shelter at the <a href="University%20of%20Southwest%20Louisiana">University of Southwest Louisiana</a>'s <a href="Cajundome">Cajundome</a> in <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Louisiana">Lafayette</a>, equipped to handle about 2,000 people.

In <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, about 250,000 people evacuated <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20Texas">Orange</a> and <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Texas">Jefferson</a> counties. <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston</a> City Manager Doug Matthews advised residents to develop an evacuation plan in the event that the city chose to call for evacuations. The city later decided against ordering an evacuation. School was canceled on August 25 for <a href="Beaumont%2C%20Texas">Beaumont</a>, <a href="Port%20Arthur%2C%20Texas">Port Arthur</a>, and other areas of central Jefferson County, while schools were closed in <a href="Dickinson%2C%20Texas">Dickinson</a>, <a href="High%20Island%2C%20Texas">High Island</a>, <a href="Hitchcock%2C%20Texas">Hitchcock</a>, <a href="La%20Marque%2C%20Texas">La Marque</a>, <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20Texas">Santa Fe</a>, and <a href="Texas%20City%2C%20Texas">Texas City</a> on August 26. <a href="College%20of%20the%20Mainland">College of the Mainland</a>, <a href="Galveston%20College">Galveston College</a>, and <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%20at%20Galveston">Texas A&M University at Galveston</a> were also closed. Emergency management crews in <a href="Corpus%20Christi%2C%20Texas">Corpus Christi</a> began testing emergency generators and severe weather gear. The <a href="Comal%20County%2C%20Texas">Comal County</a> chapter of the Red Cross placed their disaster alert teams on standby and ready to respond if the hurricane threatened the <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20metropolitan%20area">Corpus Christi area</a>.

Though Andrew was a small tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan, it caused extreme damage, especially in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana. The vast majority of the damage was as a result of extremely high winds, although a few tornadoes spawned by Andrew caused considerable damage in Louisiana. Throughout the areas affected, almost 177,000 people were left homeless. Outside of the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, effects were widespread, although damage was minimal. Overall, $27.3 billion in losses and 65 fatalities were attributed to Andrew, with some estimates ranging as high as $34 billion. Andrew was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history at the time, but is now seventh following hurricanes <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Katrina</a> (2005), <a href="Hurricane%20Ike">Ike</a> (2008), <a href="Hurricane%20Sandy">Sandy</a> (2012), <a href="Hurricane%20Harvey">Harvey</a> (2017), <a href="Hurricane%20Irma">Irma</a> (2017), and <a href="Hurricane%20Maria">Maria</a> (2017).

In the Bahamas, Andrew produced hurricane-force winds in <a href="North%20Eleuthera">North Eleuthera</a>, <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a>, <a href="North%20Andros">North Andros</a>, <a href="Bimini">Bimini</a>, and the Berry Islands. The storm first struck North Eleuthera, where it produced a high storm surge. At a small village in the northwestern portion of the island, more than half of the houses were destroyed and the rest of the buildings sustained minor to major damage. One person drowned from the surge in Lower Bogue, Eleuthera, and two others died in <a href="The%20Bluff%2C%20Bahamas">The Bluff</a>. On Current Island, the hurricane destroyed 24 of the 30 houses. <a href="Harbour%20Island%2C%20Bahamas">Harbour Island</a>, near Eleuthera, reported wind gusts of – the strongest gust speed observed in the Bahamas during Andrew's passage. News reports indicated severe damage to 36 houses on Harbor Island.

Andrew produced several tornadoes in the area. At the capital city of <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>, sustained winds reached , while gusts up to were reported. Only minor damage occurred in Nassau, according to the Bahamas Red Cross, but on the private island of Cat Cay, many expensive homes sustained heavy damage. Much of the northwestern Bahamas received damage, with estimated monetary losses reaching $250 million. A total of 800 houses were destroyed, leaving 1,700 people homeless. Additionally, the storm caused severe damage to the sectors of transport, communications, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing. Four deaths in the country were attributed to the hurricane, of which three were direct; the indirect fatality was due to heart failure during the passage of the storm.

Overall, Andrew caused about $25.3 billion in damage in Florida, making it the costliest hurricane to hit the state at the time. Some estimates in Florida put the damage as high as $32 billion (1992 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>, $  USD). Almost all of the damage in Florida was caused by strong winds. Of the 44 deaths attributed to the storm, 15 were direct fatalities, while 29 were indirectly caused by the storm. It was later noted that if Andrew had been slightly larger or had made landfall a few miles further north, it would have significantly affected <a href="Miami">Miami</a> and <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%2C%20Florida">Fort Lauderdale</a>, which would have resulted in an even higher damage and death toll. An analysis by the <a href="American%20Meteorological%20Society">American Meteorological Society</a> indicated that unlike most hurricanes, wind damage from Andrew was mostly north of the geometric center and occurred primarily on the eastern edge of the storm. Some officials in Florida considered Andrew the worst storm in the state since the <a href="1935%20Labor%20Day%20hurricane">Labor Day hurricane in 1935</a>. The storm surge from Andrew caused more than $500 million in losses to boats and buildings. At the height of the storm, more than 1.4 million people lost electricity and another 150,000 were without telephone service. It is estimated that throughout Florida, the storm damaged 101,241 homes and destroyed approximately 63,000 others – the vast majority in Dade County – with about 175,000 people rendered homeless. In addition to homes, the storm damaged or destroyed 82,000 businesses, of farmland, 31 public schools, 59 health facilities/hospitals, 9,500 traffic signals, of power lines, and 3,000 watermains. Approximately 20 million cubic yards (15 million <a href="Cubic%20metre">m</a>) of debris left by the storm were disposed of.

Tides were generally between above normal in the Biscayne Bay area, though near the <a href="Burger%20King">Burger King International Headquarters</a>, tides reached as high as above normal. Storm surge on the west coast was widespread but generally light, with a peak height of in <a href="Everglades%20City%2C%20Florida">Everglades City</a> and <a href="Goodland%2C%20Florida">Goodland</a>. Strong winds from the storm were confined to a relatively small area, stretching from <a href="Key%20Largo">Key Largo</a> to the <a href="Miami%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Miami Beach</a> area. A house near <a href="Perrine%2C%20Florida">Perrine</a> initially reported a wind gust of before the structure and instrument were destroyed; this measurement was reduced to , after wind-tunnel testing at the <a href="Virginia%20Polytechnic%20Institute%20and%20State%20University">Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</a> of the same type of anemometer revealed a 16.5% error. Several other anemometers measuring the highest wind speeds on land were destroyed or failed. At the National Hurricane Center building in <a href="Coral%20Gables%2C%20Florida">Coral Gables</a>, sustained winds of and gusts to were measured before the anemometer failed. The highest sustained wind speed for the storm was , recorded at the <a href="Turkey%20Point%20Nuclear%20Generating%20Station">Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station</a>, before instruments also failed there. In Key Largo, a 13-minute wind speed of was reported. Tropical storm force winds reached as far north as <a href="West%20Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida">West Palm Beach</a>. On the west coast of Florida, sustained winds remained just below tropical storm force on <a href="Marco%20Island%2C%20Florida">Marco Island</a>, though a wind gust of was reported in Collier County. Rainfall was generally light, possibly as a result of the storm's relatively fast movement. Overall, precipitation from Andrew peaked at nearly in western Dade County. Heavy rainfall in other areas was sporadic, with precipitation reported as far north as <a href="Central%20Florida">Central Florida</a>.

Although effects from Andrew were catastrophic, the extent of damage was limited mainly from <a href="Kendall%2C%20Florida">Kendall</a> to Key Largo due to the small wind field of the storm. The hurricane destroyed 90% of mobile homes in the county, including 99% of mobile homes in <a href="Homestead%2C%20Florida">Homestead</a>. At the <a href="Homestead%20Air%20Reserve%20Base">Homestead Air Force Base</a>, most of the 2,000 buildings on the base were severely damaged or rendered unusable. Damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure. Nearby, in the small town of <a href="Florida%20City%2C%20Florida">Florida City</a>, over 120 homes were demolished and 700 others were damaged, while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair, including City Hall. Further north, damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as <a href="Country%20Walk%2C%20Florida">Country Walk</a> and Saga Bay resembled that of an <a href="Fujita%20scale">F3 tornado</a>, as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from , below the threshold for an F3 tornado. Four of the five condominiums at Naranja Lakes were destroyed. The <a href="Southland%20Mall%20%28Miami%29">Cutler Ridge Mall</a> suffered severe wind and water damage; after the storm, significant looting was reported at that location. More than 50 streets were blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Agriculture suffered extensively as well, with an 85% loss to fruit crops such as avocados, limes, and mangoes. Crop damage in Dade County totaled about $509 million. The county suffered the vast majority of the damage from the hurricane, totaling approximately $25 billion. Andrew left at least 40 deaths in the county, 15 direct and 25 indirect.

Elsewhere, effects were relatively minimal, except in Broward, Monroe, and Collier counties. In Broward County, on the north side of the storm's path, impact in several municipalities was primarily limited to downed trees, several of which fell onto roads and power lines. In <a href="Pembroke%20Park%2C%20Florida">Pembroke Park</a>, one of the worst impacted cities in the county, approximately 260 mobile homes were damaged. Storm surge left coastal flooding in some areas, especially along state roads <a href="Florida%20State%20Road%20A1A">A1A</a> and <a href="Florida%20State%20Road%20858">858</a>. Property damage reached about $100 million and three fatalities were reported in Broward County. In <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a> and <a href="Biscayne%20National%20Park">Biscayne National Park</a>, more than 25% of trees were damaged or destroyed, including one-fourth of the <a href="royal%20palm">royal palm</a>s and one-third of the pine trees in the former. In addition to the damage at Everglades National Park, effects in Monroe County were significant, especially in the Upper Florida Keys. Strong winds damaged billboards, awnings, commercial signs, several boats, planes, trees, and 1,500 homes, with 300 of those becoming uninhabitable. Damage in that county was about $131 million. In <a href="Collier%20County%2C%20Florida">Collier County</a>, to the north of the storm's path, sustained winds up to were observed in <a href="Chokoloskee%2C%20Florida">Chokoloskee</a>. Storm surge flooded low-lying areas, particularly in Goodland, Everglades City, and Marco Island. Many boats were damaged or destroyed by the rough seas and strong winds. The storm destroyed 80 mobile homes and severely damaged 400 others. Property damage in the county reached about $30 million.

After hitting Florida, Andrew moved across the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall about west-southwest of Morgan City in south-central Louisiana; at landfall, the maximum sustained winds were . The highest sustained wind speed observed was , while a wind gust as strong as was recorded; both measurements were taken at the fire station in <a href="Berwick%2C%20Louisiana">Berwick</a>. As it moved ashore, the hurricane produced storm tides of at least above normal, causing flooding along the coast from <a href="Vermilion%20Bay%20%28Louisiana%29">Vermilion Bay</a> to <a href="Lake%20Borgne">Lake Borgne</a>. Off Louisiana, a group of six fishermen from Alabama drowned. Heavy rains accompanied the storm's passage through the state, peaking at in <a href="Robert%2C%20Louisiana">Robert</a>. River flooding was also reported, with the <a href="Tangipahoa%20River">Tangipahoa River</a> in Robert cresting at above flood stage. Before making landfall, Andrew spawned an <a href="Fujita%20scale">F3</a> tornado in <a href="LaPlace%2C%20Louisiana">LaPlace</a>, which killed two people and injuring 32. The tornado was on the ground for about 10 minutes, during which it damaged or destroyed 163 structures, leaving 60 families homeless. Collectively, 14 tornadoes were reported in the parishes of <a href="Ascension%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Ascension</a>, <a href="Iberville%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Iberville</a>, <a href="Pointe%20Coupee%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Pointe Coupee</a>, and <a href="Avoyelles%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Avoyelles</a>, as well as in <a href="Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana">Baton Rouge</a>.

Along the Louisiana coastline, impact largely resembled that of a Category 2 hurricane. Damage was heaviest in <a href="St.%20Mary%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">St. Mary Parish</a>, about east of where Andrew made landfall. Twenty-six schools were impacted, with damage totaling $2.6 million. <a href="Berwick%20High%20School%20%28Louisiana%29">Berwick High School</a>, sheltering about 2,000 people, was deroofed during the storm. Generally, single-family homes fared well, with most losing only roofing shingles, though others suffered severe damage after large trees fell on them. In <a href="Cypremort%20Point%20State%20Park">Cypremort Point State Park</a>, several mobile homes were destroyed. Houses in Berwick, Morgan City, and <a href="Patterson%2C%20Louisiana">Patterson</a> suffered major damage. Throughout the parish, 1,367 dwellings were destroyed, 2,028 were severely damaged, and 4,770 others were impacted to a minor degree. Property damage alone in St. Mary Parish reached approximately $150 million. <a href="Iberia%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Iberia Parish</a> was also among the most severely impacted parishes. Two schools collectively sheltering about 3,600 people in Jeanerette and New Iberia lost their roofs. One death occurred in the parish due to electrocution. A total of 407 residences were demolished, 2,528 others were extensively damaged, and 3,526 others were inflicted with minor damage. Overall, the parish suffered $125 million in property damage, while an additional $200 million in damage was inflicted on sugar crops.

Across the state, the hurricane damaged 23,000 homes and destroyed 985 homes and 1,951 mobile homes; private property damage was estimated at $1 billion. The high winds destroyed large areas of sugar and soybean crops, estimated at $289 million in damage. Strong winds also left at least 230,000 people without electricity. During the storm's passage, upwelling occurred in the <a href="Atchafalaya%20Basin">Atchafalaya Basin</a> and <a href="Bayou%20Lafourche">Bayou Lafourche</a>, killing 187 million freshwater fish. Damage to the fishing industry was estimated at $266 million. Overall, losses in the state of Louisiana reached approximately $1.56 billion. A total of 17 deaths occurred in Louisiana, 8 directly and 9 from indirect causes. At least 75 injuries were reported.

While Andrew was entering the Gulf of Mexico, oil companies evacuated hundreds of employees from offshore drilling platforms. The storm damaged 241 oil and gas facilities and toppled 33 platforms off the coast of Louisiana, causing significant disruptions in production. Additionally, 83 pipeline segments suffered damage to some degree. The oil industry lost about $12 million per day in the days following Andrew and $4 million daily by three weeks later. Initially, a production loss of 240,000 to 270,000 barrels per day occurred – approximately one-third of production throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, Hurricane Andrew caused about $500 million in damage to oil facilities.

As Andrew moved ashore in Louisiana, its outer fringes produced a storm tide of about in <a href="Sabine%20Pass%2C%20Texas">Sabine Pass, Texas</a>. Winds were generally light in the state, reaching in <a href="Port%20Arthur%2C%20Texas">Port Arthur</a>. As Andrew crossed into Mississippi, 3 <a href="severe%20thunderstorm%20warning">severe thunderstorm warning</a>s, 21 <a href="tornado%20warning">tornado warning</a>s, and 16 <a href="flood%20warning">flood warning</a>s were issued. <a href="Funnel%20cloud">Funnel cloud</a>s were observed near the path of the storm, along with 26 tornadoes. Structural damage was generally minimal, occurring from the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. One tornado in <a href="Kemper%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Kemper County</a> destroyed a mobile home, while another twister in <a href="Lauderdale%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Lauderdale County</a> demolished a mobile home, damaged five other dwellings, and injured four people. Additionally, a possible tornado damaged a home and two trailers in <a href="Lawrence%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Lawrence County</a>. Strong winds knocked down trees in the southwestern portion of the state. Much of Mississippi received of rain, while areas near the southwest corner of the state observed over of precipitation, with a peak of at <a href="Sumrall%2C%20Mississippi">Sumrall</a>. Flooding was mostly limited to the inundation of minor roads and low-lying areas in several counties.

In Alabama, precipitation amounts in the state peaked at in <a href="Aliceville%2C%20Alabama">Aliceville</a>. The rainfall caused flooding in low-lying areas and creeks, covering a few county roads but not entering many houses or businesses. Along the coast, the storm produced flooding and high tides. Along <a href="Dauphin%20Island">Dauphin Island</a>, high tides left severe beach erosion, with portions of the island losing up to of sand. Three damaging tornadoes occurred in the state. The most damaging tornado was spawned in <a href="Elmore%20County%2C%20Alabama">Elmore County</a> and moved from an area northeast of <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a> to the south of <a href="Wetumpka%2C%20Alabama">Wetumpka</a> and briefly lifted during its track. The tornado destroyed 2 homes and damaged 18 homes, 1 mobile home, 2 barns, and 1 vehicle. One person was injured by the twister. Sustained winds in the state were below tropical storm force, though a wind gust of 41 mph (67 km/h) was observed in <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville</a>. Although 48 <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Alabama">counties in Alabama</a> reported wind damage, impact across the state was generally minor.

Tropical storm force wind gusts and damaging tornadoes extended eastward into Georgia. Several <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">counties</a> in the northwest and west-central portions of the state reported downed trees and tree limbs and fallen power lines, causing scattered power outages, but structural damage was generally minor. In <a href="Carroll%20County%2C%20Georgia">Carroll County</a>, several dwellings and barns were damaged, with one mobile home destroyed. At the <a href="Columbus%20Metropolitan%20Airport">Columbus Metropolitan Airport</a>, buildings, billboards, and signs were damaged. Additionally, a tornado in <a href="Floyd%20County%2C%20Georgia">Floyd County</a> near <a href="Rome%2C%20Georgia">Rome</a> snapped and uprooted several trees, damaged several fences and homes, and flipped over a trailer, tossing it on top of four cars. Monetary losses in the state reached about $100,000. In <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, thunderstorm winds and tornadoes associated with Andrew downed trees and power lines, but caused little overall impact to homes and buildings. Similarly, in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, thunderstorm winds toppled trees and power lines at a number of locations in the mountainous areas of the state, especially in <a href="Avery%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Avery County</a>. Rainfall from Andrew spread across the southeastern United States along the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> corridor; totals of over 5 in (125 mm) were reported where Georgia and South Carolina meet North Carolina. In <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, the remnants of Andrew combined with a cold front to produce of rain over portions of the state, causing flooding in areas of <a href="Morgantown%2C%20West%20Virginia">Morgantown</a> with poor drainage. The remnants of Andrew also spawned several tornadoes in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. A tornado in <a href="Howard%20County%2C%20Maryland">Howard County</a> damaged several homes, some extensively. The twister also tossed and wrecked a recreational vehicle and its trailer, downed trees, and flattened cornfields. Precipitation continued along the path of Andrew's remnants through the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley, with precipitation measured as far north as <a href="Upstate%20New%20York">Upstate New York</a>.

After the season had ended, the World Meteorological Organization's RA IV Hurricane Committee retired the name "Andrew" from the list of future names for Atlantic tropical cyclones and replaced it with "Alex."
The name "Andrew" will never again be used for another Atlantic Hurricane.

Initially, the Bahamas National Disaster Coordinator believed that <a href="emergency%20management">foreign aid</a> was not required, but shortly after the storm, the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Government of the United Kingdom</a> began distributing blankets, food, ice, and water. , a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="Type%2042%20destroyer">Type 42 destroyer</a>, was the operational guard ship at the time and assisted in relief operations in and around the Gregorytown area. In addition, assistance came from Canada, Japan, and the United States, as well as the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. The <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> delivered 100 tents, 100 rolls of plastic sheeting, and 1,000 cots. Rebuilding began quickly on the hardest hit islands. However, trees and vegetation were expected to take years to recover. Despite reconstruction efforts and the small number of resort lodgings affected (around 2%), officials expected a 10–20% decline in tourism. The <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Bahamas">Bahamian Government</a>, observing that their response mechanisms were not sufficient, reformed the National Emergency and Management Agency.

After assessing the devastation in Florida and Louisiana, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> initially proposed a $7.1 billion aid package to provide disaster benefits, small-business loans, agricultural recovery, food stamps, and public housing for victims of Hurricane Andrew. After the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> appropriated aid to victims of <a href="Hurricane%20Iniki">Hurricane Iniki</a> in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and <a href="Typhoon%20Omar">Typhoon Omar</a> in <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, the cost was later increased to $11.1 billion. The bill, which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time, was passed by <a href="102nd%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> as House Resolution 5620 on September 18, and signed into law by President Bush on September 23. The state of Florida alone received $9 billion through the disaster relief bill.

The <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) was criticized for its slow response in both Florida and Louisiana. Even a month prior to Andrew, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Appropriations">House Committee on Appropriations</a> – which oversees the budget for FEMA – released a report calling the agency a "political dumping ground" and a "turkey farm" due to its "weak, inexperienced leaders". Congressman <a href="S.%20William%20Green">S. William Green</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, a member of the Appropriations Committee, stated that he believed the agency learned little from its botched response to <a href="Hurricane%20Hugo">Hurricane Hugo</a> in 1989. However, Green also criticized local officials for expecting "them [FEMA] to come and run the whole show". Some FEMA officials responded that it was impossible to respond as they had been requested while also continuing to provide aid for the <a href="1992%20Los%20Angeles%20riots">Los Angeles riots</a>. FEMA spokesman Grant Peterson stated, "24 hours is not reasonable to expect to have all the resources of the federal government landing in the middle of a disaster."

In Florida, President Bush assessed damage in areas south of Miami with Florida Governor <a href="Lawton%20Chiles">Lawton Chiles</a>. The president quickly declared the region a disaster area, which provided public assistance to victims of the storm in Broward, Collier, Dade, and Monroe Counties. <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Florida">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="Buddy%20MacKay">Buddy MacKay</a> flew over the impact area and described the scene as looking "like a war zone". Governor Chiles considered asking the <a href="Florida%20Legislature">Florida State Legislature</a> to raise taxes, stating that "No matter how much Congress appropriates to repair damage from Hurricane Andrew, the state will face a substantial cleanup bill". Instead of raising taxes, Chiles signed a bill into law on December 17 that created a three-year reserve fund for losses to uninsured businesses and homes, as well as government and school buildings and functions. Additionally, the bill allowed South Floridians to keep an estimated $500 million in sales tax generated by rebuilding efforts.

Crime, especially looting and theft, rose sharply in the areas south of Miami immediately after Andrew. Reports indicate that merchandise was stolen at damaged or destroyed shopping centers in southern Dade County. Additionally, looting occurred in neighborhoods severely affected by the storm, even in homes where few possessions remained. Initially, the slow response of federal aid prompted Dade County Emergency Management Director Kate Hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference, "Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one? They keep saying we're going to get supplies. For God's sake, where are they?" Almost immediately, President Bush promised, "Help is on the way," and mobile kitchens, food, and tents, along with over 20,000 units from the <a href="Florida%20Army%20National%20Guard">Florida Army National Guard</a> (<a href="124th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">124th Infantry Regiment</a> from Florida); the <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">24th Infantry Division</a> from <a href="Fort%20Stewart">Fort Stewart</a>, the <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division">82nd Airborne Division</a> in <a href="Fort%20Bragg">Fort Bragg</a>, and the <a href="10th%20Mountain%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">10th Mountain Division</a> from <a href="Fort%20Drum">Fort Drum</a>. In order to provide temporary housing for the homeless, military personnel initially set up a total of five tent cities in <a href="Florida%20City%2C%20Florida">Florida City</a> and Homestead, while a sixth tent city was opened at the <a href="Miccosukee%20Indian%20Reservation">Miccosukee Indian Reservation</a> shortly after <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> weekend. The <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Government of Canada</a> dispatched a team 90 <a href="Canadian%20Armed%20Forces">military</a> engineers to repair community centers, hospitals, and schools. Additionally, a crew of 300 military personnel were sent to Miami via "<a href="HMCS%20Protecteur%20%28AOR%20509%29">HMCS Protecteur</a>" to assist American relief teams.

The storm struck Florida in the midst of <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201992">1992 presidential election campaign</a>. A poll conducted by <a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a> in September showed that 65% of Dade County residents approved of Bush's handling of the disaster, while 61% of residents approved statewide. Despite the support of Bush's response and his proposal to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, he benefited little politically and trailed 48–42% against <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> in another poll taken in September. Additionally, 75% of voters in Dade County and 82% of Floridians overall stated that the president's actions in response to Andrew would not impact their vote in November. Bush went on to <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Florida%2C%201992">carry the state of Florida</a>, but by a margin of only 1.89%. The hurricane also impacted Governor Chiles politically. The state's response to the storm was perceived as poor, sinking Chiles' approval rating to 22%, while his disapproval rating rose to 76%. However, Chiles was able to recover prior to the <a href="Florida%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201994">1994 gubernatorial election</a>.

In the aftermath of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery led to increased <a href="divorce">divorce</a> rates and a spike in <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378 adolescents by the <a href="University%20of%20South%20Carolina">University of South Carolina</a>'s Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted <a href="suicide">suicide</a>, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60 children discussed killing themselves between December 1992 and January 1993. A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the <a href="University%20of%20Miami">University of Miami</a> agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to the aftermath of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four <a href="homicide">homicide</a>s.

Although proposals to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base were initially rejected, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> eventually expended over $100 million to begin repairs. Unsalvageable buildings were demolished. Reconstruction then began on a <a href="Florida%20Air%20National%20Guard">Florida Air National Guard</a> tower, air traffic control tower, and maintenance hangars. Next, the rebuilding of communications, medical, security facility, vehicle maintenance, and wing headquarters buildings began. On March 5, 1994, the base reopened as Homestead Air Reserve Base. Prior to Andrew, the base employed approximately 6,500 military personnel and 1,000 civilians and annually added about $450 million to the local economy. After its reopening, <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> Bobby D'Angelo expected the base to annually contribute less than half of that – between $180 million and $200 million. The city of Homestead spent about $6 million on rebuilding the <a href="Homestead%20Sports%20Complex">Homestead Sports Complex</a>. Despite this, the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans, moved their <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> location to <a href="Chain%20of%20Lakes%20Park">Chain of Lakes Park</a> in <a href="Winter%20Haven%2C%20Florida">Winter Haven</a>. As homes were being rebuilt, FEMA provided free temporary mobile homes for 3,501 families and financial assistance to more than 40,000 other families for staying in hotel rooms, paying rent, and repairing homes. Nearly two years after Andrew, about 70% of homes in Homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt. Additionally, of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout Dade County, 36,000 had been restored by July 1994.

More than 930,000 policyholders in South Florida lost coverage after 11 insurance companies went bankrupt, caused by more than 600,000 insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, in an effort to restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in <a href="Carrollton%2C%20Texas">Carrollton, Texas</a>, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.
In July 1996, Governor Chiles established the Florida Building Codes Study Commission, with the purpose of assessing the building codes at the time, as well as enacting improvements and reform to the system. The commission study indicated that building codes and regulations were developed, amended, and administered by over 400 local jurisdictions and state agencies. The Florida Building Code was established in 1998 and put into effect by 2002. It phased out local laws and regulations and replaced them with universal statewide building codes. After hurricanes <a href="Hurricane%20Charley">Charley</a>, <a href="Hurricane%20Frances">Frances</a>, <a href="Hurricane%20Ivan">Ivan</a>, and <a href="Hurricane%20Jeanne">Jeanne</a> in <a href="2004%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2004</a>, a study conducted by the <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> in the following year noted that "Homes built under the new Florida Building Code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001." A report by the Florida Legislature in 2006 after hurricanes <a href="Hurricane%20Dennis">Dennis</a>, <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Katrina</a>, and <a href="Hurricane%20Wilma">Wilma</a> in <a href="2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2005</a> came to a similar conclusion, indicating that "they added further evidence that the Florida Building Code is working."

The hurricane also transformed the demographics of Dade County. A migration of mostly White families northward to Broward and Palm Beach County was ongoing, but accelerated after Andrew. Many of these families had used the money they received from insurance claims to relocate. The population growth was especially noticeable in southwestern Broward County, where land development was pushed "years ahead of schedule". Similar migration occurred within the Jewish community. Although there are areas of Dade County that still have significant Jewish populations, many Jews resettled to <a href="Coral%20Springs%2C%20Florida">Coral Springs</a>, west <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%2C%20Florida">Fort Lauderdale</a>, <a href="Hallandale%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Hallandale Beach</a>, <a href="Plantation%2C%20Florida">Plantation</a>, and <a href="Tamarac%2C%20Florida">Tamarac</a> in Broward County and <a href="Boca%20Raton%2C%20Florida">Boca Raton</a> and <a href="West%20Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida">West Palm Beach</a> in Palm Beach County. The county had a net loss of about 36,000 people in 1992, while Broward and Palm Beach counties gained about 17,000 and 2,300 Dade County residents, respectively. By 2001, 230,710 people had moved from Dade County to Broward County, while 29,125 Dade County residents had moved to Palm Beach County. However, as Broward County became more crowded, 100,871 people relocated from Broward County to Palm Beach County. Consequently, the Hispanic population in south Dade County climbed rapidly. In Homestead, for example, the Latino population increased from 30% to 45% between 1990 and 2000.

During the storm, a facility housing <a href="Burmese%20python">Burmese python</a>s was destroyed, allowing many of them to escape into the Everglades. Although Burmese pythons – native to <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> – had been sighted in Everglades National Park since the 1980s, the destruction of this facility contributed significantly to <a href="Burmese%20pythons%20in%20Florida">the establishment of breeding populations in Florida</a>. Due to rapid reproduction and ability to prey on many species, the population of Burmese pythons exploded, with possibly as many as 300,000 in the Everglades alone. Efforts have been made to curb the thriving population of these <a href="Invasive%20species">invasive</a> snakes, including a ban on importation of the species to the United States since January 2012 and increased regulations on ownership of a boa constrictor or python.

On August 26, George H. W. Bush toured devastated areas of Louisiana with <a href="Governor%20of%20Louisiana">Governor</a> <a href="Edwin%20Edwards">Edwin Edwards</a>. President Bush remarked, "The destruction from this storm goes beyond anything we have known in recent years," but noted that damage was less severe than in Florida. After his visit to Louisiana, President Bush declared only <a href="Terrebonne%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Terrebonne Parish</a> as a disaster area, but later included <a href="List%20of%20parishes%20in%20Louisiana">34 other parishes</a> under this declaration. FEMA initially opened five field offices throughout Louisiana. These centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid. After Franklin mayor Sam Jones and Congressman <a href="Billy%20Tauzin">Billy Tauzin</a> criticized FEMA for failing to open a field office in Franklin, FEMA promised to do so. In the first few days following the storm, <a href="Louisiana%20National%20Guard">Louisiana National Guard</a> members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees, roofing shingles, and torn aluminum siding. The state National Guard also dispatched water purification units and tanks with filled potable water. About 1,300 National Guardsmen were deployed to southern Louisiana.

In early September, officials announced that 1,400 mobile homes, homes, and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable. House Resolution 5620 also included disaster aid to the state of Louisiana. In early December, the <a href="Small%20Business%20Administration">Small Business Administration</a> (SBA) approved $33.2 million worth of low-interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses. By then, FEMA had received about 43,600 applications for aid, while approving $35.9 million in grants to over 18,000 households that were ineligible for loans from the SBA or were uninsured. In addition to the mobile homes already provided, FEMA spent $22.6 million on disaster housing.

Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines

On 11 March 1942, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> and members of his family and staff left the Philippine island of <a href="Corregidor">Corregidor</a> and his forces, which were surrounded by the Japanese. They traveled in <a href="Patrol%20torpedo%20boat">PT boats</a> through stormy seas patrolled by Japanese warships and reached <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> two days later. From there, MacArthur and his party flew to Australia in a pair of <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a>es, ultimately arriving in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> by train on 21 March. In Australia, he made his famous speech in which he declared, "I came through and I shall return".

MacArthur was a well-known and experienced officer with a distinguished record in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, who had retired from the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> in 1937 and had become a defense advisor to the Philippine government. He was recalled to active duty with the United States Army in July 1941, a few months before the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> between the United States and the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>, to become commander of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Forces%20in%20the%20Far%20East">United States Army Forces in the Far East</a> (USAFFE), uniting the Philippine and United States Armies under one command.

By March 1942, the <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281941%E2%80%931942%29">Japanese invasion of the Philippines</a> had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> to <a href="Bataan">Bataan</a>, while his headquarters and his family moved to Corregidor. The doomed defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public. At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.

Fearing that Corregidor would soon fall, and MacArthur would be taken prisoner, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> ordered MacArthur to go to Australia. A submarine was made available, but MacArthur elected to break through the Japanese blockade in PT boats under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20%28junior%20grade%29">Lieutenant (junior grade)</a> <a href="John%20D.%20Bulkeley">John D. Bulkeley</a>. The staff MacArthur brought with him became known as the "Bataan Gang". They would become the nucleus of his General Headquarters (GHQ) <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Southwest Pacific Area</a> (SWPA).

<a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> was a well-known and experienced officer. The son of <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%20Jr.">Arthur MacArthur Jr.</a>, who was awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for his services in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, MacArthur had graduated at the top of the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> class of 1903. He was an <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to his father from 1905 to 1906, and to President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> from 1906 to 1907. During World War I he commanded the 84th Brigade of the <a href="42nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">42nd (Rainbow) Division</a> in the fighting on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. After the war he served as <a href="Superintendent%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Military%20Academy">Superintendent of the United States Military Academy</a>, and as <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the United States Army</a>. He retired from the United States Army in 1937, and became a <a href="Field%20marshal%20%28Philippines%29">field marshal</a> in the <a href="Philippine%20Army">Philippine Army</a>.

MacArthur's job was to advise the Philippine government on defense matters, and prepare the Philippine defense forces when the Philippines became fully independent, which was to be in 1946. The Philippine Army, almost entirely manned and officered by Filipinos with only a small number of American advisors, was raised by conscription, with two classes of 20,000 men being trained each year, starting in 1937. In addition, there was a regular U.S. Army garrison of about 10,000, half of whom were Filipinos serving in the U.S. Army known as <a href="Philippine%20Scouts">Philippine Scouts</a>. When MacArthur was recalled from retirement in July 1941 to become commander of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Forces%20in%20the%20Far%20East">United States Army Forces in the Far East</a> (USAFFE) at the age of 61, he united the Philippine and United States Armies under one command. 
In getting the Philippine Army ready for war, MacArthur faced an enormous task. On a visit to the United States in 1937, MacArthur lobbied the <a href="Navy%20Department">Navy Department</a> for the development of <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s—small, fast boats armed with torpedoes—for which he believed that the geography of the Philippines, with its shallow waters and many coves, was ideally suited. The nascent <a href="Philippine%20Navy">Philippine Navy</a> acquired three, known as "Q" boats, after <a href="President%20of%20the%20Philippines">President</a> <a href="Manuel%20L.%20Quezon">Manuel L. Quezon</a>. In August 1941, the U.S. Navy created <a href="Motor%20Torpedo%20Boat%20Squadron%20Three">Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three</a>, under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20%28junior%20grade%29">Lieutenant (junior grade)</a> <a href="John%20D.%20Bulkeley">John D. Bulkeley</a>. It was a half-strength squadron, with only six PT boats instead of the normal twelve, numbered 31 to 35 and 41. It arrived at Manila in September 1941. It was understood that a fleet consisting of more than PT boats would be required for a successful defense of the Philippines.

As early as 1907, U.S. naval and military planners had concluded that it would be impractical to repel an invasion of the Philippines. The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the <a href="Bataan">Bataan</a> peninsula until help arrived. In the 1920s it was estimated that they could do so for about 60 days. By the 1930s, the planners had become decidedly pessimistic in view of the increased capability of aircraft, and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippines should be written off. But in July 1941, this decision was abruptly reversed, and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend and hold the Philippines. This was based, at least in part, in the belief that <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> bombers could deter or defeat an invading force.

Soon after the <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281941%E2%80%931942%29">Japanese invasion of the Philippines</a> in 1941, MacArthur, in accordance with the pre-war plan, declared Manila an <a href="open%20city">open city</a>, and ordered his forces on <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> to withdraw to Bataan. The Philippine government, the <a href="High%20Commissioner">High Commissioner's</a> office and MacArthur's USAFFE headquarters moved to <a href="Corregidor%20Island">Corregidor Island</a>. Although the dependents of U.S. military personnel had been sent back to the United States, MacArthur was, until his recall from retirement, a Philippine government employee, so his family had remained in the Philippines. MacArthur's wife, <a href="Jean%20MacArthur">Jean MacArthur</a>, and young son, <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%20IV">Arthur MacArthur IV</a>, went with him to Corregidor. Arthur celebrated his fourth birthday on Corregidor, on 21 February 1942. When an aide asked about Arthur's possible fate, MacArthur replied: "He is a soldier's son."

Most of the <a href="United%20States%20Asiatic%20Fleet">United States Asiatic Fleet</a> retired to the south of the Philippines. A small force was left behind under the command of <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Francis%20W.%20Rockwell%20%28admiral%29">Francis W. Rockwell</a> consisting of the <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a> , the submarine rescue ship , <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s , and , <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a> , and , five <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s, three small patrol boats, and the PT boats of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three. The loss of Manila and the <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Base%20Subic%20Bay">U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay</a> meant that fuel and spare parts became scarce. The PT boats relied on "Canopus" and the <a href="floating%20dry%20dock">floating dry dock</a> for assistance with maintenance. Despite this, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three continued to patrol. On 17 December, , and rescued 296 survivors from <a href="HMS%20Engadine%20%281911%29">SS "Corregidor"</a>, which had been carrying refugees to Australia when it struck a mine and sank in Manila Bay. A week later, ran aground while patrolling south of Manila Bay, and was set on fire to prevent her being salvaged by the Japanese. met a similar fate a month later, after its engines failed and it drifted onto a reef. The PT boats attacked enemy barges off Luzon on the night of 23 January 1942, a small Japanese warship on 1 February, and a small vessel, probably a fishing trawler, on 17 February.

In a message to President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, on 11 February, MacArthur announced that he and his family intended to "share the fate of the garrison". This meant surrender at best; MacArthur knew that death from artillery fire or an air raid was also likely. Three days later, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, <a href="George%20C.%20Marshall">George C. Marshall</a>, urged MacArthur to send his family away, but MacArthur ignored this part of the message. Singapore, once considered impregnable, fell on 15 February, and in Washington, the possibility that Corregidor would also fall and MacArthur would be taken prisoner was considered. MacArthur was America's most experienced general, but would be of little use in a prisoner of war camp. Moreover, he had become a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese. The brave but doomed defense of Bataan had captured the imagination of the American public, who saw MacArthur as the only Allied general who knew how to fight the Japanese. <a href="Walter%20R.%20Borneman">Walter R. Borneman</a> noted that:

<a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Cordell%20Hull">Cordell Hull</a> raised the possibility of MacArthur's evacuation. <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> wrote in his diary:

The President considered sending MacArthur to <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> to coordinate the defense of the Philippines from there, but another consideration arose. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">fall of Singapore</a> sealed the fate of the <a href="American-British-Dutch-Australian%20Command">American-British-Dutch-Australian Command</a> (ABDA), of which MacArthur's command was nominally a part. Discussions were held with the British about future command arrangements. A broad agreement was reached that the United States would assume responsibility for the Southwest Pacific. A senior American officer was required, and MacArthur was the obvious choice. On 23 February, MacArthur received a message that had been drafted by the President, <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a> and Marshall. It read:

MacArthur responded with a request that he might select the time of his departure. "Unless the right moment is chosen for this delicate operation", he wrote, "a sudden collapse might occur." "With regard to the actual movement", he went on, "I deem it advisable to go to Mindanao by combined use of surface craft and submarine, and thence by air, further movement by submarine being too time consuming." Marshall replied that the President would allow him to choose the time and method of his departure. ABDA was dissolved on 27 February, and MacArthur nominally came under Dutch command, but was ordered to continue communicating directly with the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a>.

MacArthur inspected the PT boat squadron on 1 March. With air cover provided by his four remaining <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Warhawk</a>s, MacArthur and his wife Jean took a half-hour ride on "<a href="PT-41">PT-41</a>". Although the sea was tranquil, Jean still felt queasy. Ostensibly, the purpose of MacArthur's visit was presenting Bulkeley with the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> for sinking an "unidentified 5,000-ton enemy ship with torpedoes without serious damage to his ship or casualty to his crew", but afterwards MacArthur took Bulkeley aside and asked him if it would be possible to make the journey through uncharted waters at night in PT boats. Bulkeley told him that it would be "a piece of cake."

When some days passed without any further word on the matter, follow-up messages were sent on 6 and 9 March. By 10 March, MacArthur had decided that the Bataan front was not in danger of imminent collapse, and replied that he planned to depart on 15 March, when the submarine was scheduled to arrive at Corregidor. Radio broadcasts in the United States calling for MacArthur to be placed in charge in Australia had been picked up by MacArthur's headquarters in Corregidor, and it had to be assumed that the Japanese had heard them too. There were ominous signs: Japanese surface patrols had been stepped up in the <a href="Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a> area, and there were reports of Japanese destroyers heading north from the southern Philippines. MacArthur therefore elected not to wait for the "Permit", but to leave as soon as possible, by PT boat on the night of 11 March. Major General <a href="Jonathan%20M.%20Wainwright%20%28general%29">Jonathan M. Wainwright</a> was left in command on Bataan and Corregidor. "When I get back", MacArthur told him, "if you're still on Bataan, I'll make you a lieutenant general." Wainwright replied: "I'll be on Bataan if I'm still alive."

Of the decision to depart by PT boat rather than wait for the submarine, <a href="Lieutenant%20%28navy%29">Lieutenant</a> <a href="Robert%20Kelly%20%28naval%20officer%29">Robert B. Kelly</a>, executive officer of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, and commander of "PT-34", later recalled:

Bulkeley and his crews overhauled the PT boats for the voyage. All of the engines had performed hard war service, and had been operated for double the recommended mileage without overhaul. As a result, they were reduced to operating at half speed. Since there were no replacement parts, the <a href="gasket">gasket</a>s, which normally would have been discarded, had to be carefully cleaned and replaced. Each PT boat would carry twenty <a href="55-gallon%20drum">55-gallon drum</a>s of additional fuel on the deck. This reduced the top speed of the boats to about . To make room for the passengers, Bulkeley had to leave 32 of his men behind, who would be sent to fight as infantry on Bataan.

MacArthur's chief of staff, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Richard%20K.%20Sutherland">Richard K. Sutherland</a>, drew up the passenger lists. Rockwell and his chief of staff, Captain <a href="Herbert%20J.%20Ray">Herbert J. Ray</a>, were ordered to accompany MacArthur. They were already under orders to return by submarine, but this was switched to accompanying MacArthur when his date of departure was brought forward. A <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> officer, Brigadier General <a href="Harold%20H.%20George">Harold H. George</a>, was included at the request of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>.

MacArthur was accompanied by his family: his wife Jean, four-year-old son Arthur, and Arthur's <a href="Cantonese%20people">Cantonese</a> "<a href="Amah%20%28occupation%29">amah</a>", Ah Cheu. MacArthur later defended his decision to take her instead of an American nurse. "Few people outside the <a href="Orient">Orient</a>", he wrote, "know how completely a member of the family an "amah" can become, and Ah Cheu had been with us since Arthur's birth. Because of her relationship to my family, her death would have been certain had she been left behind."

In case a doctor was needed, Major Charles H. Morhouse was summoned from Bataan to accompany the party. The remaining thirteen were members of MacArthur's staff, who were loyal and experienced; some had been with MacArthur for years. Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon after arrival in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines, where they would have been taken prisoner. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his <a href="stenographer">stenographer</a>, <a href="Master%20Sergeant">Master Sergeant</a> Paul P. Rogers. Promoted from <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> that day, Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to post.

Because there was no food for the passengers on the PT boats, Jean and MacArthur's aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff, packed tins of food into four <a href="duffel%20bag">duffel bag</a>s, one for each boat. Huff removed the <a href="four-star%20rank">four-star rank</a> number plates from MacArthur's car so they could be used in Australia, and took a mattress for the MacArthurs to lie on. Stories later circulated that it was full of cash or gold. Other stories had it that furniture from MacArthur's residence in the <a href="Manila%20Hotel">Manila Hotel</a> had been loaded on board the PT boats, even, in one version of the story, the piano. In fact, each passenger was limited to one piece of luggage weighing or less. Jean took a small suitcase with some clothes. It sported a label from the <a href="Hotel%20New%20Grand">Hotel New Grand</a> in <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, where she stayed during her honeymoon. Ah Cheu wrapped her possessions in a handkerchief. MacArthur took nothing.

Only "PT-41", which carried MacArthur and his family, departed from Corregidor's North Dock. The passengers of the remaining boats were taken to Bataan in launches and boarded their PT boats there. While his family boarded, MacArthur spoke to Major General <a href="George%20F.%20Moore%20%28general%29">George F. Moore</a>, the commander of the <a href="Harbor%20Defenses%20of%20Manila%20and%20Subic%20Bays">Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays</a>. "George", he told him, "keep the flag flying. I'm coming back."

"PT-41" departed at 19:45 on 11 March and joined the other three 15 minutes later. A navy minelayer led the PT boats through the protective minefield in single file. The boats then assumed a diamond formation, with "PT-41" in the lead and "PT-34" bringing up the rear. If attacked by the Japanese, "PT-41" was to flee while the other three boats engaged the enemy. The seas were moderate, but most of the passengers quickly became seasick. MacArthur later recalled:

During the night, the four boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time looking for the other three boats, but was unable to find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the alternative hiding places. Kelly's "PT-34" was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on <a href="Tagauayan%20Island">Tagauayan Island</a>, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats.

"PT-32", which had only two good engines, had straggled behind the others. Around dawn, Schumacher spotted what appeared to be a Japanese destroyer heading towards him. He jettisoned his fuel drums so he could increase speed and run from it. He ordered his crew to man the .50-caliber machine guns and get ready to launch torpedoes. Akin prepared to toss a barracks bag filled with code books overboard. However, as the light improved, and the vessel drew closer, another look through the binoculars revealed that it was not a Japanese destroyer at all, but "PT-41", carrying an angry Bulkeley. Schumacher was ordered to recover the drums he had jettisoned, but this proved to be a time-consuming task, and a dangerous one in broad daylight, and it had to be abandoned after only a few drums were recovered. Bulkeley had his gunners sink the rest. The two boats then hid for the day in a nearby cove.

In the afternoon, "PT-41" and "PT-32" made their way to Tagauayan, where they found "PT-34". There was a discussion about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for "Permit". Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since "PT-32" had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between "PT-41" and "PT-34". Soon after they had departed, "PT-35" belatedly arrived at the rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of "PT-32" there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for <a href="Cagayan%20de%20Oro">Cagayan de Oro</a> as well.

At 19:00, about an hour after they had left Tagauayan, "PT-34" and "PT-41" spotted a Japanese cruiser. Bulkeley made a sharp turn due west, and headed at top speed, about , into the setting sun. Whether because of the high waves, the glare of the sun, or simple inattentiveness, the cruiser did not spot them. After midnight, the weather began to worsen, with heavy swells and sporadic squalls. Kelly later recalled:

By dawn, the winds and swells had subsided, but the delay caused by the bad weather had slowed the two boats, and they now had to travel across the <a href="Mindanao%20Sea">Mindanao Sea</a> in daylight. Cagayan was sighted shortly after 06:30 on 13 March. Although "PT-34" had led all the way from Tagauayan, Kelly now let Bulkeley take the lead, as he had the channel charts. "PT-41" therefore pulled up at the wharf first, with MacArthur on the bow. They were met by Colonel William Morse, an officer on the staff of the Brigadier General <a href="William%20F.%20Sharp">William F. Sharp</a>, the commander of U.S. forces on Mindanao. MacArthur told Bulkeley "I'm giving every officer and man here the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> for gallantry. You've taken me out of the jaws of death, and I won't forget it."

A few hours later, "PT-35" reached Cagayan. Willoughby later recalled:

USS "Permit", under the command of Lieutenant <a href="Wreford%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BG.%20Chapple">Wreford G. Chapple</a>, reached Tagauayan on 13 March, and found "PT-32". With two of his three engines out of action, Schumacher felt that his boat was no longer seaworthy. He had Chapple destroy the boat with "Permit" deck gun. Chapple then took the fifteen "PT-32" crewmen back to Corregidor. There, eight of the crew were disembarked, while Chapple embarked forty more passengers, thirty-six of them <a href="codebreakers">codebreakers</a>. Nonetheless, Chapple was ordered to conduct a regular war patrol, which he did. He finally reached Australia on 7 April. Unaware of this, Bulkeley attempted to locate "PT-32". Over the next few days he flew over the area as a passenger in various aircraft, including a <a href="Seversky%20P-35">P-35</a> and a <a href="P-40">P-40</a>, in the hope of finding it.

The commander of U.S. Army Forces in Australia, Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Brett%20%28general%29">George H. Brett</a>, received a <a href="Radiogram%20%28message%29">radiogram</a> from General Marshall in Washington, D.C., alerting him that MacArthur would be requesting bombers to transport his party from Mindanao to Australia. A subsequent message from MacArthur requested his "most experienced pilots, and the best available planes in top condition", but the only long-range aircraft that Brett had were Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the <a href="19th%20Airlift%20Wing">19th Bombardment Group</a> which had seen hard service in the Philippines and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">Dutch East Indies campaign</a>s. He therefore approached <a href="Vice%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Leary">Herbert F. Leary</a>, the commander of naval forces in the Anzac Area, to ask for a loan of some of twelve newly arrived Navy B-17s. Leary, who had a reputation for refusing requests unless he could see how the Navy would benefit, turned Brett down.
Brett therefore sent four of the 19th Bombardment Group's old planes. Two were forced to turn back with engine trouble. One of the others accidentally dumped of its fuel. The pilot flew on, and nearly made it to <a href="Del%20Monte%20Field">Del Monte Field</a>, but, just a few miles from his destination, the fuel tanks ran dry and the engines stopped. The B-17 crash landed in the sea. Two of the crew were killed, but the rest made it to shore, and thence to Del Monte Field. Only one B-17, piloted by Lieutenant <a href="Harl%20Pease">Harl Pease</a>, reached Del Monte, and this B-17 was in poor condition, with no brakes and a faulty <a href="supercharger">supercharger</a>. Sharp ordered it back to Australia before MacArthur arrived. Despite the lack of brakes, Pease made the return trip, carrying sixteen passengers.

Thus, with the arrival of "PT-35", all of MacArthur's group had reached Mindanao safely, but there were no aircraft at Del Monte Field to meet them. They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation, where they were lodged in the guest houses, and had breakfast in the clubhouse. MacArthur sent a couple of sharp messages to Brett in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and Marshall in Washington. On their second day there, a Filipino woman arrived who wanted to speak to MacArthur. Her son was fighting on Luzon, and she had walked in the hope that the general would have some news about him. He did not, but the fact that she was aware of MacArthur's presence was disturbing to the party, as the Japanese were only away, at <a href="Davao%20City">Davao</a> on the south coast of Mindanao.
Brett went back to Leary, expecting to be turned down again, but this time, Leary gave Brett the aircraft he wanted. "Perhaps", Brett speculated, "Leary had heard from Washington". The newly formed <a href="40th%20Reconnaissance%20Squadron">40th Reconnaissance Squadron</a> manned the bombers. One B-17 turned back, but two made it to Del Monte Field on 16 March, landing in the dark on a runway lit by flares. Lieutenant Frank P. Bostrom, the pilot of the first plane, calculated that everyone could be carried in just two planes if they left most of their baggage behind. They divided into two groups and the two bombers took off at 01:30 on 17 March. MacArthur rode in the radio operator's seat, which did not need to be manned as the aircraft were travelling under radio silence. For most of the passengers, the trip was dark and cold, with only a blanket between them and the metal skin of the aircraft.

As the two planes approached <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, word was received that a Japanese air raid was in progress there. The two B-17s therefore flew on to <a href="Batchelor%20Airfield">Batchelor Airfield</a>, where they touched down at 09:30. MacArthur awarded Silver Stars to the crews of the two bombers. Brett's chief of staff, Brigadier General <a href="Ralph%20Royce">Ralph Royce</a>, was on hand to greet them, and Brett had sent two <a href="Australian%20National%20Airways">Australian National Airways</a> <a href="DC-3">DC-3</a>s to bring them to Melbourne. However, Jean now refused to fly any further, so MacArthur asked for a motorcade to take them to the nearest railway station, which was at <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a>, away. Sutherland had received word of an incoming Japanese air raid, and asked Morhouse to intervene. Morhouse told MacArthur that Arthur, who had suffered badly from seasickness and airsickness, was on an intravenous feed, and could not guarantee that he would survive the trip across the desert. MacArthur then agreed to take the planes to Alice Springs. Sutherland had Huff hurry everyone onto the aircraft, which took off as the air raid siren sounded.

At Alice Springs, the party split up. MacArthur, his family, Sutherland, Morhouse and Huff took a special train that Brett had borrowed from the Australians, while the rest of the staff flew down to Melbourne via <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> in the DC-3s. His famous speech, in which he said, "I came through and I shall return", was first made at <a href="Terowie%20railway%20station">Terowie railway station</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, on 20 March, where he changed trains. On 21 March, MacArthur's journey was completed when his train rolled into Melbourne's <a href="Southern%20Cross%20railway%20station">Spencer Street station</a>, where he was greeted by the Australian <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29%23Ministers%20for%20the%20Army">Minister for the Army</a>, <a href="Frank%20Forde">Frank Forde</a>.

Roosevelt issued a public statement on 17 March:

On Bataan, the reaction to MacArthur's escape was mixed, with many American and Filipino troops feeling bitter and betrayed. When Wainwright broke the news to his generals "they were all at first depressed by the news … But I soon saw that they understood just as I understood." Some people with family members in the Philippines were dismayed. One wrote to Roosevelt that "Nothing you could have done would have broken their morale and that of their parents at home so thoroughly". Wainwright held out on Corregidor until 6 May. To <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, MacArthur was a "fleeing general", while <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> labeled him a coward. Marshall decided that the best way to counter this was to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor.

In April 1942, Bulkeley led his squadron in an attack on the . The PT boats scored a hit on the cruiser, but the torpedo was a <a href="dud">dud</a>, and failed to explode. No damage resulted. With the loss of <a href="Cebu%20City">Cebu City</a>, there were no more torpedoes, so the active careers of the remaining boats of Bulkeley's squadron came to an end. MacArthur gave PT boat officers a high priority to be flown out from Mindanao. Bulkeley was flown out on MacArthur's orders on 13 April. Knox, Kelly and Akers were evacuated on 23 April, and Brantingham also made one of the last flights out from Mindanao. Sharp surrendered on Mindanao on 10 May.

MacArthur subsequently nominated Bulkeley for the Medal of Honor. The Commander in Chief, <a href="U.S.%20Fleet">U.S. Fleet</a>, <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Ernest%20King">Ernest King</a> was not going to let MacArthur award the Medal of Honor to a naval officer, so he wrote a citation for Bulkeley on behalf of the Navy. Roosevelt presented it to Bulkeley in a ceremony in the <a href="Oval%20Office">Oval Office</a> on 4 August 1942. Bulkeley contributed to a book about his PT squadron's exploits, entitled "They Were Expendable". Parts were serialized in "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" and "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazines and it became a bestseller in 1942. In 1944, it was adapted as a <a href="They%20Were%20Expendable">movie of the same name</a>, with <a href="Robert%20Montgomery%20%28actor%29">Robert Montgomery</a> playing a character based on Bulkeley, <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> one based on Kelly, and <a href="Donna%20Reed">Donna Reed</a> in the role of an Army nurse with whom Kelly had a brief liaison. Postwar analysis found that most of the book's claims were exaggerated.

The staff that MacArthur brought with him from Corregidor formed the nucleus of General Headquarters (GHQ) <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Southwest Pacific Area</a> (SWPA). The "Bataan Gang", as they came to be called, remained with MacArthur for the duration, and were noted for their fanatical loyalty to him. So too was Bulkeley, who lauded MacArthur as "the greatest general as well as statesman since <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>", and hailed his decision to escape on PT boats as a stroke of genius. MacArthur eventually kept his promise, and <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">returned to the Philippines</a>. The Bataan Gang returned to Corregidor in March 1945 on four PT boats.

Nightswimming (Awake)

"Nightswimming" is the eighth episode of the American television <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> fantasy drama "<a href="Awake%20%28TV%20series%29">Awake</a>", which originally aired on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> on April 19, 2012. Written by <a href="Leonard%20Chang">Leonard Chang</a> and co-executive producer <a href="Davey%20Holmes">Davey Holmes</a>, "Nightswimming" was watched by 2.8 million viewers, including 0.9 percent of those aged between 18 and 49 in <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>, upon its initial broadcast in the United States. Directed by executive producer <a href="Jeffrey%20Reiner">Jeffrey Reiner</a>, this episode received generally mixed reviews.

"Awake" centers on <a href="Michael%20Britten">Michael Britten</a> (<a href="Jason%20Isaacs">Jason Isaacs</a>), a detective living in two separate realities after a car crash. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife <a href="Hannah%20Britten">Hannah</a> (<a href="Laura%20Allen">Laura Allen</a>) survived the crash, and in another reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son <a href="Rex%20Britten">Rex</a> (<a href="Dylan%20Minnette">Dylan Minnette</a>) survived. In this episode, Michael helps Accountant Marcus Ananyev (Elijah Alexander) and his wife Alina (<a href="Ayelet%20Zurer">Ayelet Zurer</a>) start a new life in the <a href="United%20States%20Federal%20Witness%20Protection%20Program">Witness Protection Program</a> after a gang member attempts to kill Marcus in the "green reality". In the "red reality", Michael and Hannah prepare for a new life in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> after deciding to move there. They go swimming at a college pool to celebrate their love.

Many commentators praised the storylines of the "red reality", but criticized the arcs of the "green reality". This episode marked the first absence of Rex, as well as the show's two therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (<a href="BD%20Wong">BD Wong</a>) and Dr. Judith Evans (<a href="Cherry%20Jones">Cherry Jones</a>). Although it was the eighth broadcast episode, it was scheduled to be the fifth episode. The music featured in this installment was by <a href="Otis%20Redding">Otis Redding</a>. Michael is seen shirtless in two scenes of this episode, one of which was filmed at an actual campus swimming pool. During filming, a woman who was near the swimming pool confronted Isaacs about his nudity. Several of the episode's themes have been critically examined. It was filmed in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, while eight guest actors starred in this episode.

<a href="Britten%20family">The Brittens</a> are involved in a fatal car crash. As a result, <a href="Michael%20Britten">Michael</a>, a <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a> (LAPD) detective, begins to live in two separate realities. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife <a href="Hannah%20Britten">Hannah</a> (<a href="Laura%20Allen">Laura Allen</a>) survives the crash, and in the other reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son <a href="Rex%20Britten">Rex</a> (<a href="Dylan%20Minnette">Dylan Minnette</a>) survives. Michael does not know which reality is real, and uses the wristbands to differentiate the two.

Michael sees two separate therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (<a href="BD%20Wong">BD Wong</a>) in the "red reality", and Dr. Judith Evans (<a href="Cherry%20Jones">Cherry Jones</a>) in the "green reality". Meanwhile, in the "red reality", Michael and Hannah continue with their plan to move to <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. Michael works with Detective Isaiah "Bird" Freeman (<a href="Steve%20Harris%20%28actor%29">Steve Harris</a>) in the "green reality" and with Detective Efrem Vega (<a href="Wilmer%20Valderrama">Wilmer Valderrama</a>) in the "red reality" after the crash.

In the "red reality", two police officers are sitting in a car talking when they receive a report of a break-in at a local college swimming pool. They see Michael running naked from the pool and chase him; when they tell him to stop running, Michael identifies himself as a detective. Meanwhile, in the "green reality", Accountant Marcus Ananyev (Elijah Alexander) exits his house and makes a phone call. Marcus then walks over to his car and tries to start it, but notices a bomb in the car's engine and runs away shortly before it explodes. Soon after, at the police station, Michael and Bird tell Marcus that they will protect him. Marcus' wife, Alina (<a href="Ayelet%20Zurer">Ayelet Zurer</a>), comes into the station, where Marcus explains what has happened. Shortly after talking with Marcus and Alina, Michael and Bird take the couple to a hotel for temporary shelter. In the "red reality", Michael notices Hannah cleaning up and packing items before they move to Oregon. Soon after, Michael takes Vega to meet his confidential informant (CI), Jake (<a href="Steve%20Lawrence">Steve Lawrence</a>), with whom he will work after Michael leaves. Jake does not want to work with Vega for an unknown reason, but gives the pair a tip about a warehouse.

That night, Michael, Vega and the <a href="SWAT">SWAT</a> team watch the warehouse but no one shows up; Vega wonders if Jake had given incorrect information. Back in the "green reality", Michael goes to the hotel, since Alina had left in the middle of the night. Once there, Marcus warns Michael and Bird that if they do not find her, Marcus will give himself up to Maxim Basayev, his mobster boss. Back at the station, after looking at evidence, Michael decides to talk to the hotel staff where Alina and Marcus are staying, with Bird, rather than Alina's friends. Later, Michael and Bird go to the home of Greg Hollander (Ron Melendez), one of Alina's friends, but do not find Greg, the person they would like to question regarding Alina's whereabouts. Hollander, who is tied up, kicks down a table as the detectives leave, notifying the cops that he is in there. As the criminals run away, Bird and Michael break into the house; Bird and Michael enter the house, while Bird shoots the two gang members. After that, they speak to Greg, who tells them that Alina constantly talks about how she and her husband have grown apart. Michael goes to search for Alina at a beach and finds her there. The two talk about Marcus and everything that happened previously. Michael explains that she has a chance to start over and takes her back to the hotel. In the "red reality", at Jake's home, Jake says he and Vega can have dinner alone to get to know each other. That night, Michael and Hannah go <a href="nude%20swimming">nude swimming</a> at the college pool.

"Nightswimming" was the first episode of the series to have been written by <a href="Leonard%20Chang">Leonard Chang</a> and co-executive producer <a href="Davey%20Holmes">Davey Holmes</a>; Chang later helmed "<a href="Say%20Hello%20to%20My%20Little%20Friend">Say Hello to My Little Friend</a>" and the series' finale "<a href="Turtles%20All%20the%20Way%20Down%20%28Awake%29">Turtles All the Way Down</a>", while Holmes went on to write the teleplay of "<a href="Two%20Birds%20%28Awake%29">Two Birds</a>". The entry was directed by executive producer <a href="Jeffrey%20Reiner">Jeffrey Reiner</a>, his third directing credit for the show. Reiner also directed two earlier installments—"<a href="The%20Little%20Guy">The Little Guy</a>" and "<a href="Guilty%20%28Awake%29">Guilty</a>", the second and third entries of the program. Stuart Blatt served as the episode's production designer, while Todd Desrosiers edited the music.

This entry was rated <a href="TV-14">TV-14</a> in the United States during its original broadcast on television. Although it was the eighth broadcast episode, it was scheduled to be the fifth episode, until <a href="NBC">NBC</a> decided to change the broadcasting order. The entry's production code was "1ATR06". "Nightswimming" marked the first absence of Rex, as well as the show's two therapists: Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans. Eight cast members guest starred in this entry. Actress <a href="Laura%20Innes">Laura Innes</a> returned to the episode as Captain Tricia Harper, while Lawrence made his first and only appearance as Jake. Alexander, Zurer, Melendez, Blackman, Holden and Todorov also made their first and only appearances as Marcus, Alina, Hollander, Vasily, Shapiro and Alexander, respectively. This entry featured , a song by <a href="Otis%20Redding">Otis Redding</a>, which was played during one of a number of scenes where Michael is seen shirtless.

The installment was filmed and set in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, as were all other "Awake" episodes. During filming of the installment, Isaacs thought it would be funny to <a href="mooning">moon</a> down the stairs during a scene in which Hannah and Michael go nude swimming, but stated that it would probably break the <a href="Standards%20and%20Practices">Standards and Practices</a> law. Filming of the episode commenced at an actual campus swimming pool for one scene. A lady present during filming asked if Isaacs was naked. Isaacs replied that he was not completely naked, but had a "small piece of material taped over [his] genitals"; the lady said "That's naked," adding "I can see your butt crack." In response, Isaacs "taped a piece of material over [his] butt crack". When the last scene was filmed that day, he ran up the stairs, causing the material—which had been secured only by a piece of sealing tape—to fall off. The woman was "furious". Isaacs thought that the team of "Awake" would have to withdraw the footage, but was happy to see that part was included in the finished episode.

Although it did not directly impact the ongoing storyline of "Awake", "Nightswimming" introduced and continued key thematic elements of the series. It was described as a "long, roundabout" episode that is "bent on making [Michael] fully commit to moving to Oregon with Hannah" by Matt Fowler from "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>". Fowler thought that, since Rex was not in the episode, the "green reality" seemed more like a dream. In a review of the following episode, "<a href="Game%20Day%20%28Awake%29">Game Day</a>", he admitted that he thought Alina was behind Marcus' car bomb, since he thought that this story would have an arrest by the end. Writing for <a href="HitFix">HitFix</a>, <a href="Alan%20Sepinwall">Alan Sepinwall</a> opined that Michael is "coming to grips with Hannah's desire to move because he loves her that much". However, the Brittens later decided not to move in "<a href="Slack%20Water">Slack Water</a>", the series' tenth episode, owing to personal concerns.

Sepinwall noted that he could see "the obvious parallels to Michael's personal situation" in this installment, while "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" editor Zack Handlen said that "Awake" "continues to connect routine procedural storylines and find new ways to give them deeper meaning". Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman said that this episode was about "bringing two people who have drifted apart back together" and that "Nightswimming" has "balanced the series' larger mystery with grief and a twinge of optimism" on a "smaller scale" compared to other entries of the program. He claimed that the installment was designed to "introduce us to what makes Hannah and Michael so special", adding that "For most of the series, there hasn't been much chemistry between the two".

In his real reality check, a prediction on which reality is real by the end of the particular episode, Nick McHatton, a "TV Fanatic" writer, chose the "red reality", because it was "nice to see why Hannah and Michael love each other", while Handlen claimed that "the show has done a fine job at largely standalone episodes", but each episode "feels like its own separate story". He assumed that "there's little feel of rising intensity or greater danger", "given the hints of conspiracy and the ever intensifying threat of Oregon". Caroline Preece of "Den of Geek" initially assumed "this random nakedness will tie in to the show's central mythology", though she later found out Michael was just swimming nude with Hannah. Preece thought that Hannah and Michael "reconnected" in the episode, as did McHatton. Due to Rex's absence, she thought that this episode allowed viewers to get to know Hannah.

"Nightswimming" originally aired on NBC on April 19, 2012, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="Sky%20Atlantic">Sky Atlantic</a> on June 22, 2012. According to <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>, an <a href="audience%20measurement">audience measurement</a> system that determine the audience size and composition of <a href="broadcast%20programming">television programming</a>, the episode's initial broadcast in the United States was viewed by approximately 2.8 million viewers and earned a 0.9 rating/2 percent share in the 18–49 demographic, meaning that it was seen by 0.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 2 percent of 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. In the United Kingdom, the episode obtained 287,000 viewers, making it the second most-viewed program for that channel behind "<a href="Hit%20%26amp%3B%20Miss">Hit & Miss</a>".

This episode received generally mixed reviews from critics. Sepinwall was disappointed with the overall storyline of the "green reality"; he claimed that if the episode was only based on the "red reality", the entry would have been "perfectly fine". Meanwhile, Handlen thought that if the arcs of the "red reality" were not included in this installment, it would not work as an episode. While Sepinwall called the "green reality" storyline "boring", Handlen thought that the storylines of Marcus and Alina did not "matter"; according to Handlen, the episode should not have gotten into the details of the guest stars. Sepinwall and Handlen were disappointed that Rex did not appear in the episode; Handlen praised Rex, calling him a "likable teenage boy" who deserves more running time.

Handlen thought that Michael sounded "reasonable", and Sepinwall said ""Awake"...[has previously done] a good job of making the guest characters involved in [Michael]'s cases interesting enough that I care about what happens in each investigation." He thought that until this episode the writers had been wise on guest stars and on not focusing on them too much; he also wrote that actors Lawrence and Valderrama did not seem to match each other. Handlen was rather impressed with the storylines of the "red reality" and gave the episode a "B+", writing that "Jake reminded [him] of <a href="Al%20Pacino">Al Pacino</a>'s aging [gang member] in "<a href="Donnie%20Brasco%20%28film%29">Donnie Brasco</a>"." Sepinwall liked Jake's actor, Lawrence, praising his appearance on the "Awake" episode.

Fowler showed disappointment as the entry gave no "twists" or "problems" regarding Michael, or his therapy sessions. He compared "Nightswimming" to other "Awake" episodes, claiming that other entries offer more "plot" and "emotional" problems, while Preece called the entry "strange". She thought that the storylines of the "red reality" were more "interesting" than the "green reality" storylines, and Fowler was disappointed with the song choice for the installment, claiming that the <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a> song "<a href="Nightswimming">Nightswimming</a>" should have been played instead. Preece described the "Nightswimming" episode as a "dull procedural episode" that is devoid of any mythology or forward motion; she called the installment "flat". Despite saying that she was "losing patience" with "Awake", Preece said that she was still "keen" to see more.

While Preece wrote that the episode was missing key elements from previous episodes, Fowler criticized the installment, since the first fifteen minutes of the entry were about Marcus and Elena and their lives. Despite this, Fowler praised the final scene of the episode, and Preece called Michael and Hannah's relationship "lovely". Fowler gave this a "7.5" "good" rating, the lowest score for an "Awake" episode at that time. Preece thought that the episode made "little mistakes", which "Awake" could not afford to make. McHatton said that "Nightswimming" contains "No conspiracies, no killers, not even murders", just a "procedural case that mirrored [Michael]'s life at home". Despite this, he praised Michael and Hannah's relationship, claiming that "it's nice to watch as they reconnect with each other"; he gave it a "4.5" rating out of "5.0". Meanwhile, Yeoman stated that the entry opened to "a certain amount of whimsy" and that, "starting [the episode] off with the series' protagonist in the buff isn't exactly textbook."

Sudirman

<a href="Jenderal%20Besar">General of the Army</a> <a href="Priyayi%23Titles">Raden</a> Soedirman (<a href="Enhanced%20Indonesian%20Spelling%20System">Perfected Spelling</a>: Sudirman; 24 January 1916 – 29 January 1950) was a high-ranking Indonesian military officer during the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>. The first <a href="Indonesian%20Military%20Commander%23Commander%20of%20the%20Indonesian%20National%20Armed%20Forces">commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces</a>, he continues to be widely respected in the country.

Born in <a href="Purbalingga">Purbalingga</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, Soedirman moved to <a href="Cilacap">Cilacap</a> in 1916 and was raised by his uncle. A diligent student at a <a href="Muhammadiyah">Muhammadiyah</a>-run school, he became respected within the community for his devotion to Islam. After dropping out of teacher's college, in 1936 he began working as a teacher, and later headmaster, at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school. After the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupied the Indies</a> in 1942, Soedirman continued to teach, before joining the Japanese-sponsored <a href="Pembela%20Tanah%20Air">Defenders of the Homeland</a> as a battalion commander in <a href="Banyumas">Banyumas</a> in 1944. In this position he put down a rebellion by his fellow soldiers, but was later interned in <a href="Bogor">Bogor</a>. After <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">Indonesia proclaimed its independence</a> on 17 August 1945, Soedirman led a break-out then went to Jakarta to meet President <a href="Soekarno">Soekarno</a>. Tasked with overseeing the surrender of Japanese soldiers in Banyumas, he established a division of the People's Safety Body there. On 12 November 1945, at an election to decide the military's commander-in-chief in <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, Soedirman was chosen over <a href="Oerip%20Soemohardjo">Oerip Soemohardjo</a> in a close vote. While waiting to be confirmed, Soedirman ordered an assault on British and Dutch forces in <a href="Ambarawa">Ambarawa</a>. The ensuing battle and British withdrawal strengthened Soedirman's popular support, and he was ultimately confirmed on 18 December.

During the following three years Soedirman saw negotiations with the returning Dutch colonial forces fail, first after the <a href="Linggadjati%20Agreement">Linggadjati Agreement</a> – which Soedirman participated in drafting – and then the <a href="Renville%20Agreement">Renville Agreement</a>; he was also faced with internal dissent, including a <a href="Madiun%20Affair">1948 "coup d'état" attempt</a>. He later blamed these issues for his <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, which led to his right lung <a href="plombage">being collapsed</a> in November 1948. On 19 December 1948, several days after Soedirman's release from the hospital, the Dutch launched an <a href="Operation%20Kraai">assault on the capital</a>. Soedirman and a small contingent escaped Dutch forces and left the city, making their headquarters at Sobo, near <a href="Mount%20Lawu">Mount Lawu</a>. There Sudirman commanded military activities throughout Java, including a <a href="show%20of%20force">show of force</a> in Yogyakarta on 1 March 1949. When the Dutch began withdrawing, in July 1949 Soedirman was recalled to Yogyakarta and forbidden to fight further. In late 1949 Sudirman's tuberculosis relapsed, and he retired to <a href="Magelang">Magelang</a>, where he died slightly more than a month after the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence. He is buried at <a href="Kusumanegara%20Heroes%27%20Cemetery">Semaki Heroes' Cemetery</a> in Yogyakarta.

Soedirman's death was grieved throughout Indonesia, with flags flown at <a href="half-mast">half-mast</a> and thousands gathering to see his funeral convoy and procession. He continues to be highly respected in Indonesia. His guerrilla campaign has been credited with developing the army's "<a href="esprit%20de%20corps">esprit de corps</a>", and the long route he took must be followed by Indonesian <a href="cadet">cadet</a>s before graduation. Soedirman featured prominently on the 1968 series of <a href="Indonesian%20rupiah">rupiah</a> banknotes, and has numerous streets, museums, and monuments named after him. On 10 December 1964, he was declared a <a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Indonesia">National Hero of Indonesia</a>.

Sudirman was born to Karsid Kartawiraji (father) and Siyem while they lived with Siyem's sister Tarsem, one of three women married to the sub-district head <a href="Priyayi">Raden</a> Cokrosunaryo, in Rembang, Bodas Karangjati, <a href="Purbalingga">Purbalingga</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. According to the family's records, Sudirman – named by his uncle – was born on a <a href="Javanese%20calendar%23Wetonan%20cycle">"pon" Sunday</a> in the month of Maulud in the <a href="Javanese%20calendar">Javanese calendar</a>; the Indonesian government later established 24 January 1916 as Sudirman's birthday. As Cokrosunaryo was in a better financial situation, he adopted Sudirman and gave him the title Raden, reserved for <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a> nobility; however, Sudirman was not told that Cokrosunaryo was not his birth father until he was eighteen. When Cokrosunaryo retired from his position as chief in late 1916, Sudirman went with the family to Manggisan, <a href="Cilacap">Cilacap</a>, where he was raised. In Cilacap Karsid and Siyem had another son, Muhammad Samingan. Karsid died when Sudirman was six, at which time Siyem left the boys with her brother-in-law and went back to her village at Parakan Onje, Ajibarang.

Sudirman was raised with stories of heroic deeds and taught the etiquette and ways of the "<a href="priyayi">priyayi</a>", or noble caste, as well as the work ethic and simplicity of the "<a href="wong%20cilik">wong cilik</a>", or commoners. For his religious education, he studied Islam under <a href="Kyai">Kyai</a> <a href="Hajji">Hajji</a> Qahar with his brother; Sudirman was a religious child, and always <a href="salat">prayed</a> on time. He was soon entrusted with performing both the "<a href="adhan">adhan</a>" and "<a href="iqama">iqama</a>", or calls to prayer. When he was seven years old, Sudirman was enrolled at a school for natives (), where he was an average student. The family, although it had enough to live by, was not rich. During his tenure as sub-district head, Cokrosunaryo had not accumulated much wealth, and in Cilacap he became a distributor of <a href="Singer%20Corporation">Singer</a> sewing machines.

In his fifth year of school, Sudirman asked to leave his studies, concerned with the ridicule he faced at the government-run school; this request was at first refused, but Sudirman was transferred to a junior high school run by <a href="Taman%20Siswa">Taman Siswa</a> in his seventh year of school. In his eighth year, Sudirman transferred to Wirotomo Junior High School after the Taman Siswa School was found to be unregistered and closed under the Wild School Ordinance. Many of Sudirman's teachers at Wirotomo were <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Awakening">Indonesian nationalists</a>, which influenced his views of the Dutch colonists. Sudirman studied diligently at school; his teacher Suwarjo Tirtosupono later recalled that Sudirman would already be studying second-term lessons while the class was still in term one. Although he performed poorly in <a href="Javanese%20alphabet">Javanese calligraphy</a>, Sudirman was strong in mathematics, science, and writing in both Dutch and Indonesian. Sudirman also became more religious under the guidance of his teacher Raden Mohamad Kholil; his classmates named him "hajji" because of his devotion to his prayers, and Sudirman took up preaching to other students. Aside from his studies and religious activities, Sudirman also served in the school's musical troupe and on the <a href="association%20football">football</a> team, on which he was a <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a>. Although Cokrosunaryo's death in 1934 left the family poor, Sudirman was allowed to continue his studies without paying until he graduated later that year; after his step-father's death, Sudirman also devoted more time to studying the <a href="Sunnah">Sunnah</a> and prayer. By age 19, Sudirman had become a <a href="pupil%20teacher">pupil teacher</a> at Wirotomo.

While at Wirotomo Sudirman was a member of the Wirotomo Student Union, drama club, and band. He helped establish a branch of the Hizboel Wathan, an organisation similar to the <a href="World%20Organization%20of%20the%20Scout%20Movement">Boy Scouts</a>, which was run by the Islamic establishment <a href="Muhammadiyah">Muhammadiyah</a>. Sudirman became the leader of the Cilacap division after graduating from Wirotomo; he was tasked with deciding and planning his groups' activities. He emphasised the need for religious studies, insisting that the contingents from Cilacap attend Muhammadiyah conferences throughout Java. He taught the younger members about the history of Islam and the importance of morality, while with older members he enforced near-military discipline.

After graduating from Wirotomo, Sudirman spent a year at a Muhammadiyah-run <a href="Normal%20school">teacher's college</a> in <a href="Surakarta">Surakarta</a>, but later dropped out owing to a lack of funds. In 1936 he returned to Cilacap to teach at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school, having been trained by his teachers at Wirotomo; that year he married Alfiah, a former schoolmate and the daughter of the rich "<a href="batik">batik</a>" merchant Raden Sastroatmojo. After the marriage Sudirman lived at his father-in-law's house in Cilacap so he could save money for his own home. The couple went on to have three sons, Ahmad Tidarwono, Muhammad Teguh Bambang Tjahjadi, and Taufik Effendi, and four daughters, Didi Praptiastuti, Didi Sutjiati, Didi Pudjiati, and Titi Wahjuti Satyaningrum.

As a teacher, Sudirman taught his students lessons on morality using examples from the lives of the <a href="Prophets%20in%20Islam">prophets</a> and traditional "<a href="wayang">wayang</a>" stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20gulden">gulden</a> to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.

During this time Sudirman also continued to serve as a member of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group. Within the group he was known as a keen negotiator and mediator, working to resolve issues between members; he also <a href="dawah">preached</a> at the local mosque. He was elected as Chair of the Banyumas District of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group at the end of 1937. In this role he enacted policies facilitating members' studies and activities, both religious and secular. He was later put in charge of Youth Group activities throughout <a href="Central%20Java">Central Java</a> and spent much of his free time travelling and preaching Islam, putting an emphasis on self-awareness. Alfiah was also active in Muhammadiyah-sponsored activities through the group's branch for women, Nasyiatul Aisyiyah.

When World War II broke out in Europe, it was expected that the Japanese, who had already made aggressive moves against mainland China, would try to invade the Indies. In response, the Dutch colonial government – which had previously limited military training for <a href="native%20Indonesians">native Indonesians</a> – began teaching the populace how to deal with <a href="strategic%20bombing">air raids</a>. To co-ordinate the preparations, the Dutch formed Air Raid Preparation teams. Sudirman, respected in the community, was asked to lead the Cilacap chapter. Aside from teaching local citizens the safety procedures for dealing with an air raid, Sudirman established watchposts throughout the area. He and the Dutch would also have passing aircraft drop materials to simulate a bombing run; this was intended to improve response time.

After the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese began occupying the Indies</a> in early 1942, winning several battles against Dutch and Dutch-trained forces of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20East%20Indies%20Army">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a> (, or KNIL), on 9 March 1942 Governor-General <a href="Tjarda%20van%20Starkenborgh%20Stachouwer">Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer</a> and head of the KNIL General <a href="Hein%20ter%20Poorten">Hein ter Poorten</a> capitulated. This brought drastic changes in the governance of the archipelago and reduced the quality of life for non-Japanese in the Indies, many of whom suffered from widespread human rights violations at the hands of the Japanese. In Cilacap, Sudirman's school had been closed and turned into a military outpost; this was part of a widespread effort to close private schools. After Sudirman convinced the Japanese to reopen the school, he and the other teachers were forced to use substandard supplies. Sudirman was also involved in several social and humanitarian organisations during this period, including as chair of the Indonesian People's Cooperation. This brought him greater recognition among the people of Cilacap.

In early 1944, after a year as a representative at the Japanese-run regency council board ("Syu Sangikai"), Sudirman was asked to join the <a href="Pembela%20Tanah%20Air">Defenders of the Homeland</a> (, or PETA); the Japanese occupation government had established PETA in October 1943 to help repel any <a href="Allies%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Allied</a> invasion, and were focused on recruiting younger men, those who had "not yet been 'contaminated by Dutch rule. After a few days of hesitance, caused in part by a knee injury he had occurred as a youth, Sudirman agreed to begin training in <a href="Bogor">Bogor</a>. Owing to his standing in the community, Sudirman was made a commander ("daidanco") and trained with other persons of that rank. Trained by Japanese officers and soldiers, the cadets were armed with confiscated Dutch equipment. After four months of training Sudirman was put in charge of the battalion stationed at Kroya, <a href="Banyumas">Banyumas</a>, Central Java, not far from Cilacap.

Sudirman's time as a PETA commander passed uneventfully until 21 April 1945, when PETA troops under the command of Kusaeri began to rebel against the Japanese. Ordered to stop the rebellion, Sudirman agreed to do so only if the PETA rebels would not be harmed, and places harbouring them not razed; this condition was accepted by the Japanese commander, and Sudirman and his troops began searching for the rebels. Although Kusaeri's men initially shot at the commander, after Sudirman used a loudspeaker to tell them they would not be harmed, they backed down. Kusaeri surrendered on 25 April. This garnered support for Sudirman within the occupation forces, although several high-ranking Japanese officers expressed concern over Sudirman's support for Indonesian independence. Sudirman and his men were soon sent to a camp in Bogor, ostensibly for training; however, they were tasked with hard labour as a way to prevent a further uprising, and rumours circulated that the PETA officers would be killed.

After news of the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> reached the Indies in early August 1945, followed by the <a href="proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20independence">proclamation of Indonesian independence</a> on 17 August, it was evident that Japanese control was weakening. Sudirman led a break out from the camp in Bogor. Although his fellow internees wanted to attack the Japanese soldiers, Sudirman convinced them against it. After ordering the others to their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> and met with President <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>, who asked him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19 August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces were in the process of retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8 September 1945.

In late August, Sukarno established the People's Safety Bureau (, or BKR), which united troops from the former PETA, Heihō, and KNIL. The BKR served mostly as a police organisation, partly because the political leadership were intent on using diplomacy to garner international recognition of the new country and partly to avoid appearing overly aggressive to the Japanese forces still in the archipelago. Sudirman and several of his fellow PETA soldiers formed a BKR branch in Banyumas in late August, after stopping at Kroya and discovering that his battalion had been disbanded. In a meeting with the Japanese commander for the region, Saburo Tamura, and the <a href="Resident%20%28title%29">resident</a> of Banyumas, Iwashige, Sudirman and Iskak Cokroadisuryo forced the Japanese to surrender and hand over their weapons while a crowd of armed Indonesians encircled the Japanese camp. Many of these weapons were later used by Sudirman's BKR unit, making it one of the best equipped in the country; surplus weapons were distributed to other battalions.

As the newly independent nation did not yet have a professional military, on 5 October 1945 Sukarno passed a decree establishing the <a href="Indonesian%20Army">People's Security Armed Forces</a> ( or TKR, now known as the ). Most officers were former KNIL officers, while rank-and-file soldiers were mostly PETA and Heihō personnel. As the decreed Commander of the Armed Forces, <a href="Soeprijadi">Soeprijadi</a>, failed to come forward, chief of staff Lieutenant General <a href="Oerip%20Soemohardjo">Oerip Soemohardjo</a> served as an interim leader. That October British-led forces, tasked with disarming Japanese troops and repatriating Dutch <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>, arrived in <a href="Semarang">Semarang</a>, then made their way south to <a href="Magelang">Magelang</a>. When the British began rearming repatriated Dutch prisoners and seemed to be preparing a military base in Magelang, Sudirman – now a colonel – sent some of his troops under Lieutenant Colonel Isdiman to drive them away; the mission was successful, and the European soldiers withdrew to <a href="Ambarawa">Ambarawa</a>, midway between Magelang and Semarang. On 20 October Sudirman was put in command of the Fifth Division, after Oerip began dividing Java into different military commands.

On 12 November 1945, at the first general meeting of Army leadership, Sudirman was elected Commander of the Armed Forces ("Panglima Besar") following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21 votes to Sudirman's 22; the division commanders from <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> voted unanimously for Sudirman and swayed the ballot in his favour. Sudirman, aged 29 at the time, was surprised at his selection and offered to relinquish the leadership position to Oerip, but the meeting did not allow it. Oerip himself, who had lost control of the meeting prior to the vote, was glad to no longer be in charge of the entire Army. Sudirman kept Oerip to serve as chief of staff under him. In accordance with his new role, Sudirman was promoted to general. After the meeting, Sudirman returned to Banyumas to await confirmation as leader of the TKR and began developing strategies on how repel Allied advances. The Indonesians feared that the Dutch, through the <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20Civil%20Administration">Netherlands Indies Civil Administration</a> (, or NICA), would attempt to retake the archipelago; soldiers of the Dutch-British alliance had landed in Java in September, and a <a href="battle%20of%20Surabaya">large battle</a> had occurred in Surabaya during late October and early November. This instability, as well as Sukarno's uncertainty about Sudirman's qualifications, led to a delay in Sudirman's confirmation.

While waiting for his appointment to be confirmed, in late November Sudirman ordered the Fifth Division to attack Allied forces stationed in Ambarawa, once again with Isdiman in charge; the city was considered strategically important owing to its military barracks and training facilities dating from the colonial period. This assault was countered by an air strike and the use of tanks, which forced the division to retreat; Isdiman died in the battle, killed by a <a href="strafing">strafing</a> <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> Sudirman then led the Division in another assault against Allied forces; the Indonesian troops were armed with a variety of weapons, ranging from bamboo spears and confiscated <a href="katana">katana</a>s to rifles, while the British were armed with modern equipment. Sudirman led from the front, wielding a katana. The Allies, whose air support had been cut off when <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a> soldiers attacked Kalibanteng Airfield in Semarang, were forced onto the defensive and holed up in Willem Fortress. On 12 December Sudirman led a four-day siege, which resulted in the Allied force withdrawing to Semarang.
The Battle of Ambarawa brought Sudirman greater attention at a national level, and generally silenced whispers that he was unfit for military command because of his lack of military experience and previous employment as a schoolteacher. Ultimately, Sudirman was chosen as his loyalty was undoubted, while Oerip's former pledge of loyalty to the Dutch led to him being viewed with suspicion. Sudirman was confirmed as commander of the Armed Forces on 18 December 1945. He was replaced as head of the Fifth Division by Colonel Sutiro, and began to focus on strategic problems. This was done partly by establishing a board of advisors, which gave the general advice on both political and military issues. Oerip handled many of the military matters.

Together, Sudirman and Oerip were able to reduce the differences and mistrust between former KNIL and PETA troops, although some troops were reluctant to be subordinated to a central command, instead choosing to follow their popularly selected battalion commanders. The government renamed the Army twice in January 1946, first to the Peoples' Salvation Armed Forces (), then to the Republic of Indonesia Military Forces (, or TRI/RIMF). This was followed by the formal establishment of a <a href="Indonesian%20Navy">navy</a> and <a href="Indonesian%20Air%20Force">air force</a> in early 1946. In the meantime, the Indonesian government had moved from Jakarta – now under Dutch control – to Yogyakarta in January; delegates led by Prime Minister <a href="Sutan%20Sjahrir">Sutan Sjahrir</a> spent much of April and May unsuccessfully negotiating for Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty. On 25 May Sudirman was reconfirmed as commander of the Armed Forces of the expanded military, after its reorganisation. At the ceremony, Sudirman swore to protect the republic "until he shed his last drop of blood."

The leftist Minister of Defence <a href="Amir%20Sjarifuddin">Amir Sjarifuddin</a>, who had received greater power in the reorganisation, began collecting socialist and communist troops under his direct control, as well as leftist paramilitary units () that were funded by and loyal to the various political parties. The minister instituted <a href="political%20education">political education</a> programmes in the army, which were meant to spread leftist ideology. This use of the military for political manoeverings disappointed both Sudirman and Oerip, who were at the time busy ensuring equal treatment for soldiers from different military backgrounds. However, rumours among the populace had spread that Sudirman was preparing for a "coup d'état"; although an attempt did occur in early July 1946, Sudirman's role, if any, is not certain. In July Sudirman addressed these rumours through a speech broadcast on <a href="Radio%20Republik%20Indonesia">Radio Republik Indonesia</a> (RRI), stating that he, like all Indonesians, was a servant of the State, and that, if he were offered the presidency, he would refuse it. In his later career he stated that the military had no place in politics, and vice versa.

Meanwhile, Sjahrir continued to work on negotiations with the Allied forces. On 7 October 1946, Sjahrir and the former Dutch Prime Minister, <a href="Wim%20Schermerhorn">Wim Schermerhorn</a>, agreed to work towards a ceasefire. The discussions were to be moderated by the British diplomat <a href="Miles%20Lampson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Killearn">Lord Killearn</a> and involved Sudirman. He took a specially commissioned train to Jakarta, departing on 20 October. However, he ordered it to return to Yogyakarta when Dutch troops refused to allow him and his men to enter the city with their weapons, feeling that such an order violated his sense of honour; the Dutch apologised, construing the events as a misunderstanding. Sudirman took another train in late October, arriving at <a href="Gambir%20Station">Gambir Station</a> in Jakarta on 1 November, where he was greeted by large crowds. The discussions in Jakarta resulted in the drafting of the <a href="Linggadjati%20Agreement">Linggadjati Agreement</a> on 15 November; the agreement was ratified on 25 March 1947, despite heavy opposition from Indonesian nationalists. Sudirman was vocally against the agreement, which he found to be detrimental to Indonesian interests, but considered himself obliged to follow his orders.

In early 1947, with the Linggadjati Agreement granting relative peace, Sudirman began work on consolidating the TKR with various "laskar". As part of a committee, Sudirman began reorganising the military; they reached an agreement in May 1947, and on 3 June 1947 the Indonesian National Armed Forces (, or TNI) was formalised; it consisted of TKR forces and various "laskar" groups, which Sudirman had included only after realising the extent of their manipulation by the political parties. However, the ceasefire obtained through the Linggadjati Agreement was not long lasting. On 21 July 1947 the Dutch forces – which had occupied areas left by the British during their withdrawal – launched <a href="Operation%20Product">Operation Product</a>, and quickly gained control of large swaths of Java and Sumatra; the national government in Yogyakarta remained untouched. Sudirman called the army to fight, using the code "Ibu Pertiwi is calling! Ibu Pertiwi is calling!", and later delivered several speeches over RRI in an unsuccessful attempt to encourage soldiers to fight against the Dutch. However, the Indonesian soldiers were unprepared and their lines crumbled quickly.
Pressured by the United Nations, which had looked at the situation in the former East Indies with disdain, on 29 August 1947 the Dutch established the <a href="Van%20Mook%20Line">Van Mook Line</a>, which divided Dutch and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called. Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, he referred to the withdrawal as a "hijrah", reminiscent of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>'s <a href="Hijra%20%28Islam%29">migration</a> to <a href="Medina">Medina</a> in 622 AD, implying that they would return. Over 35,000 troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship. This boundary was formalised by the <a href="Renville%20Agreement">Renville Agreement</a> on 17 January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister. Meanwhile, Sjarifuddin began <a href="Rationalization%20%28economics%29">rationalising</a> the army, cutting back on the number of troops. At the time the regular army consisted of 350,000 men, with a further 470,000 in the "laskar".

In this programme, by presidential decree Sudirman was no longer commander-in-chief of the military starting on 2 January 1948. He was demoted to lieutenant general, while Chief of the Air Force <a href="Soerjadi%20Soerjadarma">Soerjadi Soerjadarma</a> was intended to be commander-in-chief. Shortly afterwards, Sjarifuddin was ousted in a <a href="vote%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a> for his involvement in the Renville Agreement, and the new prime minister, <a href="Mohammad%20Hatta">Mohammad Hatta</a>, worked to implement the rationalisation programme. This led to a several months-long debate between pro- and anti-rationalisation groups. Sudirman served as a rallying point and driving force for soldiers, including numerous older commanders, who were against the programme. Sudirman was formally reinstated on 1 June 1946, upon which he effectively rescinded the command to rationalise. He chose Colonel <a href="Abdul%20Haris%20Nasution">Abdul Haris Nasution</a> as his deputy, but remained a lieutenant general.

As the rationalisation programme was winding down, Sjarifuddin began gathering soldiers from the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20Indonesia">Socialist Party</a>, <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Indonesia">Communist Party</a>, and members of the <a href="Sentral%20Organisasi%20Buruh%20Seluruh%20Indonesia">All Indonesia Centre of Labour Organizations</a> for a would-be <a href="proletarian%20revolution">proletarian revolution</a> in <a href="Madiun">Madiun</a>, <a href="East%20Java">East Java</a>, which occurred on 18 September 1948. Sudirman, ill at the time, sent Nasution to deal with the revolution; Sudirman also sent two other officers as <a href="peace%20feeler">peace feeler</a>s before the attacks. Although the revolutionary leader Muso was amenable to peace, Nasution and his soldiers had quashed the uprising by 30 September. Sudirman visited Madiun not long after the battle, later telling his wife that he had been unable to sleep there for all the bloodshed.
This rebellion, and ongoing political instability, sapped Sudirman of much of his remaining strength. On 5 October 1948, after celebrations of the military's third anniversary, Sudirman collapsed. After being examined by numerous doctors, he was diagnosed with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. At the end of the month he was brought to <a href="Panti%20Rapih%20Hospital">Panti Rapih Hospital</a> and had his right lung <a href="plombage">collapsed</a>, in hope that it would stop the spread of the disease. During his time at the hospital, he delegated most of his duties to Nasution. However, the two continued to discuss plans for the war against the Dutch, and Sudirman continued to receive status reports. They agreed that guerrilla warfare, which had been applied on raids into Dutch-held territory since May, would be best suited for their needs; towards this goal, Sudirman issued a general order on 11 November, with Nasution handling most of the preparations. Sudirman was released from the hospital on 28 November 1948.

Although he continued to issue orders, Sudirman only returned to active duty on 17 December; in light of the growing tension between the Dutch and Indonesian forces, he ordered the TNI soldiers to maintain an increased level of awareness; he also ordered large-scale military exercises as a in an unsuccessful attempt to convince the Dutch that the TNI was too strong to attack. Two days later, after a nighttime announcement that they were no longer bound by the Renville Agreement, on 19 December the Dutch launched <a href="Operation%20Kraai">Operation Kraai</a>, an attempt to capture the capital at Yogyakarta. By 07:10 local time (UTC+7), the airfield at <a href="Maguwo">Maguwo</a> had been taken by paratroopers under the command of Captain Eekhout. Sudirman, upon becoming aware of the attack, had an order read over RRI which stated that soldiers should fight as they had been trained – as guerrillas.

He then went to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the government leaders were discussing an ultimatum which stated that the city would be stormed unless the leadership accepted colonial rule. Sudirman urged that the president and vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but this suggestion was rejected. Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the <a href="Kraton%20Ngayogyakarta%20Hadiningrat">Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat</a> at the urging of Sultan <a href="Hamengkubuwana%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIX">Hamengkubuwana IX</a>, but were captured and exiled.

Sudirman first went to his official home and gathered sensitive documents, which he burned to prevent them falling into Dutch hands. His convoy, consisting of Sudirman, a small group of soldiers, and his personal doctor, then made their way south, towards Kretek, Parangtritis, <a href="Bantul">Bantul</a>. There they were received by the district head at 18:00. After several days in Kretek, during which time Sudirman sent undercover troops into the Dutch-occupied city for reconnaissance and to ask his wife for jewellery to sell and help fund the guerrilla movement, he and his group travelled east along the south coast to <a href="Wonogiri%20Regency">Wonogiri</a>. Before the Dutch attack it had already been decided that Sudirman would be able to better control the guerrillas from eastern Java, where there were still several bases. Meanwhile, Alfiah and the children were ordered to stay in the Kraton. Aware that he was being pursued by the Dutch, on 23 December Sudirman ordered his troops to continue to <a href="Ponorogo">Ponorogo</a>, where they stopped at the home of Mahfuz, a <a href="kyai">kyai</a> and <a href="ulama">Islamic religious leader</a>; Mahfuz gave the general a cane to help him walk, although Sudirman was, and continued to be, carried on a <a href="Litter%20%28vehicle%29">litter</a>. They then continued east.
Outside of <a href="Trenggalek">Trenggalek</a>, Sudirman and his group were stopped by TNI soldiers belonging to 102 Battalion. These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman – who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding them – had been taken prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in <a href="Kediri%20Regency">Kediri</a> and ordered that a car be sent to pick up the general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24 December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.

The constant Dutch attacks led Sudirman, perhaps at the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser – who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27 December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9 January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had not been present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: <a href="Supeno">Supeno</a>, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21 January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain.

Sudirman and his troops continued to make their way through the jungles and forests, eventually arriving at Sobo, near <a href="Mount%20Lawu">Mount Lawu</a>, on 18 February. During the journey, Sudirman used a radio set to convey orders to local TNI troops if he believed that the region was secure. Feeling weaker because of the physical hardships he had faced, including travelling through the forests and a lack of food, and believing the area to be safe, Sudirman decided that Sobo would serve as his guerrilla headquarters. The local commander, Lieutenant Colonel Wiliater Hutagalung, served as his go-between with the other TNI leaders. Aware that international opinion, which was beginning to condemn Dutch actions in Indonesia, could bring Indonesia greater recognition, Sudirman and Hutagalung discussed possible terms of action, before agreeing on a large-scale assault. Meanwhile, the Dutch began to spread propaganda claiming that they had captured Sudirman; this claim was intended to break the morale of the guerrillas.

Sudirman ordered Hutagalung to begin planning a full-scale assault, in which TNI soldiers – in uniform – would attack the Dutch and show their strength in front of foreign reporters and United Nations investigative teams. Hutagalung, together with officers under his commander Colonel Bambang Sugeng and government officials under Governor <a href="Wongsonegoro">Wongsonegoro</a>, spent several days discussing ways to ensure the attack could be successful. The discussion may have resulted in the <a href="General%20Offensive%20of%201%20March%201949">General Offensive of 1 March 1949</a>, which saw TNI soldiers attack Dutch outposts throughout central Java. Troops under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Suharto">Suharto</a> retook Yogyakarta for six hours before withdrawing, a successful <a href="show%20of%20force">show of force</a> which caused the Dutch to lose face internationally; they had previously declared the TNI eradicated. However, who truly ordered the offensive remains uncertain: Suharto and Hamengkubuwana IX claimed responsibility, while Bambang Sugeng's brother reportedly overheard him ordering the assault.
Under increased pressure from the United Nations, on 7 May 1949 Dutch–Indonesian negotiations resulted in the <a href="Roem%E2%80%93van%20Roijen%20Agreement">Roem–van Roijen Agreement</a>, a controversial measure which guaranteed Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta, among other points; The Dutch withdrawal commenced in late June, and the Indonesian leadership began returning to Yogyakarta from exile in early July. Sukarno ordered Sudirman to return to Yogyakarta as well, but Sudirman refused to let the Dutch withdraw without a fight; he considered the TNI to now be strong enough to defeat the dispirited Dutch. Although he was promised medicine and support in Yogyakarta, Sudirman refused to return to the political leadership, whom he considered acquiescent to the Dutch. He only agreed to return after receiving a letter, although sources disagree on its sender. On 10 July, Sudirman and his group returned to Yogyakarta, where they were greeted by thousands of civilians and warmly received by the political elite there. The reporter <a href="Rosihan%20Anwar">Rosihan Anwar</a>, who was present when the letter was delivered, wrote in 1973 that "Sudirman had to return to Yogyakarta to avoid any perceptions of a rift among the republic's top leaders".

In early August Sudirman approached Sukarno and asked him to continue the guerrilla war; Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well. As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand, and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11 August 1949.

Continuing to suffer from tuberculosis, Sudirman was checked into Panti Rapih hospital, where he stayed until October, when he was transferred to a sanatorium in nearby Pakem. As a result of his illness, Sudirman made few public appearances. Sudirman was transferred to a home in Magelang in December. In the meantime, the Indonesian and Dutch governments held a <a href="Dutch%E2%80%93Indonesian%20Round%20Table%20Conference">several-month-long conference</a> which resulted in Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty on 27 December 1949. Sudirman, despite his illness, was reconfirmed that day as commander-in-chief of the TNI, now serving the newly established <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20United%20States%20of%20Indonesia">Republic of the United States of Indonesia</a>. On 28 December, Jakarta once again became the nation's capital.
Sudirman died in Magelang at 18:30 on 29 January 1950; this was reported in a special broadcast over RRI. Upon receiving news of his death, the Sudirman family home received numerous visitors, including the entirety of the 9th Brigade, which was stationed nearby. The following morning Sudirman's body was brought to Yogyakarta. As the funeral convoy passed, led by four <a href="tank">tank</a>s and consisting of eighty motor vehicles, thousands of mourners stood at the sides of the streets. The convoy was organised by members of the 9th Brigade.

The <a href="viewing%20%28funeral%29">viewing</a>, held at the Great Mosque of Yogyakarta in the afternoon, was attended by numerous political and military elite from both Indonesia and foreign countries; this included Prime Minister <a href="Abdul%20Halim%20%28Indonesia%29">Abdul Halim</a>, Minister of Defence Hamengkubuwana IX, Minister of Health <a href="Johannes%20Leimena">Johannes Leimena</a>, Minister of Justice <a href="Abdoel%20Gaffar%20Pringgodigdo">Abdoel Gaffar Pringgodigdo</a>, Minister of Information <a href="Arnold%20Mononutu">Arnold Mononutu</a>, Chief of the Air Force Soerjadi Soerjadarma, Colonel Paku Alam VIII, and Suharto. The viewing was closed with a <a href="Three-volley%20salute">24-gun salute</a>. Sudirman's body was brought to <a href="Kusumanegara%20Heroes%27%20Cemetery">Semaki Heroes' Cemetery</a> on foot, with a crowd of mourners long trailing behind. He was interred next to Oerip, after another gun salute. His wife filled in the first scoop of dirt, followed by the government ministers. The national government ordered flags to be flown at <a href="half-mast">half-mast</a> throughout the country, and Sudirman was promoted to full general. Major-General <a href="Tahi%20Bonar%20Simatupang">Tahi Bonar Simatupang</a> was selected as the new leader of the armed forces. Sudirman's memoirs were published later that year; a series of his speeches were also published in 1970.

An obituary in the Yogyakarta-based daily "<a href="Kedaulatan%20Rakyat">Kedaulatan Rakjat</a>" wrote that Indonesia had lost a "brave and true hero". Colonel <a href="Paku%20Alam%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVIII">Paku Alam VIII</a>, in charge of the Yogyakarta area, told the national news agency <a href="Antara%20%28news%20agency%29">Antara</a> that all Indonesians, especially the armed forces, had "lost a father figure who did uncountable deeds for his country". The Indonesian Muslim leader <a href="Hamka">Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah</a>, writing soon after Sudirman's death, described the general as a "symbol of the strength of spirit shown by Indonesian heroes," while the Muslim politician <a href="Muhammad%20Isa%20Anshary">Muhammad Isa Anshary</a> described Sudirman as a "son of the revolution, as he was born in the revolution, and raised by the revolution." In a radio speech, Hatta described Sudirman as impossible to control and hard-headed, but ultimately intent on doing what was right for the country; Hatta noted that, although Sudirman often did not like the government's position, he would generally obey his orders. However, Hamengkubuwana IX noted that KNIL trained soldiers such as Abdul Haris Nasution and Tahi Bonar Simatupang were disappointed in Sudirman because of his background and poor knowledge of military techniques.

Modern opinions in Indonesia tend to be laudatory. Sardiman, a professor of history at <a href="Universitas%20Negeri%20Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta State University</a>, writes that Sudirman was as lively a speaker as Sukarno, who was known for his fiery speeches, and a devoted, incorruptible leader. The Indonesian historian and former Minister of Education and Culture <a href="Nugroho%20Notosusanto">Nugroho Notosusanto</a> described Sudirman as "his only idol", citing the general's guerrilla period as the origin of the army's "<a href="esprit%20de%20corps">esprit de corps</a>". The general's guerrilla campaign is emphasised in biographies of him because, during that period, the army had a greater role than the exiled political leadership; beginning in the 1970s, all military cadets had to retrace the long route prior to graduation, a "pilgrimage" meant to instill a sense of struggle. Sudirman's grave is also a <a href="ziyarat">pilgrimage</a> destination, both for the military and general public. According to Katharine McGregor of the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, the Indonesian military has elevated Sudirman to a saint-like status.

Sudirman received numerous <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Indonesia">awards from the national government</a> posthumously, including the Bintang Sakti, Bintang Gerilya, Bintang Mahaputera Adipurna, Bintang Mahaputera Pratama, Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipurna, and Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipradana. On 10 December 1964 Sudirman was declared a <a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Indonesia">National Hero of Indonesia</a> by Presidential Decree 314 of 1964. Oerip was declared a National Hero by the same decree. He was posthumously promoted to <a href="Jenderal%20Besar">General of the Army</a> in 1997.
According to McGregor, the military increasingly used Sudirman's image as a symbol of leadership as it gained more political power. An image of Sudirman was featured on every denomination of the 1968 series of <a href="Indonesian%20rupiah">rupiah</a>. He featured as a major character in several war films, including "<a href="Janur%20Kuning">Janur Kuning</a>" ("Yellow Coconut Leaf"; 1979) and "<a href="Serangan%20Fajar">Serangan Fajar</a>" ("Dawn Attack"; 1982).

Numerous museums have been dedicated to Sudirman. His childhood home in <a href="Purbalingga">Purbalingga</a> is now the Sudirman Museum, while his official home in Yogyakarta is now the Sasmitaloka Museum to General Sudirman. The house in Magelang where he died is also now the Sudirman Museum, established on 18 May 1967 and containing artefacts belonging to the general. Other museums, including the <a href="Monument%20Yogya%20Kembali">Monument Yogya Kembali</a> in Yogyakarta and the <a href="Satriamandala%20Museum">Satriamandala Museum</a> in Jakarta have rooms dedicated to him. Numerous streets are named after Sudirman, including a major street in Jakarta; McGregor states that nearly every city in the country has a General Sudirman Street. Statues and monuments to him are spread throughout the archipelago, most of which were built after 1970. <a href="Jenderal%20Soedirman%20University">Jenderal Soedirman University</a> in Banyumas, established in 1963, is named after him.

Pennsylvania-class battleship

The "Pennsylvania"-class consisted of two <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s built for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> just before the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. The ships were named and , after the American states of the same names. They constituted the United States' second battleship design to adhere to the "<a href="all%20or%20nothing%20%28armor%29">all or nothing</a>" armor scheme, and were the newest American <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s when the United States entered the First World War.

The s represented a marked increase in the United States' dreadnought technology, and the "Pennsylvania"-class was intended to continue this with slight increases in the ships' capabilities, including two additional <a href="14%26quot%3B/45%20caliber%20gun">/45 caliber guns</a> and improved underwater protection. The class was the second <a href="standard%20type%20battleship">standard type</a> battleship class to join the US Navy, along with the preceding "Nevada" and the succeeding , and classes.

In service, the "Pennsylvania"-class saw limited use in the First World War, as a shortage of <a href="fuel%20oil">oil fuel</a> in the United Kingdom meant that only the coal-burning ships of <a href="United%20States%20Battleship%20Division%20Nine%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Battleship Division Nine</a> were sent. Both were sent across the Atlantic to France after the war for the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference of 1919</a>, and were then transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a> before being significantly modernized from 1929 to 1931. For the remainder of the inter-war period, the ships were used in exercises and <a href="fleet%20problem">fleet problem</a>s. Both "Pennsylvania" and "Arizona" were present during the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, which brought the United States into the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. "Arizona" was sunk by a <a href="USS%20Arizona%20%28BB-39%29%23Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">massive magazine explosion</a> and was turned into <a href="USS%20Arizona%20Memorial">a memorial</a> after the war, while "Pennsylvania", in <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> at the time, received only minor damage. After a refit from October 1942 to February 1943, "Pennsylvania" went on to serve as a <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a> ship for most of the remainder of the war. "Pennsylvania" was present at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf%23Battle%20of%20Surigao%20Strait%20%2825%20October%29">Battle of Surigao Strait</a>, the last battle ever between battleships, but did not engage. "Pennsylvania" was severely damaged by a <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> on 12 August 1945, two days before the cessation of hostilities. With minimal repairs, it was used in <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation "Crossroads"</a>, part of the <a href="nuclear%20testing%20at%20Bikini%20Atoll">nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll</a>, before being expended as a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> in 1948.

The preceding "Nevada"-class battleships represented a leap forward from previous American battleship technology and from most contemporary foreign designs. They were the first in the world to employ the "<a href="all%20or%20nothing%20%28armor%29">all or nothing</a>" armor scheme that characterized every succeeding American battleship. Devised with the knowledge that engagement ranges between battle fleets was growing greater as <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> sizes increased, the system moved away from previous designs that used heavy, medium, and light armor, in favor of using only heavy armor to protect vital areas on the ship. The new system envisioned that, at long ranges, ships would be attacked with only <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armor-piercing</a> (AP) projectiles, stoppable only by heavy armor. Medium or light armor would only serve to detonate the shells. By removing gun turrets and reducing the overall protected length of the ship, the navy's designers were able to devote the weight savings to the <a href="belt%20armor">belt</a>, as well as extra <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck armor</a> to protect against plunging shells.

In issuing desired specifications for the design that would become the "Nevada"-class, the Navy's <a href="General%20Board%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">General Board</a> asked for triple gun turrets, "i.e.", three guns mounted per turret. They were very unsatisfied with the awkward placement required on classes preceding the "Nevada"s, which had five and six two-gun turrets—yet moving back to the four two-gun turrets of the would be a significant loss in firepower. Although a triple turret was first proposed in American professional magazines in 1901 and briefly considered for the "South Carolina"s, it was not even in the experimental stage—the first turret was authorized in 1911 and would not be ready until months after contracts for the new ships would be signed with the shipbuilders. The decision to go ahead with the turret was a calculated gamble, but proved to be a qualified success; the only issue came with <a href="Aerodynamics">shell interference</a> when the center and outside guns were fired simultaneously, which was easily solved by delaying the firing of the center barrel by a small fraction of a second. Moreover, there was a major benefit in weight thanks to the accompanying loss of an armored <a href="barbette">barbette</a> and turret. These weight savings were applied to the armor protection, making the "all or nothing" concept a reality.

The "Nevada"s were also the first American battleships to use exclusively <a href="fuel%20oil">oil fuel</a>, which had greater thermal efficiency than firing with <a href="coal">coal</a> or coal sprayed with oil. The cumulative effect of the change was measured by the navy as a fifty-five percent increase in steam production per pound of fuel (in a design for an oil-fired version of the ). This would give oil-fired vessels additional range, an important consideration for ships based in the Pacific, but the Navy's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a> (C&R) pointed out what it saw as the unfortunate side effects, including a lower <a href="center%20of%20gravity">center of gravity</a>, higher <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a>, and the loss of coal bunkers, which were employed as part of the armor protection. Within a few years oil tanks below the waterline were considered indispensable parts of the underwater armor scheme employed in American dreadnoughts.

The General Board's call for a new 1913 <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> battleship design was sent in June 1911 with the recent "Nevada" innovations in mind. They desired a ship with a main battery of twelve 14-inch guns in triple turrets, a secondary battery of twenty-two guns, a speed of , and armor equivalent to that of the "Nevada"s. <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">C&R</a>'s first sketch was unsatisfactory; their lengthy design of and actually had less armor than the "Nevada"s, with a belt.

The design process was marked by various efforts to meet the General Board's specifications with only a moderate increase in tonnage over the "Nevada"-class. Between January and March 1912, thirteen sketches were prepared for consideration by C&R with reciprocating or turbine engines that traded either speed or <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> for armor. Some later designs gave up a half <a href="knot%28unit%29">knot</a> of speed to free up about , enough to thicken the belt from and the <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s to 14 inches. The choice between double or triple turrets was also still an issue, as the "Nevada"-class had not been completed yet. The <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a> was in favor of waiting for test results, rather than risking reverting to two-gun 14-inch turrets or moving up to two-gun 16-inch turrets.

In March 1912, C&R proposed their seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth designs to the General Board for approval. The eighth and ninth designs were the ones to give up a half knot of speed, while the tenth was a design with four triple turrets and lighter than the "Nevada"-class ships. In April, the General Board chose the seventh design, which satisfied all of their requirements, albeit on the largest displacement, . The length was fixed at , the beam at , and the draft at . <a href="Steam%20turbine">Steam turbine</a>s gave the design and 21 knots, while the main armor belt was 13.5 inches tapering to at the ends. This design was further refined and emerged in a completed state in September. The delay was partially due to tests on the proposed armor, which were completed in June 1912 and resulted in significant alterations to the "Pennsylvania"-class' underwater protection.

The "Pennsylvania"-class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors, the "Nevada"-class. They had a <a href="waterline%20length">waterline length</a> of , an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of (at the <a href="waterline">waterline</a>), and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. This was longer than the older ships. Its designed <a href="standard%20displacement">standard</a> and full load displacements were and , respectively, but they actually displaced standard and at full load, over more than the older ships. The class had a metacentric height of at full load.

The ships had four <a href="direct%20drive">direct drive</a> <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> steam turbine sets with geared cruising turbines, each of which drove a propeller in diameter. They were powered by twelve <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox">Babcock & Wilcox</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , but only achieved during "Pennsylvania"s sea trials, when it slightly exceeded its designed speed of . "Pennsylvania" reached during full-power trials in 1916, and "Arizona" reached in September 1924. The class was designed to normally carry of fuel oil, but had a maximum capacity of . At full capacity, they could steam at a speed of for an estimated ; this could be extended to with a <a href="%3Awikt%3Afoul%23Adjective">clean bottom</a>. They had four <a href="turbo%20generator">turbo generator</a>s.

The "Pennsylvania"-class carried twelve 14-inch/45 <a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> guns in triple <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s. The guns could not elevate independently and were limited to a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a maximum range of . The ships carried 100 shells for each gun. Defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s was provided by twenty-two <a href="5%26quot%3B/51%20caliber%20gun">5-inch/51 caliber guns</a> mounted in individual <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s in the sides of the hull; these proved vulnerable to sea spray and could not be worked in heavy seas. At an elevation of 15°, they had a maximum range of . Each gun was provided with 230 rounds of ammunition. The ships mounted four <a href="3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun">/50 caliber</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20guns">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a>, although only two were fitted when completed. The other pair were added shortly afterward on top of Turret III. The class also mounted two submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s and carried 24 <a href="Bliss-Leavitt%20Mark%203%20torpedo">Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo</a>es for them.

The "Pennsylvania"-class design continued the all-or-nothing principle of armoring only the most important areas of the battleships, which began in the preceding "Nevada"-class. The waterline armor belt of <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a> measured 13.5 inches thick and only covered the class' machinery spaces and <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>. It had a total height of , of which was below the waterline; beginning below the waterline, the belt tapered to its minimum thickness of 8 inches. The transverse <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a> at each end of the ships ranged from 13 to 8 inches in thickness. The faces of the gun turrets were thick while the sides were thick and the turret roofs were protected by 5 inches of armor. The armor of the barbettes was thick. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was protected by of armor and had a roof eight inches thick.

The main armor deck was three plates thick with a total thickness of 3 inches; over the steering gear the armor increased to in two plates. Beneath it was the splinter deck that ranged from in thickness. The boiler uptakes were protected by a conical <a href="mantlet">mantlet</a> that ranged from in thickness. A 3-inch torpedo bulkhead was placed inboard from the side, and the class was provided with a complete <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a>. Testing in mid-1914 revealed that this system could withstand of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a>.
The authorization for the two "Pennsylvania"-class ships faced political opposition for being too weak and expensive. Senator <a href="Benjamin%20Tillman">Benjamin Tillman</a> believed that a much more capable warship was needed because of the shocking increase in battleship size over the previous few years—between 1907 (the ) and 1912, the displacement of American battleships increased by about fifty percent, from around to 30,000 long tons. Tillman proposed a "maximum battleship" in a Senate <a href="resolution%20%28law%29">resolution</a> in July 1912, which was adopted unanimously:

"Resolved": That the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Committee on Naval Affairs</a> [is] instructed to investigate and report to the Senate ... the object being to find out from official sources the maximum size and maximum draft, the maximum armament, and the maximum armor to make the best battleship or <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> the world has ever seen or ever will see; to have this country own the greatest marine engine of war ever constructed or ever to be constructed under known conditions; and to report whether one such overpowering vessel would not in its judgement be better for this country to build than to continue by increasing taxation to spend the millions and millions of dollars now in prospect in the race for naval supremacy. ... Let us leave some money in the Treasury for other more necessary and useful expenditures, such as good roads, controlling the floods in the <a href="Mississippi%20River%23Watershed">Mississippi</a>, draining swamp land in the South, and irrigating the arid land in the West. (S 361, <a href="62nd%20United%20States%20Congress">62nd Cong.</a>, 2nd sess.)

Tillman's proposal was, in his own words, treated as a "joke"; the "<a href="World%20Affairs">Advocate of Peace</a>" stated that "it is nearly impossible to read this ... without having an inextinguishable bout of laughter." Still, C&R completed multiple studies of a maximum battleship constrained only by technological limitations. The first design submitted by C&R was a severely enlarged "Nevada", or a ship with twelve 14-inch guns, belt armor, and a maximum speed of for a price of $19.5 million. A later sketch dropped the speed to to see the effect on displacement and cost, which it dropped to and $17 million, respectively, and the consequent shortening of the ship would allow it to enter the <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a>s in <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">New York</a> and <a href="Norfolk%20Naval%20Yard">Norfolk</a>. Tillman was concerned with this speed, and another study increased the speed to , trading it for four guns, or one-third of the main battery, and much of the armor.

Political opposition in Congress also made it difficult to build the "Pennsylvania"-class. The <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become "Pennsylvania" was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; <a href="open%20tender">bids were opened</a> on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, <a href="Newport%20News%20Shipbuilding">Newport News</a>, on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).
"Arizona" was the one approved battleship for the fiscal year 1914. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="George%20von%20Lengerke%20Meyer">George von Lengerke Meyer</a> had requested three battleships for that fiscal year, citing the former policy of building two per year, plus an additional ship to make up for authorizing only "Pennsylvania" in the previous year, but congressional compromises once again approved only one new battleship. "Arizona" was authorized on 4 March 1913, but to avoid a lengthy delay between the two, the ship was ordered much more quickly, on 24 June, by giving the contract to a navy-owned shipyard.

"Pennsylvania" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 27 October 1913, with goals of fourteen months until <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launch</a>, and thirty-two until completion. The as-yet unnamed "Arizona" was laid down on the morning of 16 March 1914 with <a href="Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Assistant Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> in attendance, and the builders intended to set a world-record ten months between keel-laying and launch, These ambitious goals—"Pennsylvania"s anticipated completion date was a full two months earlier than the American record—were set by Navy Secretary <a href="Josephus%20Daniels">Josephus Daniels</a>, who wanted the United States to compete with <a href="Royal%20Navy">British</a> and <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">German</a> building achievements.

The constructors were not able not meet these goals, though. "Pennsylvania" was launched on 16 March 1915—seventeen months from keel-laying to launch, and just over two-thirds complete—while "Arizona" was launched on 19 June 1915, about fifteen months after keel laying. "Arizona" weighed at launch. <a href="Movie%20camera">Movie camera</a>s were used to film the launch, in order to provide data for future launches. After their launch, both ships went through the necessary <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> period and <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s. On "Pennsylvania"s trials, the ship attained a top speed of , averaged , and was also able to steam for twelve hours at in winds. These attributes pleased the Navy's <a href="Board%20of%20Inspection%20and%20Survey">Board of Inspection</a>, but "Scientific American" lamented the ship's low speed compared to the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Italian</a> s, <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Russian</a> s, and British s, which they (somewhat inaccurately) stated had top speeds of 22.5, 23, and 25 knots, respectively. "Pennsylvania" was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 12 June 1916, its sister ship followed on 17 October 1916.

"Pennsylvania" and "Arizona" were commissioned during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, but prior to the <a href="American%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I">United States' entry</a> on the side of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a>. During their first year, the ships were cleaned and readied for full active duty. "Pennsylvania" became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Atlantic Fleet on 12 October 1916. "Arizona" first fired its main guns on 23 December, but issues with the propulsion system, specifically a stripped turbine, kept the ship almost exclusively in the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">New York Navy Yard</a> from December 1916 to March 1917. Both ships were based in the United States for the duration of the war, owing to a shortage of fuel oil in the United Kingdom, and only the coal-burning battleships of <a href="United%20States%20Battleship%20Division%20Nine%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Battleship Division Nine</a> were sent. After the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">armistice</a> in 1918, both "Pennsylvania"-class battleships were sent to the other side of the Atlantic. "Arizona" was sent first, leaving on 18 November and arriving in Portsmouth on the 30th. "Pennsylvania" escorted the American President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>'s transport, , across the Atlantic for the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a> in 1919. In 1921 and 1922, during the <a href="inter-war%20period">inter-war period</a>, both ships took part in a mission to Peru and were transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a>.

"Pennsylvania" and "Arizona" were given extensive modernizations from 1929 through 1931; the expenditure came in the fiscal year 1930. As part of the rebuilding, "Pennsylvania", which had been designed as a fleet flagship, had its conning tower expanded. Aside from that, "Pennsylvania" and "Arizona" received similar treatment: the elevation of the main batteries was increased to °, new fire control systems on <a href="tripod%20mast">tripod mast</a>s were added, the secondary armament and directors were replaced and overhauled, eight <a href="5%26quot%3B/25%20caliber%20gun">5-inch/25 caliber</a> anti-aircraft guns (four per side) were mounted on the weather deck which was above the secondary anti-ship 5-inch gun battery, and their bridges were enlarged to hold elevated anti-aircraft directors. Armor additions were comparatively minimal beyond <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a>s, which were standard additions on all major warships in this period: of armor were added to the second <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">armored deck</a>, and a <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a> was added to the engine room. The propulsion system of the two "Pennsylvania"s received perhaps the most attention. The boiler system was entirely replaced with six small-tube boilers and new turbines, the latter partially from the canceled battleship . The new machinery allowed the ships to come close to their old design speed of , even with the added bulk of bulges: "Pennsylvania" made 20.89 knots and "Arizona" 20.7 knots on full-power trials.

After their modernization, both ships participated in the normal activities of the fleet, including <a href="fleet%20problem">fleet problem</a> exercises, and then joined the entire Pacific Fleet in their new base in <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, after the beginning of the Second World War in Europe. Two years later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> sank "Arizona" in a tremendous explosion and slightly damaged "Pennsylvania", which was in dry dock at the time. "Arizona"s wreck was later <a href="USS%20Arizona%20%28BB-39%29%23Salvage%20and%20memorial">partly salvaged and is now a war memorial</a>.

"Pennsylvania" came back into service more quickly than many of the other battleships present during the attack; it left on 20 December and was under repair in <a href="San%20Francisco%20Naval%20Shipyard">San Francisco</a> until 30 March 1942. For the next several months, "Pennsylvania" was stationed on the United States' <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>, before being reassigned to Pearl Harbor as the fleet flagship for a short time (August to October). After another refit in San Francisco, which lasted until February 1943, the ship was sent to assist American forces engaged in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">Aleutian Islands Campaign</a>. During this time, "Pennsylvania" was nearly hit by a torpedo from , which was later sunk.

For the next year, "Pennsylvania" provided shore bombardment during the Battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Makin">Makin</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Saipan">Saipan</a>, along with the <a href="Mariana%20and%20Palau%20Islands%20campaign">Palau Islands Campaign</a>. The ship also participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte">landings on Leyte</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>. During this time, "Pennsylvania" was present at the last battle ever between battleships, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf%23The%20Battle%20of%20Surigao%20Strait%20%2825%20October%29">Battle of Surigao Strait</a>. The ship did not fire any salvos because the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Japanese</a> vessels were turned away or sunk at long range, beyond "Pennsylvania"s outdated fire control but within range of other, radar-directed battleships.
In 1945, "Pennsylvania" was sent for another refit in San Francisco, and the guns in its main battery, worn out from the frequent shore bombardments, were replaced by those from "Nevada" and . After its completion in July, the ship <a href="Wake%20Island%23Japanese%20occupation%20and%20surrender">bombarded Wake Island</a> on 1 August en route to <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, where it was struck by an air-dropped torpedo. It hit near the starboard propeller shaft, killing twenty men and knocking out three of the ship's four shafts. This area was vital, and the opened seals around the shafts led to large amounts of flooding that nearly sank the battleship. "Pennsylvania" was towed to shallower waters, where local repairs were made. The ship's last action was to fire at a "<a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a>" on 13 August; it was then towed to <a href="Guam">Guam</a> beginning on the 18th, where temporary repairs were effected, before being sent to <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Naval%20Shipyard%20and%20Intermediate%20Maintenance%20Facility">Navy Yard Puget Sound</a> for more permanent repairs. "Pennsylvania" arrived on 24 October only after a torturous journey, which saw the ship lose all but one of its remaining propeller shafts again while taking on water through the temporary patch put over the torpedo hole in Guam.

With the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Japanese surrender</a> on 2 September, the Puget Sound repairs were limited to those necessary to ensure "Pennsylvania"s delivery to <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> for <a href="Bikini%20atomic%20experiments">atomic experiments</a> in July 1946. The old battleship survived the tests, but was decommissioned on 29 August and used for <a href="radiation">radiological</a> studies before being sunk as a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> on 10 February 1948. "Pennsylvania" was struck from the <a href="Navy%20Vessel%20Register">Navy Vessel Register</a> nine days later.

Inocybe saliceticola

Inocybe saliceticola is a fungus found in moist habitats in the <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a>. The species produces brown <a href="mushrooms">mushrooms</a> with <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> of varying shapes up to across, and tall, thin <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> up to long. At the base of the stem is a large and well-defined "bulb". The species produces unusually shaped, irregular <a href="spore">spore</a>s, each with a few thick protrusions. This feature helps differentiate it from other species that would otherwise be similar in appearance and <a href="habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>.

"Inocybe saliceticola" grows in <a href="mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal</a> association with <a href="willow">willow</a> trees, and it is for this that the species is named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include <a href="beech">beech</a> and <a href="alder">alder</a> taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among mosses or <a href="detritus">detritus</a>. "I. saliceticola" was first described in 2009, and within the genus "Inocybe", the species is a part of the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Marginatae". The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.

"Inocybe saliceticola" was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 2009 by Jukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen in the journal "<a href="Karstenia%20%28journal%29">Karstenia</a>", based on around 20 specimens from Finland, the majority of which were collected by the authors. The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> was collected from the shore of lake <a href="Pahakala">Pahakala</a>, near <a href="Nurmes">Nurmes</a>. The <a href="Botanical%20name">specific name</a> "saliceticola" is in reference to the fact that the species grows among <a href="willow">willow</a> ("Salix"). Within the genus "<a href="Inocybe">Inocybe</a>", "I. saliceticola" belongs to the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Marginatae", as defined by <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>. The section has been defined in several ways. It was established in 1933 by <a href="Robert%20K%C3%BChner">Robert Kühner</a>, who identified two key characteristics: a <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> which does not feature a cortina (a fragile, cobweb-like <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a>) but is entirely covered by <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a>, and the presence of a <a href="wikt%3Amarginate">marginate</a> "bulb" at the base of the stem. Singer emended the section in 1986 to take into account that a bulb is not always present. A slightly different infrageneric taxonomy was offered by Thom Kuyper in 1986. He, like Singer, grouped "Marginatae" under "Inocybe" <a href="subgenus">subg.</a> "Inocybe", but he labelled it a "supersection". However, phylogenetic studies have indicated that neither Singer's section "Marginatae" nor Kuyper's "supersection" "Marginatae" truly form <a href="monophyletic%20groups">monophyletic groups</a>, but that Singer's section comes closer to doing so. Species within "Marginatae" similar to "I. saliceticola" include "<a href="Inocybe%20obtusiuscula">I. obtusiuscula</a>", "<a href="Inocybe%20dunensis">I. dunensis</a>", "<a href="Inocybe%20salicis-herbaceae">I. salicis-herbaceae</a>", "<a href="Inocybe%20substellata">I. substellata</a>", "<a href="Inocybe%20praetervisa">I. praetervisa</a>", "<a href="Inocybe%20salicis">I. salicis</a>" and "<a href="Inocybe%20mixtilis">I. mixtilis</a>". These species are all known to associate with willow, and all have macroscopic similarities.

"Incoybe saliceticola" produces <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s with <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>s of between in diameter. The shape of the cap varies, depending on the age of the mushroom. In younger specimens, they are conical or nearly so, but as the mushroom matures, the caps flatten into a more convex or flat shape. As such, the height of the cap varies from . The cap features an <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a> that is usually very prominent. Around the umbo, the cap surface is smooth, but towards the cap margin, the surface is defined by <a href="fibrils">fibrils</a> running from the margin towards the umbo. The cap sometimes splits along these. The cap's colour varies from yellow-brown to pale brown, and is palest at the margins. The umbo contrasts to this somewhat, being a grey-brown or red-brown. The slender <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> measures from long by thick. It thickens slightly towards the base, where it joins a large, well-defined "bulb" that can be up to across. Shallow grooves run up the surface of the stem, which is covered in a fine white powder. In one case, however, an atypical specimen was recovered with an almost completely smooth stem, free of striations or powder. The stem varies in colour, with whitish, pale yellow-brown, pale red-brown, pale brown and grey-brown all observed, while the base is white. No <a href="Partial%20veil">veil</a> or <a href="Annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> is visible.

The fairly crowded <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are adnate, meaning that they attach to the stem through their entire depth. They are a pale grey to pale grey-brown when young, darkening to grey-brown as they mature. The gill edges, which are slightly <a href="wiktionary%3Afimbriate">fimbriate</a>, are the same colour or paler. The <a href="Context%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> lacks any strong or distinctive smell or taste, and is described in the original description as "fungoid". In the cap, the flesh varies in colour from whitish to a pale brown-grey or pale yellow, while in the stem, it is the same colour as the stem surface or slightly paler.

The irregularly shaped <a href="spore">spore</a>s measure from 7.2 to 11.6 by 5.1 to 7.9 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s (μm), each featuring a few thick protusions. Abnormal spores of a different shape, sometimes with protrusions more distinct from the actual spore than is typical, can sometimes form; this is perhaps due to poor weather. The club-shaped <a href="basidia">basidia</a> measure 25 to 40 by 9 to 14 μm, and each basidium bears four spores. The yellowish pleurocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on the face of the gill) are <a href="ventricose">ventricose</a> or occasionally club-shaped, measuring 41 to 89 by 12 to 23 μm, including a <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> up to 4.5 μm thick. The tip often bends and is encrusted with crystal-like structures, while the base tapers, or narrows into a small stalk. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are much the same, but they are typically somewhat shorter and stouter. The longer caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) occur all the way down the stem and measure up to 99 μm in length with a more variable shape. The mushrooms also feature "paracystidia", club-shaped cystidia-like structures on the gills lacking crystals, as well as "cauloparacystidia" on the stem. In "Inocybe saliceticola", the paracystidia are fairly abundant, with thin cell-walls, while the abundant cauloparacystidia can have slightly thicker walls and are often arranged in clusters.

Of the species of "Marginatae" associated with willow, five ("I. salicis-herbaceae", "I. substellata", "I. praetervisa", "I. salicis" and "I. mixtilis") can be readily distinguished from "I. saliceticola" as their spores feature distinct, strongly protruding excrescences. In addition, they are found in vastly different habitats: "I. mixtilis" and "I. praetervisa" favour willow only in <a href="montane">montane</a> habitats, while "I. salicis-herbaceae" and "I. substellata" grow exclusively in montane habitats. "I. salicis" is rare in Nordic countries, and is typically collected from <a href="dunes">dunes</a>. Of the other two listed by Vauras and Kokkonen, the spores of "I. dunensis" are distinctly larger and of a different shape to those of "I. saliceticola", and the cystidia are shorter. While the species is typically found on the beach, it grows on fine sand, and has not been recorded in Finland. "I. obtusiuscula" also has larger spores of a different shape, and they are a darker colour, owing to their thick cell walls. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Phylogenetic analysis</a> of the respective <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> sequences has confirmed that "I. obtusiuscula" and "I. saliceticola" are separate species.

"<a href="Inocybe%20alnea">Inocybe alnea</a>" and "<a href="Inocybe%20ochracea">I. ochracea</a>", regarded by some as the same species, can also be distinguished from "I. saliceticola" by the presence of protruding nodules on the spores. DNA analysis confirmed that they were separate from "I. saliceticola", and, in any case, it is possible that they do not grow in association with willow. "<a href="Inocybe%20hirculus">I. hirculus</a>" has been recorded growing near "I. saliceticola", but can be differentiated both macroscopically and microscopically; the mushrooms of "I. hirculus" have a much more <a href="wikt%3Afibrillose">fibrillose</a> cap, and the stem does not join a bulb, while the spores are larger. Macroscopically, "<a href="Inocybe%20rivularis">I. rivularis</a>", which could grow in similar habitats to that of "I. saliceticola", produces larger mushrooms and has powder only towards the top of the stem. It also differs microscopically.

"Inocybe saliceticola" grows in a <a href="mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal</a> association with willow ("Salix"). Precise favoured species are unclear; at least one of the <a href="Salix%20phylicifolia">tea-leaved willow</a> ("Salix phylicifolia") or the <a href="Salix%20myrsinifolia">dark-leaved willow</a> ("S. myrsinifolia") is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the <a href="Salix%20pentandra">bay willow</a> ("S. pentandra"), the <a href="Salix%20cinnerea">grey willow</a> ("S. cinnerea"), the <a href="Alnus%20incana">grey alder</a> ("Alnus incana") and species of <a href="birch">birch</a> ("Betula"). "I. saliceticola" is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from <a href="detritus">detritus</a> or amongst moss, such as the <a href="Calliergon%20cordifolium">heart-leaved spear-moss</a> ("Calliergon cordifolium"), the <a href="Sphagnum%20squarrosum">spiky-bog moss</a> ("Sphagnum squarrosum") and species of "<a href="Mnium">Mnium</a>". They are typically near plants such as the <a href="Lysimachia%20thyrsiflora">tufted loosestrife</a> ("Lysimachia thyrsiflora"), the <a href="Ranunculus%20repens">creeping buttercup</a> ("Ranunculus repens"), the <a href="Galium%20palustre">common marsh-bedstraw</a> ("Galium palustre"), the <a href="Comarum%20palustre">purple marshlocks</a> ("Comarum palustre") and the <a href="Calamagrostis%20canescens">purple small-reed</a> ("Calamagrostis canescens"), and share the habitat with other "Inocybe", including "<a href="Inocybe%20acuta">I. acuta</a>" and <a href="Inocybe%20lacera%20var.%20helobia">"I. lacera" var. "helobia"</a>.

"Inocybe saliceticola" has been recorded in several locations around Finland, ranging from the <a href="hemiboreal">hemiboreal</a> zones in the east and the south of the country, to <a href="Boreal%20ecosystem">boreal</a> areas in the north, and it has also been found in Sweden, close to the <a href="Klar%C3%A4lven">Klarälven</a>. At least in <a href="North%20Karelia">North Karelia</a>, Finland, it is relatively common in the right habitats. It is one of over 150 species of "Inocybe" found in the <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a>, and fruit bodies can be encountered between late July and early October.

Debora Green

Debora Green (née Jones; born February 28, 1951) is an American <a href="physician">physician</a> who pleaded <a href="no%20contest">no contest</a> to setting a 1995 fire which <a href="arson">burned down</a> her family's home and killed two of her children, and to poisoning her husband with <a href="ricin">ricin</a> with the intention of causing his death. The case was sensational, and covered heavily by news media, especially in the <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>–<a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> area, where the crimes occurred. Though Green has petitioned for a new trial twice in recent years, her requests have not been successful.

Green married Michael Farrar in 1979 while practicing as an <a href="emergency%20medicine">emergency physician</a>. The marriage was tumultuous, and Farrar filed for divorce in July 1995. Between August and September 1995, Farrar repeatedly fell violently ill, and despite numerous hospitalizations his doctors could not pinpoint the source of his illness. Green's emotional stability deteriorated and she began to drink heavily, even while supervising her children. On October 24, 1995, the Farrar family home, occupied by Green and the couple's three children, caught fire. Kate Farrar and Debora Green escaped without harm, but despite the efforts of firefighters, Timothy and Kelly Farrar died in the blaze. Investigation showed that trails of accelerant in the house led back to Green's bedroom, and that the source of Michael Farrar's intractable illness had been ricin, a poison served to him in his food by Green.

Upon her arrest on November 22, 1995, Green was charged with two counts of <a href="first-degree%20murder%20%28United%20States%20law%29">first-degree murder</a>, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. She was held on $3,000,000 <a href="bail">bail</a>—the highest ever required by <a href="Johnson%20County%2C%20Kansas">Johnson County, Kansas</a>—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a <a href="order%20to%20show%20cause">show cause hearing</a>. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an <a href="Alford%20plea">Alford plea</a> to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a>ing by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied by a judge, claimed that the evidence used to convict her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.

Green was born February 28, 1951, the second of two daughters to Joan and Bob Jones of <a href="Havana%2C%20Illinois">Havana, Illinois</a>. She showed early intellectual promise, and is reported to have taught herself to read and write before she was three years old. Green participated in a number of school activities at the two high schools she attended and was a <a href="National%20Merit%20Scholar">National Merit Scholar</a> and co-valedictorian of her high school class. Those who knew her at the time later described her as "[fitting] right in" and someone who was "going to be successful".

Green attended the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois">University of Illinois</a> from the fall of 1969, where she took a <a href="Academic%20major">major</a> in <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>. Though she had intended to pursue <a href="chemical%20engineering">chemical engineering</a> as a career, she opted to attend medical school after graduating in 1972, believing the market was flooded with engineers. She attended the <a href="University%20of%20Kansas%20School%20of%20Medicine">University of Kansas School of Medicine</a> from 1972 to her graduation in 1975. Green chose <a href="emergency%20medicine">emergency medicine</a> as her initial specialty and undertook a residency in the <a href="Truman%20Medical%20Center-Hospital%20Hill">Truman Medical Center</a> Emergency Room after her graduation from medical school.

Throughout her undergraduate and medical school attendance, she dated Duane M. J. Green, an engineer. The couple married while she was studying at the University of Kansas. The couple lived together in <a href="Independence%2C%20Missouri">Independence, Missouri</a>, while Debora finished her residency, but by 1978 they had separated and then divorced. Debora cited basic incompatibility as the reason for the divorce—"[...W]e had absolutely no common interests", she was later quoted as saying—but the divorce was friendly.

During the period the Greens were separated, Debora met Michael Farrar, a student in his twenties completing his last year of medical school. Farrar was struck by Green's intelligence and vitality, though he was embarrassed by her habit of explosively losing her temper at minor slights. In contrast, Green felt that Farrar was a stable, dependable presence. The couple were married on May 26, 1979. When Farrar was accepted for an <a href="internal%20medicine">internal medicine</a> residency at the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a>, the couple moved to <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>. Green went into practice at <a href="Jewish%20Hospital%20%28Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio%29">Jewish Hospital</a> as an emergency physician, but grew dissatisfied and eventually switched specialties. She began a second residency in internal medicine, joining Farrar's program.

By the early 1980s, the Farrars were living in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. During this time Green suffered a number of medical issues, including surgery on an infected wrist, cerebellar <a href="migraine">migraine</a>s, and <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>. The Farrars' first child, Timothy, was born on January 20, 1982. After a six-week <a href="maternity%20leave">maternity leave</a>, Green returned to her <a href="Fellowship%20%28medicine%29">fellowship</a> in <a href="hematology">hematology</a> and <a href="oncology">oncology</a> at the University of Cincinnati.

Two years later, a second child, Kate, was born. Green again returned to her studies after maternity leave, and by 1985 had completed her fellowship. She went into private practice in hematology and oncology while Farrar finished the last year of his cardiology fellowship. Later Green and Farrar both joined established medical practices in the <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, area. After a year, Green started her own private practice, which prospered until she became pregnant and took time off work for another maternity leave. The couple's third child, Kelly, was born on December 13, 1988.

As the Farrar children grew old enough, they were enrolled in <a href="The%20Pembroke%20Hill%20School">The Pembroke Hill School</a>, a private school in Kansas City. Green was reportedly a good mother who wanted the best for her children and encouraged them in their activities of choice. Though she attempted to resume her medical career after her last maternity leave, her practice faltered and her chronic pain increased. In 1992, she gave up her practice and became a homemaker, working part-time from the family's house on medical <a href="peer%20review">peer review</a>s and <a href="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> processing. Medical professionals who worked with her during this time described her as being distant and cold towards her patients and displaying obsessive behavior towards her husband.

Farrar later alleged that Green had been self-medicating with <a href="sedatives">sedatives</a> and <a href="narcotics">narcotics</a> to treat pain from infections and injuries periodically throughout their marriage. He recounted several episodes to author <a href="Ann%20Rule">Ann Rule</a> in which he had confronted Green with issues regarding her demeanor, handwriting, and speech patterns which indicated drug intoxication, and said that Green had agreed to stop using the medications each time he confronted her.

The Farrar children were all engaged in activities outside the home. Timothy played both <a href="soccer">soccer</a> and <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a>, while Kate was a ballerina with the <a href="State%20Ballet%20of%20Missouri">State Ballet of Missouri</a> by the age of ten. During this time, Farrar worked long hours and Green accompanied the children to their activities, though perception of her by other parents at the activities varied—some felt she was a supportive mother, while others believed she drove her children too hard and put down their efforts too often.

Farrar admitted that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither one had expressed their love to each other, even at the early stages of marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.

In January 1994, Farrar asked Green for a divorce. Although she believed Farrar was having affairs outside the marriage, she later claimed to have been taken by surprise by his desire to end the marriage and responded to his asking for a divorce explosively, shouting and throwing things. Farrar moved out of the family home, though the two remained in contact and informally shared custody of the children. With the pressure of living together removed, they attempted reconciliation, and decided that a larger house would ease some of the disorganization that had affected their marriage. In May, after four months of separation, they put in a bid on a six-bedroom home in <a href="Prairie%20Village%2C%20Kansas">Prairie Village, Kansas</a>, but backed out before the sale went through. Farrar later said that he had "backed down" in the face of his ongoing worries about the state of his marriage and the couple's debt load.

Shortly after the Prairie Village home purchase fell through, however, the couple's Missouri home caught fire while the family was out. Insurance investigators later determined that the fire was caused by an electrical short in a power cord. Though the house was reparable and the couple's home insurance paid out on the damage and lost property, the couple decided to move on, and Green and the children moved into the apartment in which Farrar had been living during the separation while the purchase of the Prairie Village home was re-negotiated.

The couple put extra effort into avoiding the issues that had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green tried to focus on cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that he could spend more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, and by the end of 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to <a href="Peru">Peru</a> the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.

During their trip to Peru in June 1995, sponsored by The Pembroke Hill School, Farrar met and befriended Margaret Hacker, whose children also attended the school. Hacker was a <a href="registered%20nurse">registered nurse</a> married to an <a href="anesthesiologist">anesthesiologist</a>, and also unhappy with her marriage. The two began an affair shortly after both families returned from Peru. In late July, Farrar again asked Green for a divorce. Green responded hysterically and told the children that their father was leaving them. Green was especially upset that a broken home might later disqualify the children from <a href="debutante">debutante</a> events such as the Belles of the <a href="American%20Royal">American Royal</a>.

Despite the impending divorce, Farrar initially declined to move out of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.

On October 24, during the early morning, Farrar received a phone call at his apartment from a neighbor who shouted that his house—meaning the Farrar–Green family home in Prairie Village—was on fire. Farrar immediately drove there. A <a href="9-1-1">9-1-1</a> call placed from the house at 12:20 a.m. alerted police dispatchers to possible trouble, though the caller did not speak before hanging up. A police cruiser found the house on fire. Fire trucks were dispatched at 12:27 to what was classed as a "two-alarm" fire. The first firefighters on the scene reported that Green and her ten-year-old daughter Kate were safely outside the house by the time they had arrived. Both were in their nightclothes. Kate begged firefighters to help her brother and sister, six-year-old Kelly and thirteen-year-old Timothy, who were still inside. Green stood next to her daughter, and was reported to have been "very calm, very cool". At least two firefighters attempted to search inside the home for the missing children, but the building was so consumed by flames that they could only access a small portion of the ground level before the structure became unsafe.

By the time the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and although high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed the speed with which the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in <a href="Fire%20investigation">arson investigators</a>. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of <a href="smoke%20inhalation">smoke inhalation</a>. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.

The surviving members of the Farrar–Green family were taken from the fire scene to police headquarters for questioning. Detectives were sent to the house to begin an investigation. Local Prairie Village detectives separated Green, Farrar, and their daughter (who was accompanied by Farrar's parents) and began to question Green.

According to video of the police interview, Green reported that the family had a normal day before the fire. The children went to school and performed their chores before attending various after-school activities—Kate went to her dance class, Tim to a hockey game. Farrar had taken Tim and Kelly to the hockey game, while Green took Kate to ballet lessons. The family regrouped around 9 p.m. when Tim and Kelly were dropped back at the Prairie Village house for dinner.

Green told police that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly before he went to bed. Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the household had <a href="pager">paged</a> him. She told police that she and Farrar were in the process of divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.

Green was awoken some time after midnight by the sound of the home's built-in fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, on the roof of the home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.

Detectives noted that during her interview Green did not appear to be or have been crying, and her manner was "talkative, even cheerful". She repeatedly referred to Tim and Kelly Farrar in the past tense, and referred to all of her children by their ages rather than their names. Her accounts of times from the previous evening varied, and she seemed uncertain what time she had done things like gone to bed.

At 5:30 a.m., a detective arrived from the fire scene to advise those at the police station that Tim and Kelly Farrar had been found dead in the home. Green initially reacted with sadness that quickly changed to anger. She shouted at detectives, claiming that firefighters had not done enough to save the children. Where previously she had been cooperative and friendly with the detectives interviewing her, she now began to attack them verbally, calling investigators and their methods "pathetic", alleging that they had withheld from her knowledge of the children's deaths, and demanding to be allowed to see Farrar and the remains of the family's house. Though Green stressed to police that she wanted to be the one to "tell my husband our babies are dead," her request was not granted.

Green was released from the police station in the early morning of October 24 after questioning. With the family home burned down, she had nowhere to stay. Farrar refused to let her stay in his apartment, but gave her some cash, and she rented a room in a local hotel. Ellen Ryan, Green's divorce lawyer, found her there later in the day in a distraught state. She repeatedly asked Ryan whether her children had died, chanted rhythmically about their deaths, and seemed unable to care for herself. Green was transported to a local hospital for treatment but remained emotionally unstable, suffering from insomnia and appearing to Ryan to be unable to take care of day-to-day life, even after her release from the hospital.

Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him immediately that the bodies of Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health over the past six months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the <a href="traveler%27s%20diarrhea">traveler's diarrhea</a> many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe <a href="dehydration">dehydration</a> and high fever. In the hospital, he developed <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a>. Doctors identified "<a href="Streptococcus%20viridans">Streptococcus viridans</a>", which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, <a href="tropical%20sprue">tropical sprue</a>, or <a href="gluten-sensitive%20enteropathy">gluten-sensitive enteropathy</a>. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.

Though Green was caring for Farrar in the family home while he recovered from his repeated bouts of illness, she was also continuing to drink heavily and, increasingly often, claiming to be contemplating suicide or to want Margaret Hacker dead. In late September, Farrar searched the house and her belongings. In her purse, he discovered seed packets labeled as <a href="castor%20bean">castor bean</a>s, a copy of a supposedly-anonymous letter that had been sent to Farrar urging him to not divorce Green, and empty vials of <a href="potassium%20chloride">potassium chloride</a>. He removed all three items from her purse and hid them.

The next day, he asked Green—who had no interest in gardening that he knew of—what she had intended to do with the seeds. Though she initially claimed that she was going to plant them, when pressed she said that she intended to use them to commit suicide. Green's drinking was especially heavy that day, and as her behavior grew stranger, Farrar contacted the police for assistance in placing Green into psychiatric care. Police who responded to the home described Farrar and the children as "shaken" and Green's behavior as "bizarre". Though Green did not seem to hold the police's presence against them and gave them no resistance, she denied being suicidal and called Farrar a series of obscenities. Farrar showed police the seed packets and other items he had found in her purse the day before, and the police transported Green to a nearby <a href="emergency%20department">emergency room</a>. The physician who attended her there found Green to be smelling strongly of alcohol, but not visibly drunk. Though Green appeared unkempt, the doctor felt her demeanor was not unusual for someone going through a bitter divorce and noted that Green professed no desire to hurt herself or others when the doctor interviewed her privately. However, when Farrar came into view in the hospital, Green's demeanor changed. According to the doctor, Green spat at him, called him obscene names, and stated that "You're going to get these kids over our dead bodies". Though Green, with some persuasion by the doctor, initially agreed to a voluntary commitment, she shortly thereafter left the ER without informing anyone. She was found hours later, apparently having decided to walk home from the hospital, and brought back to the hospital. There, she agreed again to a voluntary commitment to the <a href="Menninger%20Foundation">Menninger Clinic</a> in <a href="Topeka%2C%20Kansas">Topeka, Kansas</a>.

While in the hospital for treatment, Green was diagnosed with "major <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar</a> <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a> with suicidal impulses" and placed on <a href="Fluoxetine">Prozac</a>, <a href="Clorazepate">Tranxene</a>, and <a href="Clonazepam">Klonopin</a>. She returned home after four days in the hospital. Farrar, who had researched castor beans in the interim and came to the conclusion that Green had poisoned his food with the <a href="ricin">ricin</a> that could be derived from the beans, moved out immediately upon Green's return home.

Farrar said that the day of the fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, he had taken the day off from work—the first day of what he intended to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He had spent the afternoon with Margaret Hacker and then picked up Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their mother at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.

Throughout the evening on October 23, a series of phone calls between Green and Farrar escalated into a confrontation. Farrar was convinced that Green was continuing to drink heavily while she should have been caring for the children, and he told Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services might be called to protect the children if she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.

During his police interview after the fire, Farrar's red eyes and trembling voice were apparent to detectives. He stated that Green had been "very concerned about money" in the context of their impending divorce, and that she may have set fire to the house to garner an insurance payout, but that she had never given any indication of intending to harm her children.

After his interview with the police, Farrar immediately filed for divorce from Green and for custody of Kate, who had been taken in by his parents while Green and Farrar dealt with the police. A court later awarded temporary custody of Kate to Farrar's parents, due to Green's instability and Kate's professed anger with her father. Green was allowed supervised access during this period, while Farrar's visits were not required to be supervised.

Kate Farrar was interviewed by investigators on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the bedroom door and called to her brother, then closed the door and placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.

Kate reported to police that when she called to her mother after escaping onto the garage roof, Green had been "terribly upset" and called to Kate to jump into her arms. Though Green missed catching her daughter when she did jump, Kate was not hurt. When the two ran into Farrar minutes later, Kate said that Farrar had been accusatory toward Green and Green had been crying and worried about her missing children.

According to Kate, Farrar had moved out of the family home and spurned Green's desire for an amicable separation. Kate stressed that she loved and respected her mother and that all of the children had had good relationships with her, but that she was angry at her father for upsetting her mother by leaving. Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that she had ever seen matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the same route she had, which was via a bedroom window onto the roof.

The <a href="Eastern%20Kansas%20Multi-Agency%20Task%20Force">Eastern Kansas Multi-Agency Task Force</a> was called to conduct an arson investigation on the Prairie Village house on October 24. Staffed by fire investigators and search teams from throughout the area, they focused on determining the origin and cause of the fire, searching through debris for usable evidence and interviewing witnesses. A <a href="Police%20dog">dog trained to detect the scent</a> of fire <a href="Accelerant%23Fire">accelerants</a> was brought in to assist in searching the house.

The investigators ruled out common causes of accidental fires, including electrical panels and furnaces. They determined that the basement level of the home, which contained the furnaces, had not been a point of origin, though two small orphan fires unconnected to the main burning had occurred in that area. Pour patterns were found on the ground and second floors, indicating that a flammable liquid had been poured there and covered many areas of the ground floor, blocked off the stairway from the second floor to the ground floor, and covered much of the hallway on the second floor. The pour patterns stopped at the door of the house's master bedroom, but had soaked into carpeting in the hallway leading to the children's bedrooms. Investigators could not determine the precise liquid used as an accelerant, though they proved that a can of gasoline the family kept in a shed had not been used. The amount of accelerant used was identified as between . Concluding that the fire was a result of arson, the investigators on October 26 called in a second area task force, this one focused on homicide investigation. On October 27, the district attorney for <a href="Johnson%20County%2C%20Kansas">Johnson County</a> was informed that the investigation was now criminal.

In seeking to find who had set fire to the Farrar–Green home, investigators looked first for physical evidence of fire-setting upon those who had been in the house. They suspected that because of the use of accelerant, the fire may have flashed over at the point of ignition and singed or burned the setter. Accordingly, they tested clothing worn by both Farrar and Green that night and took samples of the hair of both. Neither Green's nor Farrar's clothing showed evidence of having been in contact with accelerant; Farrar's hair showed no singeing, but Green's—which had been cut twice between the time of the fire and the time the police took hair samples from her—showed "significant singeing". Detectives recalled that Green had denied ever having been in close proximity to flames; she had reported leaving the house after seeing smoke and not coming into contact with the fire either on the deck outside her bedroom or in the process of coaxing Kate off the garage roof. Neighbors of the family reported that when Green had come to their door to ask them to call for help, her hair had been wet. Though their suspicions pointed to Debora Green, investigators continued to receive tips attributing the fire to any number of people and the investigation continued with no public statement about suspects.

When alerted to the possibility of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the <a href="castor%20beans">castor beans</a> that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the <a href="Earl%20May">Earl May</a> chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the <a href="Olathe%2C%20Kansas">Olathe, Kansas</a> Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.

Farrar underwent surgery in November 1995 to treat an aneurism that his doctors believed had been caused by the poisoning. Before the surgery, he submitted blood samples to Johnson County's crime lab to be tested for ricin <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a>.

Media reports in the first week of November 1995 suggested the investigation had narrowed the field of suspects, first to those intimately familiar with the house, and later to one person.

Green was arrested on November 22 in Kansas City, Missouri, shortly after dropping off her daughter for ballet practice. Though Green's attorneys had requested that if arrested, Green be allowed to turn herself in voluntarily, the police and district attorney felt that her behavior was too unpredictable, and chose to arrest her without warning. Green was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. In a subsequent press conference, District Attorney <a href="Paul%20J.%20Morrison">Paul J. Morrison</a> cited a "domestic situation" as the motive for Green's alleged crimes. Green was initially held in a Missouri jail, then extradited to Johnson County Adult Detention Center in Kansas, on $3,000,000 <a href="bail">bond</a>, the highest bail ever asked for in Johnson County.

A pretrial <a href="show%20cause">show cause</a> hearing in the Green case began in January 1996, with Green represented by <a href="Dennis%20Moore%20%28politician%29">Dennis Moore</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Moriarty">Kevin Moriarty</a>. Green's defense claimed that the fire in the family home had been set not by Debora Green, but by her son, Tim Farrar, who had once been caught by local police setting off <a href="Molotov%20cocktail">Molotov cocktail</a>s. The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.

Michael Farrar underwent surgery in December 1995 to treat an <a href="abscess">abscess</a> in his brain caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would not survive the proceedings, and knowing that his testimony was key to their case, prosecutors videotaped his testimony beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under <a href="cross-examination">cross-examination</a> by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green had contributed to the problems in the couple's marriage and that his relationship with his son had been so adversarial that they had sometimes come to blows.

Witnesses called by the State supported Farrar's and the prosecutors' earlier claims that police had been called to the home a month before the fire, that Green's behavior had been cause for concern at the time, and that Farrar had turned in to police at that time seed packets containing castor beans. The Earl May store clerk who had identified Green as the purchaser of multiple packets of castor bean seeds testified to that effect. Medical evidence was presented that Farrar's illness had not fit neatly within the parameters of any known disease, but that its presentation matched the symptoms of ricin poisoning. An FBI criminologist provided testimony that he had tested for ricin antibodies in Farrar's blood approximately two months after Farrar's last acute symptoms, and found antibodies there in such large amounts that he could confidently state that Farrar had been subjected to repeated exposures to ricin.

A police officer testified that as the first responder to the fire scene in the early morning of October 24, he had found Kate Farrar to be "very frantic" with worry over her siblings, but that Debora Green had showed little, if any, emotion or concern. The defense argued that the psychiatric medications Green had been taking since her September hospitalization could cause <a href="blunted%20affect">blunted affect</a>, which could have led police and fire personnel to erroneously report that Green had been unemotional.

Arson investigators testified as to how they had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended at the door of the master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.

Detectives who had spoken to both Green and Farrar the night of the fire testified as to Green's unusual demeanor during their interview, and a videotape of the questioning was played, including Green's statements about having urged Tim Farrar to stay in the burning house and her references to her children in the past tense.

The State rested on January 31, 1996.

Defense testimony focused on the theory that Tim Farrar, angry at his father, had set fire to the home. Friends of Tim's testified that Tim had had a fascination with fire and that he had told friends that he knew how to make bombs. A neighbor testified that he had once caught Tim burning some grass in the neighbor's yard. A former nanny testified that she had heard Tim speak about wanting his father dead and planning to burn down the family's house, and had caught him multiple times setting or with the implements to set fires. On cross-examination, she admitted that she had not seen Tim Farrar for years and agreed that she had not reported Tim's fascination with fire to his parents or the police when he had expressed it to her.

The defense rested on February 1. The presiding judge ruled that probable cause had been shown to hold Debora Green for trial and her <a href="arraignment">arraignment</a> date was set for February 8, with her trial being projected to start in the summer.

As the crime involved more than one victim, the prosecutors decided to request the death penalty when the case went to trial. When faced with this possibility, Green's defense team brought in Sean O'Brien, a representative of a Missouri anti-capital-punishment group.

A series of legal maneuverings involving both sides took place in the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.

Her defense team undertook its own investigation, hoping to disprove state witnesses' testimony identifying the fire as arson. They found that accelerant had, indeed, been used to stoke the fire and that a robe belonging to Green had been on the floor of the master bathroom, burned in a manner that indicated it had been worn while one of the unconnected fires was set. According to Ellen Ryan, when confronted with this evidence, Green acknowledged having set the fire that destroyed her home, but denied any clear memory of the event. She continued to claim that Tim Farrar had been the one who poisoned his father. Green agreed to place an <a href="Alford%20plea">Alford plea</a> of "no contest".

On April 13, the defense team notified Paul Morrison that Green wished to plea bargain. On April 17 the plea was made public when Debora Green appeared in court to plead no contest to five charges—two counts of capital murder, one of arson, and two of attempted first-degree murder. In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, the no contest plea called for Green to accept a prison sentence of a minimum of forty years without the possibility of parole. Green denied being under the influence of any drug which would affect her judgment in making her plea or her ability to understand the proceedings in which she was participating.

After listening to a reading of the prosecution's case against her, Green read a statement to the court in which she said that she understood that the state had "substantial evidence" that she had caused her children's deaths, and that though her attorneys were prepared to provide evidence that she had not been in control of herself at the time of the children's deaths, she was choosing not to contest the state's evidence in the hope that the end of the case would allow her family, especially her surviving daughter, to begin to heal. In a subsequent press conference, defense counsel Dennis Moore told reporters, "She is accepting responsibility for [the crimes]" but said that "I don't think she ever intended to kill her children."

Green was formally sentenced on May 30, 1996, following testimony by the psychologist who had adjudged her competency. According to Dr. Marilyn Hutchinson, Green was immature and lacked the adult-level ability to cope with emotion. Green read another statement to the court and was formally sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences, minus the one hundred and ninety-one days she had already served. Green is serving her sentence at the <a href="Topeka%20Correctional%20Facility">Topeka Correctional Facility</a>. , <a href="Kansas%20Department%20of%20Corrections">Kansas Department of Corrections</a> records show her earliest possible release date as November 21, 2035—when she will be 84 years old.

After her sentencing Green continued to maintain that her recall of the night of the fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.

In 2000, represented by a new legal team, Green filed a request for a new trial on the basis of having been rendered incompetent by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings. She alleged that her original attorneys had failed to represent her adequately, instead focusing on avoiding a trial and the death penalty. She withdrew the request when prosecutors determined that they would seek the death penalty if a new trial was awarded. When, in 2004, the <a href="Kansas%20Supreme%20Court">Kansas Supreme Court</a> ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional, she filed a second request for a new trial based on a claim of "manifest injustice". Green's attorneys claimed that new scientific techniques invalidated the evidence that the fire had been caused by arson. The request was denied in February 2005.

Though Green has granted no interviews regarding her mental state, a number of sources have attempted to classify her pathology, if any, and her motivation for committing the crimes of which she was convicted. During Green's sentencing hearing, Marilyn Hutchinson, a psychologist hired by the defense, testified about Green's mental state and capabilities. She characterized Green as cognitively competent and capable of controlling her emotion at a basic level, but noted that Green appeared to be lacking in emotion beyond the level of basic competence. Green was prone to monosyllabic answers during her interview with Hutchinson, and described herself as "tuning out" to avoid excessive emotion. Hutchinson described an affidavit from the doctor who had treated Green during her commitment to the Menninger Clinic, which reported that she had been admitted on the basis of having either major or bipolar depression. Evaluations at the Clinic showed Green to be minimally able to cope with the world, and her treating physician reported that Green had been found to have the emotional capabilities of "a very young child", pursuant to unspecified "life experiences" she had undergone as a preadolescent. Hutchinson's diagnosis for Green was <a href="schizoid%20personality%20disorder">schizoid personality disorder</a>. Hutchinson's opinion was that Green's intelligence had generally allowed her to compensate for her limited emotional ability in day-to-day life, but that the external stressors of her impending divorce and the interpersonal conflict between Michael and Tim Farrar had overwhelmed her ability to compensate. She denied that Green was <a href="Antisocial%20personality%20disorder">sociopathic</a>.

Ann Rule began corresponding with Green in 1996, and interviewed her in person in 1997. Rule recalls in her book on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior in the summer and fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in <a href="criminology">criminology</a> and <a href="law%20enforcement">law enforcement</a>—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond the fact that she had come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. <a href="Psychiatry">Psychiatrist</a> Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of <a href="psychopathy">psychopathy</a>, <a href="borderline%20personality%20disorder">borderline personality disorder</a>, and <a href="narcissistic%20personality%20disorder">narcissistic personality disorder</a>.

Authors Cheryl Meyer, Michelle Oberman, and Michelle Rone, discussing the Green case in their book "Mothers Who Kill Their Children: Understanding the Acts of Moms from Susan Smith to the "Prom Mom"", point out that Green was adjudged psychologically competent at what would be commonly considered the least-controlled point of any mental illness from which she was suffering: she was on a cocktail of drugs which could treat the symptoms of mental illness but not the illness itself, she had been drinking alcohol in amounts which she had been warned could interfere with her medications, and she was coping with the loss of her children. Nevertheless, she spoke for her own mental competence at the time, a judgment which was echoed by the court. Meyer, Oberman, and Rone speculate that Green could meet the diagnostic criteria for several mental illnesses, including antisocial personality disorder, but add that the fact that her crimes were a combination of impulsive—arson and the murder of her children—and premeditated—the poisoning of Michael Farrar—makes any mental illness extremely difficult to diagnose.

A May 1996 issue of "<a href="Redbook">Redbook</a>" featured an essay by Ann Slegman, a friend of Green's who lived in the same neighborhood as the Farrar family. The article covered the author's personal history with Green, the fire, and the subsequent investigation and ended with the author's statement that "It is also possible that an entirely different personality—disassociated from the Debora I knew—committed this crime.[...] The Debora I knew would not have killed her children."

Crime author Ann Rule covered the case in her book "Bitter Harvest: A Woman's Fury, a Mother's Sacrifice", which provided extensive detail on both the case's development and Green's personal biography. The book was a <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Bestseller%20List">New York Times Bestseller</a>, though one reviewer felt that Rule failed to address Green's motivation for her crimes and that she had treated Green unsympathetically and Farrar over-sympathetically.

Green's murders and poisoning cases formed the basis for an episode of the forensic science documentary series "<a href="Forensic%20Files%20%28season%204%29">Forensic Files</a>", episode; "Ultimate Betrayal", originally aired; October 1999.

"<a href="Deadly%20Women">Deadly Women</a>", a true-crime documentary program that focuses on crimes committed by women, featured Green's case in a 2010 episode about women who kill their children.

A 2002 working paper on <a href="bioterrorism">bioterrorism</a>, intended to "enable policymakers concerned with bioterrorism to make more informed decisions", included the Green case in a survey of illegal uses of <a href="biological%20agent">biological agent</a>s. The paper noted that Green had refused to provide any detail on the manner in which she extracted and administered the ricin she used against her husband.

1898 United States Senate election in Ohio

On January 12, 1898, the <a href="Ohio%20General%20Assembly">Ohio General Assembly</a> met in <a href="joint%20convention">joint convention</a> to a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senator</a>. The incumbent, <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>, had been appointed by Governor <a href="Asa%20S.%20Bushnell%20%28Governor%29">Asa Bushnell</a> on March 5, 1897, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a> to become <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> to President (and former Ohio governor) <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. Hanna's appointment was only good until the legislature met and made its own choice. The legislature elected Hanna over his fellow <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, Cleveland Mayor <a href="Robert%20McKisson">Robert McKisson</a>, both for the remainder of Sherman's original term (expiring in 1899) and for a full six-year term to conclude in 1905.

Hanna, a wealthy industrialist, had successfully managed <a href="William%20McKinley%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">McKinley's 1896 presidential campaign</a>. The <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Ohio">Ohio Republican Party</a> was bitterly divided between the faction led by McKinley, Hanna and Sherman, and one led by Ohio's other senator, <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Foraker">Joseph B. Foraker</a>. Bushnell was a Foraker ally, and it was only under pressure from McKinley and others that he agreed to appoint Hanna to fill Sherman's Senate seat. After Hanna gained the appointment, Republican legislators kept their majority in the November 1897 election, apparently ensuring Hanna's election once the new body met in January 1898. However, before the legislative session, the <a href="Ohio%20Democratic%20Party">Democrats</a> allied with a number of Republicans, mostly from the Foraker faction, hoping to take control of the legislature and defeat Hanna.

The coalition was successful in taking control of both houses of the legislature; with the Senate election to be held just over a week later, intense politicking took place. Some lawmakers went into hiding for fear they would be pressured by the other side. The coalition decided on McKisson as their candidate the day before the balloting began. Three Republican state representatives who had voted with the Democrats to organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority in both the short and long term elections. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders complained to the United States Senate, which took no action against Hanna. McKisson lost a re-election bid as mayor in 1899; Hanna remained a powerful figure in the Senate until his death in 1904.

<a href="Framers%20of%20the%20Constitution">The members</a> of <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28United%20States%29">the Constitutional Convention of 1787</a>, in drafting <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">the Constitution</a>, empowered state legislatures, not the people, to choose United States Senators. Federal law prescribed that the senatorial election was to take place beginning on the second Tuesday after the legislature which would be in place when the senatorial term expired first met and chose officers. On the designated day, balloting for senator would take place in each of the two chambers of the legislature. If a majority of each house voted for the same candidate, then at the joint convention held the following day at noon, the candidate would be declared elected. Otherwise, there would be a roll-call vote of all legislators, with a majority of those present needed to elect. If a vacancy occurred when the legislature was not in session, the governor could make a temporary appointment to serve until lawmakers convened.
Beginning in about 1888, there were rival factions seeking control of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Ohio">Republican Party of Ohio</a>. In 1896, one faction was led by Senator <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>, former governor <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>, and McKinley's political manager, Cleveland industrialist <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>. The other grouping was led by former governor <a href="Joseph%20Foraker">Joseph Foraker</a>, who had the support of Ohio's current governor, <a href="Asa%20S.%20Bushnell%20%28Governor%29">Asa S. Bushnell</a>. A truce was reached for the 1896 election campaign whereby McKinley's supporters would vote for Foraker in the Ohio Legislature's January 1896 senatorial election, while Foraker would support McKinley's presidential ambitions. Foraker was elected and in June, the senator-elect placed McKinley's name in nomination at the <a href="1896%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1896 Republican National Convention</a>. In the November election, McKinley defeated Democrat <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> to win the presidency; Hanna served as his campaign manager and chief fundraiser. The industrialist raised millions for <a href="William%20McKinley%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">McKinley's campaign</a> but was bitterly attacked by Democratic newspapers for allegedly trying to buy the presidency, with McKinley as his easily dominated agent. In the 1896 election, the issue of the nation's monetary standard was a major issue, with McKinley advocating the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>, while Bryan favored "<a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>", that is, to inflate the money supply by accepting all silver presented to the government and returning the bullion to the depositor in the form of coin, even though the silver in a <a href="Morgan%20dollar">dollar coin</a> was worth only about half that.

After the election, McKinley offered Hanna the post of <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a>, which he turned down, hoping to become a senator if Sherman (whose term was to expire in 1899) was appointed to the Cabinet. McKinley did not believe the rumors, which proved accurate, that the 73-year-old Sherman's mental faculties were failing, and offered him the position of <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> on January 4, 1897. Sherman's acceptance meant that, once he resigned, one of Ohio's Senate seats would be in the gift of Bushnell, with the appointee to serve until the legislature reconvened in January 1898.

Foraker was astonished when he learned that Hanna was seeking the Senate seat, not knowing that the industrialist had political ambitions. He felt that Hanna's campaign activities did not qualify him for legislative service. Hanna and his allies applied considerable pressure on the governor, though initially McKinley did not participate.

Bushnell did not want to appoint Hanna, and offered the seat to Congressman <a href="Theodore%20E.%20Burton">Theodore Burton</a>, a member of neither faction, who turned it down. Historian Wilbur Jones speculates that the seat was refused because of Burton's unwillingness to alienate Hanna's supporters, an action which might sacrifice a career in the House of Representatives for the sake of a few months in the Senate. The governor considered other options, such as arranging to get the position himself or calling a special session of the legislature and have them elect a new senator. However, Bushnell eventually decided that appointing someone else was not worth risking the wrath of the new presidential administration, and of Hanna (who was chairman of the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a>). In late February 1897, McKinley sent a personal emissary, his old friend Judge <a href="William%20R.%20Day">William R. Day</a>, to Bushnell, and the governor yielded. Hanna was given his <a href="commission%20%28document%29">commission</a> by Governor Bushnell in the lobby of Washington's <a href="Arlington%20Hotel%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Arlington Hotel</a> on the morning of March 5, 1897.

Hanna's associates alleged that Bushnell had delayed the appointment of Hanna so that Foraker could be Ohio's senior senator. <a href="Herbert%20Croly">Herbert Croly</a>, in his biography of Hanna, agreed, and McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan also states that Bushnell delayed Hanna's commission for this reason. Hanna biographer William Horner considers this motive possible. In his memoirs, Foraker denied this, stating that Sherman had not resigned from the Senate until the afternoon of March 4, 1897 (the date on which the president and Congress were sworn in) so that Sherman could formally introduce Foraker to the Senate. Sherman, according to Foraker, was also unwilling to resign until he had been confirmed as Secretary of State, which took place on the afternoon of March 4. Foraker noted that he had been senator-elect since his selection by the legislature in January 1896 "and there was no vacancy for which Mr. Hanna could be qualified, except only that to be created by the retirement of Mr. Sherman, and Mr. Sherman refused to retire until I was sworn and in my seat".

Hanna obtained endorsement for election as senator by the 1897 Republican state convention during June in <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a>, and by local conventions in 84 of Ohio's 88 counties. Republicans expressed little opposition to Hanna's candidacy for senator prior to the November state elections, at which Ohioans elected a governor, other statewide officials, and a legislature. There was much national interest in the legislative campaign, which was seen as a rematch of 1896 and a forerunner of the 1900 presidential campaign, and as a referendum on Mark Hanna. President McKinley both campaigned on Hanna's behalf in Ohio and recruited speakers for him; for the Democrats, Bryan was the leading orator. Democrats hoped that by gaining a majority in the legislature and frustrating Hanna's election bid, they could claim a reversal of the voters' verdict in the 1896 presidential race, and exact revenge on the man who had helped orchestrate their defeat. While the question of whether Hanna should continue in the Senate was central to the campaign, also discussed was whether McKinley's policies, including the <a href="Dingley%20Tariff">Dingley Tariff</a>, had brought prosperity, as well as the issue of <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a> versus the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>. The Democrats, as was their custom, did not endorse a specific candidate for Senate, but Cincinnati publisher <a href="John%20Roll%20McLean">John R. McLean</a> was widely spoken of as the party's rival for Hanna's seat until strategists decided that his wealth and business background did not provide adequate contrast to Hanna, and McLean was forced into the background.

During the campaign, <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>'s "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York Journal</a>" renewed the savage attacks on Hanna which had marked the 1896 presidential campaign; Hanna was depicted as a bloated <a href="plutocrat">plutocrat</a>, frequently trampling a skull marked "Labor" and dominating a shrunken, childlike McKinley. Foraker was not prominent in support of Hanna; he did endorse his junior colleague in mid-September, and made several speeches soon after the announcement, but thereafter maintained a public silence which would continue until after the vote for senator by the newly elected legislature in January 1898.

Hanna made speeches across the state, much to the curiosity of Ohioans, who had heard a great deal about him for his activities on behalf of McKinley, but who did not know him well. He had rarely been called upon to make public addresses. McKinley recommended his personal technique of thoroughly laying out a speech in advance, but Hanna found it did not work well for him. Instead, he preferred to compose a brief introduction and then speak extemporaneously, not always even being certain of what topics he would address. According to his biographer, Herbert Croly, the informality of Hanna's speeches won over many in his audience, and he became known as a very effective public speaker. According to Philip Warken in his thesis on the 1898 Senate election, "The campaign probably worked to Hanna's advantage. The shadowy figure in the background took on shape and form, the candidate's public appearances tending to break down [Davenport's] popular but distorted image of him." When Democrats attacked Hanna, who had considerable financial interests in industry, as a "labor crusher", he gave speeches inviting listeners to ask his workers whether they were well treated. Subsequently, several union leaders and workmen's committees confirmed that they had no complaint against Hanna.

In the November election, 62 Republicans and 47 Democrats were elected to the <a href="Ohio%20House%20of%20Representatives">Ohio House of Representatives</a>, while in the <a href="Ohio%20Senate">Ohio Senate</a> there were 18 Democrats, 17 Republicans, and 1 Independent Republican elected. This meant a majority of 15 for the Republicans on joint ballot, ample, it was thought, to secure Hanna's election.

The first public inkling that there might still be a serious contest for Hanna's Senate seat came the day after the November vote, when Governor Bushnell declared that the party's majority in the legislature was sufficient to elect a Republican as senator, but refrained from mentioning Hanna by name. Newspapers took note of the fact that while Bushnell had won a second term by 28,000 votes in the election, the balloting for the legislature had gone Republican by only 9,000. Soon after the election, a number of Republicans announced that they intended to ally with the Democrats and defeat Hanna.

Croly lists Bushnell, Cleveland Mayor <a href="Robert%20McKisson">Robert McKisson</a>, and former Republican state chairman Charles L. Kurtz as among those involved in what he called a conspiracy against Hanna. Kurtz had been defeated in his re-election bid to the chairmanship by Hanna forces at the 1897 Republican state convention, while McKisson had unsuccessfully sought Hanna's support in his first election run in 1895, and according to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, held a grudge as a result. Hanna had also opposed his re-election in the municipal elections held in early 1897, speaking highly of McKisson's opponent to a reporter, and asking the reporter whether it was true that McKisson had secured renomination as mayor through fraud. Despite poor treatment by the Hanna campaign—McKisson had been relegated to obscure rallies, except when called upon to introduce the candidate at a huge Cleveland event, and the Hanna supporters had sought to remove McKisson men from election positions—McKisson had publicly supported Hanna for senator, making several speeches on the night before election day urging Republicans to vote the straight party ticket. Nevertheless, sample ballots were sent to Cleveland voters, telling them how best to cast their ballots so as to minimize Hanna's chances, and Warken speculated that these had to come from McKisson, as the only person with motive and opportunity.

<a href="Charles%20Dick">Charles Dick</a>, then Hanna's aide and later his successor as senator, recounted, "The opposition developed immediately after the election. I might say the plotting, so far as the bolters were concerned, began before the election ... The fifteen majority melted away." According to Horner, "as men elected to the Ohio legislature who were pledged to support Hanna continued to turn up opposing him ... the chances of Hanna retaining his seat began to look rather grim". Kurtz disavowed the Toledo convention's endorsement of Hanna, describing the gathering as controlled by the senator's paid agents. He stated his case against Hanna: "The returns of the recent election show that he is not wanted by the party. The days of Mr. Hanna's bossism are over. The people here are against him, and that settles it."

Several of the men who opposed Hanna came from Cleveland and elsewhere in <a href="Cuyahoga%20County%2C%20Ohio">Cuyahoga County</a>, where Mayor McKisson was influential. The situation in Cincinnati's <a href="Hamilton%20County%2C%20Ohio">Hamilton County</a> (home to Foraker) was complicated by the fact that the Republican legislators from there had run on a <a href="fusion%20ticket">fusion ticket</a> with the Democrats in order to defeat the local Republican bosses. These men were "<a href="Silver%20Republican%20Party">Silver Republicans</a>", as was the Independent Republican elected from Cincinnati, supporting "free silver" in opposition to McKinley, and had not pledged during the campaign to vote for Hanna if elected.

Foraker was not actively involved in the controversy, and in the sole interview he gave, said he was doing his best to keep out of it. Nevertheless, most of Hanna's Republican opponents were from Foraker's wing of the party. Ohio's senior senator did, however, state his belief that Hanna would have a difficult time being elected. When asked by Hanna supporters to intercede with the insurgents, Foraker responded, "I will not antagonize lifetime friends for Hanna," and that Hanna was "not honorable enough" to go to Bushnell and Kurtz and work out a solution.

The new legislature convened in Columbus on Monday, January 3, 1898. In the state House of Representatives, nine anti-Hanna Republicans aligned with the Democrats, electing one of the nine as Speaker. In the state Senate, an anti-Hanna Republican did not initially attend, allowing the Democrats to organize the chamber and elect one of their own as president of the body. The various legislative offices were divided between the Democrats and the insurgent Republicans. Democratic forces in the Ohio Senate were boosted when the absent Republican appeared and voted with them. A margin of three in the House and two in the Senate translated into a likely margin of five against Hanna on the senatorial vote, meaning that three legislators would have to switch sides for him to retain his position.

After the combine's success in the legislature, the Hanna-controlled Republican state committee called on local activists to come to Columbus. A rally took place on the day of Governor Bushnell's second inauguration, and many in the streets booed him. Much of the indignation focused on Bushnell as the only statewide official linked with the insurgents. Meetings were held across the state and petitions circulated, for the most part supporting Hanna and denouncing Bushnell, Kurtz, and McKisson. Croly described the scene in the days leading up to the vote for senator:

Hanna's forces went to great lengths to pick up the votes he needed for his election. According to Croly, they received word that state Representative John Griffith of <a href="Union%20County%2C%20Ohio">Union County</a> was under constant guard at the Great Southern Hotel, but was considering switching to Hanna's side. Hanna operatives aided his escape, and he was kept with his wife at Hanna headquarters at the Neil House until the vote. However, Warken related that Griffith "seemed to align himself with the group that talked to him last", repeatedly changing his position and eventually supporting Hanna. Hanna supporters sought to persuade other coalition Republicans to return to the fold—by one account, a Cleveland Republican tearfully refused, stating that if he voted for Hanna, McKisson would cut him off as a supplier of brick <a href="Paver%20%28flooring%29">pavers</a> to the city. President McKinley did his best to help Hanna, sending a letter to one Republican whose vote was doubtful, delivered by a soldier.

On January 9, newspapers printed allegations that Hanna had arranged to bribe John Otis, one of the Silver Republicans from Cincinnati. Otis alleged that he was offered $10,000 and was actually paid $1,750. The individual said to have offered the money, a New Yorker named Henry H. Boyce, had met with Hanna adviser Estes Rathbone at least twice. Boyce denied trying to bribe Otis, though he did admit to giving a retainer payment to Otis's lawyer, and fled the state when the matter became public. Hanna denied any involvement. His opponents hoped that the incident would preface his defeat, while his supporters feared the story would prompt a public outcry. Croly and Horner agree that the allegations had little impact on public opinion.

The legislative leaders had not settled on a candidate to stand against Hanna, and discussions continued until January 10, a day before the houses would vote. Democrats had tentatively agreed to vote for a Republican for senator, but were unwilling to consider a supporter of the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>. They considered giving a "complimentary" vote (that is, to honor the recipient) to Cincinnati publisher <a href="John%20R.%20McLean%20%28publisher%29">John R. McLean</a>, a Democrat, before switching to a Republican. There being no requirement that the same person be elected for both the short and long Senate terms, Democrats also tried to negotiate for one of their party to be elected at least for the short term expiring in 1899. Under the latter scenario, Governor Bushnell was proposed in the long term election, but Bushnell was unwilling to support silver. At last, McKisson was decided on by the insurgents for both the short and long terms. The plan was announced on January 10, together with a statement from McKisson, which he soon disavowed: that though he would if elected remain in name a Republican, he would support the 1896 pro-silver "Chicago Platform" of Bryan and his Democrats.

Ultimately, the contest came down to the votes of two Cincinnati Silver Republicans. The Hanna campaign at last secured the votes of both men; Croly related that one of them, Charles F. Droste, had initially sought to advance the candidacy of a free silver Republican, Col. Jeptha Garrard of Cincinnati, and when it was clear that no one else supported Garrard, agreed to give Hanna his vote. Warken deemed the combine's failure to support Garrard "the greatest blunder of the anti-Hanna coalition. If they had pushed the Colonel's candidacy they might have secured the support of the free silver men among the Cincinnati fusionists". After the vote, McKisson rejected such criticisms: the combine would never have held together to vote for a silver-supporting candidate. A contemporary account calls the men's decision to support Hanna "unexplained", and that "each of these Cincinnati members had been offered the Senatorship if he would withdraw from Mr. Hanna. Whether this offer could have been made good or not is doubtful".

The balloting in the separate chambers of the legislature took place on January 11, 1898. In the Ohio House, Hanna received 56 votes to 49 for McKisson, with Columbus Congressman <a href="John%20J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLentz">John J. Lentz</a>, state Representative <a href="Aquila%20Wiley">Aquila Wiley</a> and former congressman <a href="Adoniram%20J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BWarner">Adoniram J. Warner</a> receiving one each. The vote was the same for the short and the long term. Hanna's 56 votes were all from Republicans; McKisson received the ballots of 43 Democrats and six Republicans. The other three votes were cast by Democrats unwilling to support a Republican. One Democratic representative was absent due to illness on both days of the voting. In the Senate, there were identical votes for short and long term. McKisson received the votes of 18 Democrats and one Republican, while Hanna won the vote of 16 Republicans and the one Independent Republican. The split between the two houses meant that there would be a roll-call vote of the two houses in joint convention the following day. Nevertheless, if Hanna held all 73 votes cast for him, he would be elected.

According to <a href="Alfred%20Henry%20Lewis">Alfred Henry Lewis</a> of Hearst's "Journal", writing on January 12, "The opposition to Hanna was utterly disorganized by the history of yesterday, and practically speaking, went into joint session today somewhat like a routed army might take up some battle it could not avoid." The 73 men pledged to Hanna went to the <a href="Ohio%20State%20House">State House</a> together under the protection of Hanna adherents. Croly related: "Armed guards were stationed at every important point. The State House was filled with desperate and determined men." In the joint convention, held in the House Chamber, the journals of the two houses were read, detailing the tallies from the previous day. The clerks of the two houses then called the rolls. The only votes to change were those which had gone to Warner and Wiley; both were switched to McKisson. Representative Aquila Wiley was the last person to vote; with Hanna having already received the 73 ballots he needed for election, Wiley maintained his vote for Lentz. The final tally, both for the short and long term was Hanna 73, McKisson 70, and Lentz 1. Before the joint convention adjourned, Hanna appeared before it, thanking the legislators for his election. He stated, "I doubly thank you because under the circumstances it comes to me as an assurance of your confidence".

Newspaper reaction to the result was generally along partisan lines. The "<a href="Cincinnati%20Commercial%20Tribune">Cincinnati Commercial Tribune</a>", a Republican paper, stated of Hanna, "And this is the man against whom has been waged a war than which political history furnishes none more venomous, vicious, and relentlessly vituperative. It is a disgraceful story, known of all men." "<a href="The%20Blade%20%28Toledo%29">The Blade</a>", another Republican paper, agreed, writing, "The fight against Mr. Hanna was the most malignantly traitorous contest ever waged in the political annals of Ohio." "<a href="The%20Cincinnati%20Enquirer">The Cincinnati Enquirer</a>", a Silver Democratic paper, argued, "The Republican contingent which stuck to the last against Hanna has made a record which the victorious faction might well envy ... Their fight was ... against the chairman of the national committee and all its forces and resources; against the president of the United States, with his tremendous party influence and more influential patronage. Against all this they have cut down the man who a year ago was, next to the president, the leading Republican of the United States, to a pitiful majority of one in his ambition to be elected to the Senate, and that obtained under circumstances not creditable to him. They chased him so hard that he dare not stop to have the gravest charges investigated." Hearst's New York "Journal" noted, "And so it is to be 'Senator Hanna' for seven years. Well, the senatorship can add nothing to its holder's power for evil. As long as Hanna has his money he can control senatorships, whether he occupies them or not. Perhaps it is best to have him in the open."
McKisson "had recognized that to lose the fight meant political death". In June 1898, McKisson and his Cuyahoga County delegation were excluded from the Republican state convention in favor of a Hanna-backed delegation. Hanna forces had lost at the county level, but, alleging irregularities, had met and sent a rival delegation. McKisson ran for a third term as mayor in 1899. He survived a bitter battle in the Republican primary, but was defeated in the general election, leading to a decade of dominance by the Democrats in Cleveland. McKisson returned to his career as an attorney, continuing to practice law in Cleveland until his death in 1915 at age 52.

Both houses of the legislature voted to form committees to investigate alleged bribery in the result, though most Republicans abstained from voting on the resolutions. The House committee investigation ended inconclusively. The Ohio Senate committee declined to allow Hanna's attorney to participate in the proceedings. Relying on legal advice, Hanna refused to testify and asked supporters not to cooperate. The state Senate committee reported that an attempt to bribe Otis had been made by an unknown agent of Hanna; three Hanna aides, including Charles Dick, were implicated. The report was sent to the US Senate in May 1898, which referred it to the Committee on Privileges and Elections. The Republican majority of the committee reported in February 1899 that while it accepted that an attempt had been made to bribe Otis, the matter had been known before the vote, Otis had voted for McKisson anyway, and that there was no evidence linking Hanna to the attempt. The report did mildly admonish Hanna and his associates for not cooperating with the Ohio Senate committee. Democrats on the Privileges and Elections Committee urged further investigation, but the US Senate ordered the committee's report to be printed, and took no further action. Hanna remained a power in the Senate until his death in 1904.

The extent to which money or patronage affected the outcome of the election is unclear. Congressman Burton stated, "I never saw any evidence of the use of money in Columbus and don't believe that any money was used corruptly." In an interview after Hanna's death, <a href="James%20Rudolph%20Garfield">James Rudolph Garfield</a>, son of the late president and floor leader of the Hanna forces in the Ohio Senate, recalled that the senator "had been asked to shut his eyes to some things. But he declined to do it." However, Garfield also noted, "I have never been sure as to what some of the men who called themselves Senator Hanna's friends really did do." Croly believed that Hanna did not personally authorize bribes of legislators, but concedes that Hanna's supporters "may have been willing to spend money in Mr. Hanna's interest and without his knowledge." The biographer suggested, "If Mr. Hanna had himself planned to purchase the vote of John C. Otis, it is reasonable to believe that the business would have been better managed." Horner believes it impossible to ascertain if corruption took place, but if Hanna bribed legislators, it was because it was a common practice on both sides. He notes of Hanna, "his career as a senator continued, but accusations of wrongdoing remain a part of his legacy well over a century later." Public dismay at what was seen as a corrupt means of choosing federal lawmakers was a major factor in the ratification of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> in 1913, which took the privilege of electing senators out of state legislators' hands and gave it to the people.

Albertus Soegijapranata, <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">SJ</a> (; <a href="EYD">Perfected Spelling</a>: Albertus Sugiyapranata; 25 November 1896 – 22 July 1963), better known by his birth name Soegija, was a <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priest who became the Apostolic Vicar of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Semarang">Semarang</a> and later its <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a>. He was the first <a href="native%20Indonesian">native Indonesian</a> bishop and known for his pro-<a href="Indonesian%20National%20Awakening">nationalistic</a> stance, often expressed as "100% Catholic, 100% Indonesian".

Soegija was born in <a href="Surakarta">Surakarta</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, to a Muslim <a href="courtier">courtier</a> and his wife. The family moved to nearby <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a> when Soegija was still young; there he began his education. Known as a bright child, around 1909 he was asked by Father <a href="Frans%20van%20Lith">Frans van Lith</a> to enter Xaverius College, a <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> school in <a href="Muntilan">Muntilan</a>, where Soegija slowly became interested in Catholicism. He was baptised on 24 December 1910. After graduating from Xaverius in 1915 and spending a year as a teacher there, Soegija spent two years at the on-site <a href="seminary">seminary</a> before going to the Netherlands in 1919. He began his two-year <a href="novitiate">novitiate</a> with the Society of Jesus in September 1920 in <a href="Grave%2C%20North%20Brabant">Grave</a>, and finished his juniorate there in 1923. After three years studying philosophy at Berchmann College in <a href="Oudenbosch">Oudenbosch</a>, he was sent back to Muntilan as a teacher for a further two years. In 1928, he returned to the Netherlands to study theology at <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>, where he was <a href="Ordination">ordained</a> by <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Roermond">Bishop of Roermond</a> Laurentius Schrijnen on 15 August 1931; Soegija then added the word "pranata" to the back of his name. He was then sent back to the Indies to preach and became a parochial vicar at the parish in Kidul Loji, Yogyakarta, and in 1934 he was given his own parish in Bintaran. There he focused on creating a sense of Catholicism within the native community, emphasising the need for strong bonds between Catholic families. Soegijapranata was <a href="consecrated">consecrated</a> as the vicar apostolic of the newly established <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Semarang">Apostolic Vicariate of Semarang</a> in 1940.

Although the population of native Catholics expanded greatly in the years following his consecration, Soegijapranata was soon faced with numerous trials. The Empire of Japan <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">invaded the Indies</a> beginning in early 1942, and during the ensuing <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">occupation</a> numerous churches were seized and clergymen were arrested or killed. Soegijapranata was able to resist several of these seizures, and spent the rest of the occupation serving the Catholics in his vicariate. After President <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a> <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">proclaimed the country's independence</a> in August 1945, Semarang was overcome with unrest. Soegijapranata helped broker a ceasefire after a five-day battle between Japanese and Indonesian troops and called for the central government to send someone to deal with the unrest and food shortages in the city. However, these problems continued to grow, and in 1947 Soegijapranata moved his <a href="cathedra">seat</a> to Yogyakarta. For the remainder of the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">national revolution</a> Soegijapranata worked to promote international recognition of Indonesia's independence. Soon after the Dutch, who had returned in late 1945, recognised the country's independence, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. During the post-revolution years he wrote extensively against communism and expanded the church; he also served as a mediator between several political factions. He was made an archbishop on 3 January 1961, when Semarang was elevated to an <a href="ecclesiastical%20province">ecclesiastical province</a>. At the time he was in Europe, participating in the first session of the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a>. Soegijapranata died in 1963, in <a href="Steyl">Steyl</a>, the Netherlands. His body was flown back to Indonesia, where he was made a <a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Indonesia">national hero</a> and interred at <a href="Giri%20Tunggal%20Heroes%27%20Cemetery">Giri Tunggal Heroes' Cemetery</a> in Semarang.

Soegijapranata continues to be viewed with respect by both Catholic and non-Catholic Indonesians. Several biographies have been written, and in 2012 a fictionalised <a href="biopic">biopic</a> by <a href="Garin%20Nugroho">Garin Nugroho</a>, entitled "<a href="Soegija">Soegija</a>", was released to popular acclaim. <a href="Soegijapranata%20Catholic%20University">Soegijapranata Catholic University</a>, a large university in Semarang, is named after him.

Soegija was born on 25 November 1896 in <a href="Surakarta">Surakarta</a> to Karijosoedarmo, an "abdi dalem" (<a href="courtier">courtier</a>) at the <a href="Sunanate%20of%20Surakarta">Sunanate of Surakarta</a>, and his wife Soepiah. The family was "<a href="abangan">abangan</a>" Muslim, and Soegija's grandfather Soepa was a "<a href="kyai">kyai</a>"; Soegija followed their religion. Soegija – whose name was derived from the Javanese word , meaning rich – was the fifth of nine children. The family later moved to Ngabean, <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>. There, Karijosoedarmo began to serve as a courtier at the <a href="Kraton%20Ngayogyakarta%20Hadiningrat">Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat</a> to Sultan <a href="Hamengkubuwono%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII">Hamengkubuwono VII</a>, while his wife sold fish; despite this, the family was poor and sometimes had little food. Soegija was a daring child, quick to fight, skilled at <a href="association%20football">football</a>, and noted for his intellect from a young age. While Soegija was still young, his father made him <a href="sawm">fast</a> in accordance with Islamic law.

Soegija started his formal education at a school in the Kraton complex, known locally as a (Number Two School), where he learned to read and write. He later transferred to a school in Wirogunan, Yogyakarta, near <a href="Pakualaman">Pakualaman</a>. Beginning in his third year he attended a Dutch-run school for <a href="native%20Indonesians">native Indonesian</a> () in Lempuyangan. Outside of school he studied <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a> and singing with his parents. Around 1909 he was asked by Father <a href="Frans%20van%20Lith">Frans van Lith</a> to join the <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> school in <a href="Muntilan">Muntilan</a>, north-west of Yogyakarta. Although his parents were initially worried that Soegija would become too <a href="Europeanisation">Europeanised</a>, they agreed.

In 1909 Soegija started at the Xaverius College in Muntilan, a school for aspiring teachers, and stayed in the dormitory. He was one of 54 students in his year. The boys followed a strict schedule, attending classes in the morning and engaging in other activities, such as gardening, discussions, and chess, in the afternoon. The Catholic students had regular prayers. Although the college did not require students to be Catholic, Soegija was pressured by his Catholic classmates, leading to several fights. Feeling dissatisfied, Soegija complained to his teacher that the Dutch priests were like merchants, thinking only of money. The priest replied that the teachers were unpaid and only hoped for the students' good. This led Soegija to better respect the priests, and when van Rijckevorsel told the other students that Soegija did not want to be Catholic, they stopped pressuring him.
The following year Soegija asked to join the Catholic-education classes, citing a desire to fully use the facilities at Xaverius. His teacher, Father Mertens, told Soegija that he required permission from his parents first; although they refused, Soegija was nevertheless allowed to study Catholicism. He was intrigued by the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>, and asked several of the priests for clarification. Van Lith cited the works of <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>, while Mertens discussed the Trinity as explained by <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>; the latter told him that humans were not meant to understand God with their limited knowledge. Soegija, who wanted to learn more, asked to be <a href="baptised">baptised</a>, quoting the <a href="Finding%20in%20the%20Temple">Finding in the Temple</a> to show why he should not need his parents' permission. The priests agreed, and Soegija was baptised on 24 December 1910, taking the <a href="baptismal%20name">baptismal name</a> Albertus, for <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a>. During Christmas holidays, he told his family that he had converted. Although his immediate family eventually accepted this, and may have eventually supported him, Soegija's other relatives refused to speak to him afterwards.

Soegija and the students continued their education at Xaverius, receiving further instruction. According to Father G. Budi Subanar, a lecturer on theology at <a href="Sanata%20Dharma%20University">Sanata Dharma University</a>, during this period one of the teachers taught the <a href="Catholic%20doctrine%20regarding%20the%20Ten%20Commandments">Fourth Commandment</a>, "Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you.", as relating not only to one's birth father and mother, but all who had come before; this left the students with <a href="nationalism">nationalistic</a> tendencies. On another occasion, a visit by a <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin">Capuchin</a> missionary – who was physically quite different from the Jesuit teachers – led Soegija to consider becoming a priest, an idea which his parents accepted. In 1915 Soegija finished his education at Xaverius, but stayed on as a teacher. The following year he joined the on-site <a href="seminary">seminary</a>, one of three native Indonesians who entered the seminary that year. He graduated in 1919, having studied French, Latin, Greek, and literature.

Soegija and his classmates sailed to <a href="Uden">Uden</a>, in the Netherlands, to further their studies in 1919. In Uden Soegija spent a year further studying Latin and Greek, necessary for his preaching back in the Indies. He and his classmates adapted to Dutch culture. On 27 September 1920 Soegija began his <a href="novitiate">novitiate</a> to join the Jesuits, the first of his classmates. While completing his studies at Mariëndaal in <a href="Grave%2C%20North%20Brabant">Grave</a>, he was separated from much of the world and spent his time in introspection. He completed his novitiate on 22 September 1922 and was initiated into the Jesuits, taking their oath of <a href="poverty%2C%20chastity%20and%20obedience">poverty, chastity and obedience</a>.

After joining the Jesuits Soegija spent another year in Mariëndaal in juniorate. Beginning in 1923 he studied philosophy at Berchmann College in <a href="Oudenbosch">Oudenbosch</a>; during this time he examined the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and began writing on Christianity. In a letter dated 11 August 1923, he wrote that the Javanese were so far unable to discern between Catholics and Protestants, and that the best way to convert the Javanese was by deeds, not words. He also translated some of the results of the 27th <a href="International%20Eucharistic%20Congress">International Eucharistic Congress</a>, held in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> in 1924, for the <a href="Javanese-language">Javanese-language</a> magazine "Swaratama", which circulated mainly among Xaverius alumni. Several of Soegija's other writings were published in "St. Claverbond, Berichten uit Java". He graduated from Berchmann in 1926, then began preparations to return to the Indies.

Soegija arrived in Muntilan in September 1926, where he began teaching algebra, religion, and Javanese at Xaverius. Little is known about his period as an instructor at the school, although records indicate that he based his teaching style on that of van Lith, who had died in early 1926, explaining religious concepts in terms based on Javanese tradition. He supervised the school's gamelan and gardening programs and became the chief editor of "Swaratama". Soegijapranata wrote editorials that covered a variety of topics, including condemnations of communism and discussions of various aspects of poverty.

After two years at Xaverius, in August 1928, Soegija returned to the Netherlands, where he studied theology at <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>. On 3 December 1929 he and four other Asian Jesuits joined Jesuit General <a href="Wlodzimierz%20Led%C3%B3chowski">Wlodzimierz Ledóchowski</a> in a meeting with <a href="Pope%20Pius%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BXI">Pope Pius XI</a> in <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican City</a>; the pope told the Asian men that they were to be the "backbones" of Catholicism in their respective nations. Soegija was made a <a href="Deacon%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">deacon</a> in May 1931; he was ordained by <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Roermond">Bishop of Roermond</a> Laurentius Schrijnen on 15 August 1931, while still studying theology. After his ordination, Soegija appended the word , meaning "prayer" or "hope", as a suffix to his birth name; such additions were a common practice in <a href="Javanese%20culture">Javanese culture</a> after its bearer reached an important milestone. He finished his theology studies in 1932 and in 1933 spent his <a href="tertianship">tertianship</a> in <a href="Drongen">Drongen</a>, Belgium. That year he wrote an autobiography, entitled "La Conversione di un Giavanese" ("The Conversion of a Javanese"); the work was released in Italian, Dutch, and Spanish.

On 8 August 1933 Soegijapranata and two fellow priests departed for the Indies; Soegijapranata was assigned to preach at Kidul Loji in Yogyakarta, near Kraton. He served as parochial vicar for Father van Driessche, one of his teachers from Xaverius. The elder priest taught Soegijapranata how to better address the needs of his parish, while van Driessche likely used Soegijapranata to preach to the city's growing native Catholic population. Soegijapranata was, by this point, a short and chubby man with what the Dutch historian Geert Arend van Klinken described as "a boyish sense of humour that won him many friends".

After the St Yoseph Church in Bintaran, about from Kidul Loji, opened in April 1934, Soegijapranata was transferred there to become its priest; the church primarily served the Javanese Catholic community. Bintaran was one of four centres of Catholic presence in Yogyakarta at the time, along with Kidul Loji, Kotabaru, and Pugeran; each major church served a wide area, and the priests from the major churches gave sermons in the furthest reaches of their parishes. After van Driessche's death in June 1934, Soegijapranata's duties were extended to include the village of Ganjuran, <a href="Bantul">Bantul</a>, south of the city, which was home to more than a thousand native Catholics. He was also a spiritual adviser to several local groups and established a Catholic <a href="credit%20union">credit union</a>.

The Catholic Church at the time faced difficulty retaining converts. Some Javanese, who had converted as students, returned to Islam after reentering society and facing <a href="social%20ostracism">social ostracism</a>. In a 1935 meeting with other Jesuits, Soegijapranata blamed the problem on the lack of a united Catholic identity, or "sensus Catholicus", as well as few intermarriages between native Catholics. Soegijapranata opposed marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics. He counselled young Catholic couples before marriage, believing that these unions helped unite the Catholic families in the city, and continued to write for "Swaratama", again serving as its editor in chief. In 1938, he was chosen to advise the Society of Jesus, coordinating Jesuit work in the Indies.

The increasing population of Catholics in the Indies led Mgr. Petrus Willekens, then <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Jakarta">Vicar Apostolic of Batavia</a>, to suggest that a new <a href="apostolic%20vicariate">apostolic vicariate</a> be established in <a href="Central%20Java">Central Java</a>, headquartered in <a href="Semarang">Semarang</a>, as the area was culturally different and geographically separate from Batavia. The Apolistic Vicariate of Batavia was split in two on 25 June 1940; the eastern half became the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Semarang">Apostolic Vicariate of Semarang</a>. On 1 August 1940 Willekens received a telegram from Pro-Secretary of State <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Giovanni Battista Montini</a> ordering that Soegijapranata be put in charge of the newly established apostolic vicariate. This was forwarded to Soegijapranata in Yogyakarta, who agreed to the appointment, despite being surprised and nervous. His assistant Hardjosoewarno later recalled that Soegijapranata cried after reading the telegram – an uncharacteristic response – and, when eating a bowl of <a href="Soto%20%28food%29">soto</a>, asked if Hardjosoewarno had ever seen a bishop eating the dish.

Soegijapranata left for Semarang on 30 September 1940 and was <a href="consecrated">consecrated</a> by Willekens on 6 October at the <a href="Holy%20Rosary%20Cathedral%20%28Semarang%29">Holy Rosary Church</a> in Randusari, which later became his <a href="cathedra">seat</a>; this consecration made Soegijapranata the first native Indonesian bishop. The ceremony was attended by numerous political figures and sultans from Batavia, Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, as well as clergy from <a href="Malang">Malang</a> and <a href="Lampung">Lampung</a>; Soegijapranata's first act as vicar was to issue a <a href="pastoral%20letter">pastoral letter</a> with Willekens that outlined the historical background that led to his appointment, including <a href="Pope%20Benedict%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BXV">Pope Benedict XV</a>'s apolistic letter "<a href="Maximum%20illud">Maximum illud</a>" which called for more local clergy, and Pope Pius XI and <a href="Pope%20Pius%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BXII">Pope Pius XII</a>'s efforts to appoint more pastors and bishops from native ethnic groups worldwide. Soegijapranata began working on the <a href="Church%20hierarchy">Church hierarchy</a> in the region, establishing new parishes.

In Soegijapranata's apostolic vicariate were 84 pastors (73 European and 11 native), 137 <a href="Brother%20%28Catholic%29">brothers</a> (103 European and 34 native), and 330 nuns (251 European and 79 native). The vicariate included Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, <a href="Kudus%20Regency">Kudus</a>, <a href="Magelang">Magelang</a>, <a href="Salatiga">Salatiga</a>, <a href="Pati%20Regency">Pati</a>, and <a href="Ambarawa">Ambarawa</a>; its geographic conditions ranged from the fertile lowlands of the <a href="Kedu%20Plain">Kedu Plain</a> to the arid <a href="Gunung%20Sewu">Gunung Sewu</a> mountainous area. The vast majority of its population was ethnic Javanese, consisting of more than 15,000 native Catholics, as well as a similar number of European Catholics. The number of native Catholics quickly outpaced the number of European ones, and had doubled by 1942. There were also several Catholic groups, mostly working in education. However, the Indonesian Catholics were less prominent than the <a href="Protestantism%20in%20Indonesia">Protestants</a>.

After the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupied the Indies</a> in early 1942, on 9 March 1942 Governor-General <a href="Tjarda%20van%20Starkenborgh%20Stachouwer">Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer</a> and head of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20East%20Indies%20Army">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a> General <a href="Hein%20ter%20Poorten">Hein ter Poorten</a> capitulated. This brought numerous changes in the governance of the archipelago, reducing the quality of life for non-Japanese. In his diary, Soegijapranata wrote of the invasion that "fires were everywhere ... no soldiers, no police, no workers. The streets are full of burnt out vehicles. ... Luckily least there are still some lawmakers and Catholics out there. They work as representatives of their groups to ensure the city is in order."

The occupation government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both clergy and laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade the use of Dutch in services and in writing, and seized several church properties. Soegijapranata attempted to resist these seizures, at times filling the locations with people to make them unmanageable or indicating that other buildings, such as cinemas, would serve Japanese needs better. When the Japanese attempted to seize Randusari Cathedral, Soegijapranata replied that they could take it only after decapitating him; the Japanese later found another location for their office. He prevented the Japanese from taking <a href="St.%20Joseph%27s%20Church%2C%20Semarang">Gedangan Presbytery</a>, where he lived, and assigned guardians for schools and other facilities to prevent seizure. These efforts were not always successful, however, and several Church-run institutions were seized, as were church funds.

Soegijapranata was unable to prevent Japanese torture of <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>, including the clergy, but was himself well-treated by the Japanese forces; he was often invited to Japanese ceremonies, but never attended, sending bouquets in his stead. He used this position of respect to lobby for fair treatment of those interned. He successfully petitioned the Japanese overlords to exempt nuns from the paramilitary draft and allow them to work at hospitals. He and the Catholic populace also gathered food and other supplies for interned clergy, and Soegijapranata kept in contact with the prisoners, supplying and receiving news, such as recent deaths, and other information.

As the number of clergy was severely limited, Soegijapranata roamed from church to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the "de facto" head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled by foot, bicycle, and carriage, as his car had been seized. He sent pastors to <a href="apostolic%20prefecture">apostolic prefecture</a>s in <a href="Bandung">Bandung</a>, <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, and Malang to deal with the lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and convinced them that the streets were safe.

After the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> and the <a href="proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20independence">proclamation of Indonesian independence</a> in August 1945, the Japanese began withdrawing from the country. In support of the new Republic, Soegijapranata had an <a href="Indonesian%20flag">Indonesian flag</a> flown in front of the Gedangan Rectory; however, he did not formally recognise the nation's independence, owing to his correspondence with Willekens regarding the Church's neutrality. He and his clergy treated injured Dutch missionaries, who had recently been released from internment, at the rectory. The Dutch clergy were malnourished, and several required treatment at a hospital. Some were later taken to Indonesian-run internment camps, but the Catholics were still allowed to look after them. Meanwhile, inter-religious strife led to the burning of several mission buildings and the murder of some clergymen. The government also took several buildings, and some that had been seized by the Japanese were not returned.

<a href="Allies%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Allied</a> forces sent to disarm the Japanese and repatriate prisoners of war arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, this led to a conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15 October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20 October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the <a href="Gurkha">Gurkha</a> soldiers posted in front of the building.
Military conflicts throughout the area and an ongoing Allied presence led to food shortages throughout the city, as well as constant blackouts and the establishment of a curfew. Civilian-run groups attempted to deal with the food shortages but were unable to cope. In an attempt to deal with these issues, Soegijapranata sent a local man, Dwidjosewojo, to the capital at <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> – renamed from Batavia during the Japanese occupation – to speak with the central government. Dwidjosewojo met with Prime Minister <a href="Sutan%20Sjahrir">Sutan Sjahrir</a>, who sent <a href="Wongsonegoro">Wongsonegoro</a> to help establish a civilian government, installing Moch. Ikhsan as mayor. The city's government was, however, still unable to handle the crisis, and the major figures in this government were later captured by the Dutch-run Netherlands-Indies Civil Administration (, or NICA) and imprisoned; Soegijapranata, although he at times harboured Indonesian revolutionaries, was spared.

In January 1946 the Indonesian government moved from Jakarta – by then under Dutch control – to Yogyakarta. This was followed by a widespread exodus of civilians fleeing the advancing NICA soldiers. Soegijapranata at first stayed in Semarang, working to establish patrols and watches. He also corresponded with Willekens in Jakarta, although the elder bishop considered the revolution an internal security matter for the Dutch and not an issue for the Church. However, in early 1947 Soegijapranata moved to Yogyakarta, allowing easy communication with the political leadership. He established his seat at St Yoseph in Bintaran and counselled young Catholics to fight for their country, saying that they should only return "once they were dead". Soegijapranata was present during several battles that arose where he was preaching.
After the <a href="Linggadjati%20Agreement">Linggadjati Agreement</a> failed to solve conflicts between Indonesia and the Netherlands and the Dutch <a href="Operation%20Product">attacked republicans</a> on 21 July 1947, Soegijapranata declared that Indonesia's Catholics would work with the Indonesians and called for an end to the war in a speech on <a href="Radio%20Republik%20Indonesia">Radio Republik Indonesia</a>; van Klinken describes the address as "passionate" and considers it to have boosted the Catholic populace's <a href="morale">morale</a>. Soegijapranata wrote extensively to the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>. In response, the Church leadership sent Georges de Jonghe d'Ardoye to Indonesia as its delegate, initiating formal relations between the Vatican and Indonesia. D'Ardoye arrived in the new republic in December 1947 and met with President <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>; however, formal diplomatic relations were not opened until 1950. Soegijapranata later became a friend of the president.

After the Dutch captured the capital during <a href="Operation%20Kraai">Operation Kraai</a> on 19 December 1948, Soegijapranata ordered that the Christmas festivities be kept simple to represent the Indonesian people's suffering. During the Dutch occupation Soegijapranata smuggled some of his writings out of the country; the works, later published in "<a href="Commonweal%20%28magazine%29">Commonweal</a>" with the help of <a href="George%20McTurnan%20Kahin">George McTurnan Kahin</a>, described Indonesians' daily lives under Dutch rule and called for international condemnation of the occupation. Soegijapranata further opined that the Dutch blockade on Indonesia, aside from strangling the new country's economy, increased the influence of its communist groups. After the Dutch retreated in the wake of the General Attack of 1 March 1949, Soegijapranata began working to ensure Catholic representation in the government. With I. J. Kasimo, he organised the All-Indonesia Catholic Congress (). Held between 7 and 12 December, the congress resulted in the union of seven Catholic political parties into the <a href="Catholic%20Party%20%28Indonesia%29">Catholic Party</a>. Soegijapranata continued his efforts to consolidate the Party after the revolution.

After the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence on 27 December 1949, following a <a href="Dutch%E2%80%93Indonesian%20Round%20Table%20Conference">several month-long conference</a> in <a href="the%20Hague">the Hague</a>, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be allowed into the country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.

Aside from overseeing the new clergy, Soegijapranata continued to work towards Catholic education and prosperity, similar to his pre-war work. He emphasised that students must not only be good Catholics, but also good Indonesians. The Church began further development of its schools, ranging from elementary schools to universities. Soegijapranata also began reforming the Church in his apostolic vicariate, making it more Indonesian. He advocated the use of local languages and Indonesian during mass, allowing it throughout his diocese beginning in 1956. In addition, he pressed for the use of gamelan music to accompany services, and agreed to the use of <a href="wayang">wayang</a> shows to teach the Bible to children.

As the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> heated up, tensions developed between the Church in Indonesia and the <a href="Indonesian%20Communist%20Party">Indonesian Communist Party</a> (, or PKI). Soegijapranata believed that the PKI was making progress with the poor through its promises of <a href="workers%27%20rights">workers' rights</a> in a communist-led union. To combat this, he worked with other Catholics to establish <a href="Labour%20movement">labour groups</a>, open to both Catholics and non-Catholics. He hoped that these would empower workers and thus limit the PKI's influence. One such labour group was Buruh Pancasila, which was formed on 19 June 1954; through the organisation Soegijapranata helped promote the state philosophy of <a href="Pancasila%20%28politics%29">Pancasila</a>, literally "the five tenets". The following year the Church Representatives Conference of Indonesia (, or KWI), recognising Soegijapranata's devotion to the poor, put him in charge of establishing <a href="social-support">social-support</a> programmes throughout the archipelago. On 2 November 1955, he and several other bishops issued a decree denouncing communism, Marxism, and <a href="Dialectical%20materialism">materialism</a>, and asking the government to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all citizens. Relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands continued to be poor, specifically in regard to control of <a href="West%20Papua%20%28region%29">West Papua</a>, historically under Dutch control but claimed by Indonesia. Soegijapranata firmly supported the Indonesian position; West Papua was annexed in 1963. 

There was also friction within the Catholic groups, first over Sukarno's 1957 decree that he was president for life and establishment of a <a href="Guided%20Democracy%20in%20Indonesia">guided democracy policy</a>. A faction, led by Soegijapranata, supported this decree, while Catholic Party leader I. J. Kasimo's faction was heavily against it. Sukarno, who had a good working relationship with Soegijapranata, asked the vicar to join the National Council, a request that Soegijapranata refused; he did, however, assign two delegates to the Council, ensuring Catholic representation. This, along with Soegijapranata's support of Sukarno's <a href="President%20Sukarno%27s%201959%20Decree">decree on 5 July 1949</a> calling for a return to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Indonesia">1945 constitution</a>, resulted in Bishop of Jakarta Adrianus Djajasepoetra's denunciation of Soegijapranata as a <a href="Sycophancy">sycophant</a>. However, Soegijapranata was strongly against Sukarno's idea of <a href="Nasakom">Nasakom</a>, which based part of the nation's government on communism.

During the latter half of the 1950s, the KWI met several times to discuss the need for a self-determined Indonesian Roman Catholic hierarchy. At these annual meetings, they touched on administrative and pastoral issues, including the translation of songs into <a href="Languages%20of%20Indonesia">Indonesian languages</a>. In 1959 Cardinal <a href="Gr%C3%A9goire-Pierre%20Agagianian">Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian</a> visited the country to see the Church's preparations. The KWI formally requested their own hierarchy in a May 1960 letter; this letter received a reply from <a href="Pope%20John%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BXXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> dated 20 March 1961, which divided the archipelago into six <a href="ecclesiastical%20province">ecclesiastical province</a>s: two in Java, one in <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, one in <a href="Flores">Flores</a>, one in <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> and <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Maluku</a>, and one in <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. Semarang became the seat of the province of Semarang, and Soegijapranata its <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a>. He was elevated on 3 January 1961.

When this happened, Soegijapranata was in Europe to attend the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a> as part of the <a href="Central%20Preparatory%20Commission">Central Preparatory Commission</a>; he was one of eleven diocesan bishops and archbishops from Asia. He was able to attend the first session, where he voiced concerns about declining quality of pastoral work and called for the modernisation of the Church. He then returned to Indonesia, but his health, poor since the late 1950s, quickly declined.

After a stay at Elisabeth Candi Hospital in Semarang in 1963, Soegijapranata was forbidden from undertaking active duties. <a href="Justinus%20Darmojuwono">Justinus Darmojuwono</a>, a former internee of the Japanese army and <a href="vicar%20general">vicar general</a> of Semarang since 1 August 1962, served as acting bishop. On 30 May 1963 Soegijapranata left Indonesia for Europe to attend the election of <a href="Pope%20Paul%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVI">Pope Paul VI</a>. Soegijapranata then went to Canisius Hospital in <a href="Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a>, where he underwent treatment from 29 June until 6 July; this was unsuccessful. He died on 22 July 1963, at a nunnery in <a href="Steyl">Steyl</a>, the Netherlands, having had a heart attack shortly before his death.

As Sukarno did not want Soegijapranata buried in the Netherlands, his body was flown to Indonesia after last rites were performed by Cardinal <a href="Bernardus%20Johannes%20Alfrink">Bernardus Johannes Alfrink</a>. Soegijapranata was declared a <a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Indonesia">National Hero of Indonesia</a> on 26 July 1963, through Presidential Decree No. 152/1963, while his body was still in transit. Soegijapranata's body arrived at <a href="Kemayoran%20Airport">Kemayoran Airport</a> in Jakarta on 28 July and was brought to the <a href="Jakarta%20Cathedral">Jakarta Cathedral</a> for further rites, including a speech by Sukarno, presided by Bishop of Jakarta Adrianus Djajasepoetra. The following day Soegijapranata's body was flown to Semarang, accompanied by several Church and government luminaries. He was buried at <a href="Giri%20Tunggal%20Heroes%27%20Cemetery">Giri Tunggal Heroes' Cemetery</a> in a military funeral on 30 July, after several further rites. Darmojuwono was appointed as the new archbishop in December 1963; he was consecrated on 6 April 1964 by Archbishop Ottavio De Liva.

Soegijapranata is remembered with pride by Javanese Catholics, who praise his strength of will during the occupation and national revolution. The historian Anhar Gonggong described Soegijapranata as not just a bishop, but an Indonesian leader who "was tested as a good leader and deserved the hero status". The Indonesian historian Anton Haryono described Soegijapranata's ascension to bishophood as "monumental", considering that Soegijapranata had only been ordained nine years previously and was chosen ahead of non-Indonesian priests several years his senior. Henricia Moeryantini, a nun in the Order of Carolus Borromeus, writes that the Catholic Church became nationally influential under Soegijapranata, and that the archbishop cared too much for the people to take an outsider's approach. Van Klinken writes that Soegijapranata eventually became like a "<a href="priyayi">priyayi</a>", or Javanese nobleman, within the church, as "committed to hierarchy and the status quo as to the God who created them". According to van Klinken, by coming to the nascent republic Soegijapranata had been willing to see "the coming Javanese paradise" at a great personal risk.

Soegijapranata is the namesake of <a href="Soegijapranata%20Catholic%20University">a large Catholic university</a> in Semarang. Streets in several Indonesian cities are named after him, including in Semarang, <a href="Malang">Malang</a>, and <a href="Medan">Medan</a>. His grave in Giritunggal is often the site of pilgrimage for Indonesian Catholics, who hold graveside masses.

In June 2012 director <a href="Garin%20Nugroho">Garin Nugroho</a> released a biopic on Soegijapranata entitled "<a href="Soegija">Soegija</a>". Starring <a href="Nirwan%20Dewanto">Nirwan Dewanto</a> in the titular role, the film followed Soegijapranata's activities during the 1940s, amidst a backdrop of the Japanese occupation and the war for Indonesian independence. The film, which had a <a href="Indonesian%20Rupiah">Rp</a> 12 billion (US$1.3 million) budget, sold over 100,000 tickets on its first day. Its launch was accompanied by a semi-fictional novelisation of Soegija's life, written by Catholic author <a href="Ayu%20Utami">Ayu Utami</a>. Several non-fiction biographies of Soegija, by both Catholic and non-Catholic writers, were released concurrently.

In Indonesian popular culture, Soegijapranata is known for his motto "100% Catholic, 100% Indonesian" (). The motto, which has been used to advertise several biographies and the film "Soegija", is derived from Soegijapranata's opening speech at the 1954 All-Indonesia Catholic Congress in Semarang, as follows:

Bougainville counterattack

The Bougainville counterattack (also known as the Second Battle of Torokina) was an unsuccessful Japanese offensive against the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> base at <a href="Cape%20Torokina">Cape Torokina</a>, on <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville Island</a>, during the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Japanese attack began on 8 March 1944 after months of preparation, and was repulsed by <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> forces in fighting which lasted until 25 March. The attack was hampered by inaccurate intelligence and poor planning and was defeated by the well-prepared Allied defenders, who greatly outnumbered the Japanese force. The Japanese suffered severe casualties, while Allied losses were light.

The goal of the offensive was to destroy the Allied <a href="beachhead">beachhead</a>, which accommodated three strategically important airfields. The Japanese wrongly believed that their forces were about as large as the units deployed to defend the Allied positions. The Allies detected Japanese preparations for the attack shortly after they began in early 1944 and strengthened the base's defenses. None of the three Japanese forces which conducted the attack was able to penetrate far into the Allied perimeter, though there was intense fighting for several positions.

The Bougainville counterattack was the last big Japanese offensive in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20Campaign">Solomon Islands Campaign</a>. Following the engagement the Japanese force withdrew from the <a href="Empress%20Augusta%20Bay">Empress Augusta Bay</a> area and only limited fighting took place until late 1944, when Australian troops took over from the Americans and began a series of advances across the island until the end of the war in August 1945.

<a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville Island</a> lies at the northwestern end of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20%28archipelago%29">Solomon Islands archipelago</a>. The island is long and wide at its broadest point. The island is roughly shaped like a <a href="fiddle">fiddle</a>. The interior of Bougainville is dominated by two ranges of mountains which are covered in thick jungle. The coastal plains are swampy and largely covered with mangroves and jungle. Bougainville has a tropical climate, with heavy rain being common at all times of the year. There were two active volcanoes. At the time of World War II, most of Bougainville's population of about 50,000 lived in small settlements in the north of the island and along its north-eastern coast. The area in and around the American perimeter in March 1944 was lightly populated. There were no formed roads, though a track ran along the coast and another crossed the interior.

At the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, Bougainville formed part of the Australian-administrated <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">Mandated Territory of New Guinea</a>. The small number of Australian public servants and plantation managers on Bougainville fled the island in January 1942, and it came under Japanese control that March. Few Japanese troops arrived until 1943, when the island's garrison was expanded to a peak strength of 65,000. By early 1944, the island's native population numbered around 50,000. After their arrival, the Japanese conscripted some of the locals to work as laborers although conditions were harsh and often they were not paid. As the Allied bombing campaign in the Pacific intensified throughout 1943, the conditions imposed on the locals grew more harsh as food supplies dwindled and instances of disease grew.

The Bougainville Campaign began on 1 November 1943 when the United States <a href="I%20Marine%20Amphibious%20Corps">I Marine Amphibious Corps</a> landed at <a href="Cape%20Torokina">Cape Torokina</a>, around <a href="Empress%20Augusta%20Bay">Empress Augusta Bay</a> on the west coast of the Japanese-held island. The Allied invasion aimed to establish a defensive perimeter around Cape Torokina within which airfields would be built to attack the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> and support other operations in the region. The Allies did not intend to conquer the entire island, and the invasion area was mainly selected on the grounds that it was lightly defended and distant from the main Japanese bases at the northern and southern ends of Bougainville.

In addition to the advantages to be gained from distance from the Japanese bases, the American planners judged that a beachhead in the Cape Torokina area would be defensible. The U.S. Marine Corps <a href="official%20history">official history</a> of the fighting on the island states that "the Cape Torokina plain, bordered by the natural obstacles of the <a href="Laruma%20River">Laruma River</a> to the northwest, the mountains inland, and the <a href="Torokina%20River">Torokina River</a> to the south-east, fell into an ideal defensive area about deep and long which could be defended by the Allied forces then available". The planners judged that it would take at least three months for any force which was large enough to pose a threat to the beachhead to reach the area by travelling overland from the Japanese bases. While a Japanese counter-landing could potentially deposit a large force in the Cape Torokina area, the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> was confident that it could stop any such operation.
The Japanese commander on Bougainville, Lieutenant General <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>, initially believed that the landing at Empress Augusta Bay was a diversion, and would be followed by a direct assault on the south of the island. However, he conducted several small and unsuccessful attacks against the <a href="beachhead">beachhead</a> in early November after being ordered to do so by the <a href="Japanese%20Eighth%20Area%20Army">Eighth Area Army</a>, his superior headquarters. These involved units from Hyakutake's <a href="Seventeenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">17th Army</a> and forces dispatched directly from Rabaul. After these attacks were defeated, a local counterattack with four battalions was planned for 22 November, but this plan was scrapped by the Eighth Area Army. The United States forces subsequently expanded their beachhead, and defeated the Japanese in the area in a series of battles in November and December. Most of the Japanese units involved in these engagements were destroyed, but the casualties inflicted on the 17th Army were not crippling; the Americans captured 25 prisoners and a small amount of equipment and estimated that over 2,458 Japanese had been killed.

After pushing the Japanese back, the American forces began work on building defense lines to protect the airfield complex in late November. These defenses were completed by 15 December and comprised <a href="trench">trench</a>es, <a href="Defensive%20fighting%20position">foxholes and fortified emplacements</a> for machine guns and <a href="artillery">artillery</a>. Barbed wire was strung along the horseshoe-shaped perimeter, and fields of fire were cleared ahead of all positions. All trails leading to the area were blocked with obstacles and <a href="land%20mine">land mine</a>s were placed on other routes which might be used by the Japanese. Artillery and <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a> were emplaced in positions where they could support any part of the defensive perimeter, and fire plans were developed to allow for rapid bombardments of all possible approach routes. Several <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a>s were also deployed to illuminate the front lines. An outpost was established around Ibu, to the north of the perimeter, for early warning. The U.S. Army's official history of operations on Bougainville describes the American defenses as "formidable".

The construction of several airfields within the perimeter at Empress Augusta Bay began shortly after the landing. This work was conducted by eight United States Navy <a href="Seabee">Seabee</a> battalions and a <a href="brigade">brigade</a> of engineers from New Zealand. An airfield capable of supporting <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> opened at Cape Torokina on 9 December, and a <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a> of U.S. Marine Corps fighters began operating from it the next day. Two airfields capable of accommodating large numbers of light and medium bombers were subsequently completed: Piva Uncle on 30 December and Piva Yoke on 9 January 1944. These were the closest Allied airfields to Rabaul, and were used to greatly intensify the air campaign against the Japanese positions there. The Japanese air units stationed at Rabaul were worn down by frequent Allied aerial raids during early 1944, and the Japanese high command decided to withdraw them following <a href="Operation%20Hailstone">a major attack</a> on the key base at <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> in mid-February. This gave the Allies complete air superiority over the region.

In late December 1943 Hyakutake and the other senior Japanese officers on Bougainville concluded that the Allies did not intend to advance from their perimeter at Empress Augusta Bay or land elsewhere on the island, and began planning a counterattack. Their plans were based around a mistaken assessment that there were only 30,000 Allied personnel on the island, of whom only 20,000 were combat troops with the remainder aircraft ground crews; the American combat strength was actually over 60,000. As a result of its experiences in the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a> during 1942 and 1943, the 17th Army decided to conduct a single major attack against the perimeter rather than a series of offensives. During a visit to Bougainville on 21 January 1944, General <a href="Hitoshi%20Imamura">Hitoshi Imamura</a>, the commander of the Eighth Area Army, directed that the offensive should be launched in early March. Japanese historian Hiroyuki Shindo states that this date was chosen solely based on ration availability; the Japanese supply line from Rabaul had been cut when the Allies had <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Green%20Islands">captured the Green Islands</a> in mid-February and Japanese commanders wanted to attack before supplies were exhausted.

Preparations for the counterattack were made during the first months of 1944. As the bulk of the 17th Army was stationed in northern and southern Bougainville, engineers needed to develop roads and bridges to allow the troops to move to the hills inland from the American perimeter. The combat troops chosen for the attack spent 40 days throughout January and into February conducting unit level training, perfecting jungle assault techniques. All of the units selected for the offensive departed their bases by mid-February, and advanced along the eastern and western coasts. Barges moved artillery, other equipment and 1,400 soldiers to a point east of Cape Torokina, around the Jaba–Mosigeta area; the guns and supplies were then carried overland into the hills. Only two weeks worth of rations were assembled, although Japanese planners believed these provisions would be sufficient to sustain 12,000 men for about one month.

The Allied force on Bougainville detected the Japanese buildup. Information on the movement of the 17th Army was gained from many sources, including <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a>, patrols conducted by U.S. Army troops into the interior of the island, aerial and naval patrols as well as the interrogation of Japanese prisoners. Japanese troops were also detected around the outpost at Ibu, which was held by the <a href="Fiji%20Infantry%20Regiment">1st Fiji Battalion</a>. In response, Allied aircraft attacked bridges and areas in which Japanese troops were believed to be located. United States Navy <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s and <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Infantry">Landing Craft Infantry</a> <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s supported by <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalina</a> aircraft patrolled the coast of Bougainville and attacked Japanese barges, but were unable to stop the movement of supplies and equipment by sea. American warships and aircraft also periodically bombarded the main Japanese bases on Bougainville.

Several small clashes were fought between Allied and Japanese forces during February. The Fijian force at Ibu was reinforced to a strength of about 400 personnel on 3 February, but was withdrawn to the perimeter in the middle of the month after a larger body of Japanese troops surrounded the outpost and began to attack the U.S. Army units which were protecting its supply lines. All of the Fijian troops, along with 200 Bougainvillean civilians who had chosen to evacuate with them, reached the coast on 19 February. Other American patrols and positions to the north and north-east of the perimeter were also attacked, and the Allies concluded that the Japanese force was being concentrated in this area. Papers taken from the bodies of Japanese soldiers killed in this fighting also allowed the Allies to build up an accurate appreciation of the Japanese plan of attack as well as the <a href="order%20of%20battle">order of battle</a> of the forces involved. Intelligence information detailing the Japanese plans was then distributed to American soldiers holding the perimeter through various means, including notices posted on unit bulletin boards.

The Japanese force was drawn primarily from Lieutenant General <a href="Masatane%20Kanda">Masatane Kanda</a>'s <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">6th Division</a>, a veteran formation that had seen action previously in China, although there were also elements (two battalions) of the <a href="17th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">17th Division</a>. These troops were divided into three separate groups which were named for their commander, as well as an artillery group and a reserve force. Major General <a href="Iwasa%20Shun">Iwasa Shun</a> commanded the Iwasa Unit, which comprised the <a href="23rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">23rd Infantry Regiment</a>, the 2nd Battalion of the <a href="13th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">13th Infantry Regiment</a>, two batteries of artillery as well as engineers and other support troops. The Magata Unit was commanded by Colonel Magata Isaoshi and was made up of the <a href="45th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">45th Infantry Regiment</a> along with supporting artillery, mortars and engineers. Colonel Muda Toyoharei led the Muda Unit, which comprised the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 13th Infantry Regiment and some engineers. The 17th Army Artillery Group was commanded by Colonel Saito and was equipped with four <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s, two <a href="Type%2091%2010%20cm%20howitzer">howitzers</a>, eighteen <a href="Type%2092%20battalion%20gun">infantry guns</a> and a large number of <a href="mountain%20gun">mountain gun</a>s; an American post-battle account stated that the group had 168 of these weapons. The 17th Army's reserve comprised part of the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the <a href="53rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">53rd Infantry Regiment</a> as well as elements of the <a href="81st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">81st Infantry Regiment</a>. According to U.S. Army official historian John Miller, the total number of men in the attacking force was either 15,400 or 19,000, although Shindo states that only 9,548 were directly committed to the fighting. The Japanese did not have any air support, as it had been diverted to make up for losses on Truk. Similarly, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> was unable to provide any assistance. The Japanese did, however, hold the high ground overlooking the perimeter around Torokina, giving them the ability to observe the US dispositions.
The U.S. Army <a href="XIV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XIV Corps</a>, under the command of Major General <a href="Oscar%20Griswold">Oscar Griswold</a>, had taken over responsibility for the Torokina perimeter from the Marines in mid-December 1943. They greatly outnumbered the Japanese force, and enjoyed much stronger artillery support. At the time of the attack, the corps had a total strength of 62,000 men. It comprised two divisions and a large number of support units; both of the divisions were veteran units which had seen combat elsewhere in the Solomon Islands. The <a href="23rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">Americal Division</a>, under Major General <a href="John%20R.%20Hodge">John R. Hodge</a>, held the eastern portion of the perimeter, and was made up of the <a href="132nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">132nd</a>, <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">164th</a> and <a href="182nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">182nd Infantry Regiments</a>. The remainder of the perimeter was defended by Major General <a href="Robert%20S.%20Beightler">Robert S. Beightler</a>'s <a href="37th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">37th Infantry Division</a>, whose main elements were the <a href="129th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">129th</a>, <a href="145th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">145th</a> and <a href="148th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">148th Infantry Regiments</a>. Almost all of the infantry regiments on the perimeter had been assigned additional machine guns, and each regiment received a battery of <a href="M116%20howitzer">75 mm pack howitzers</a> on 3 March. The support units available to the corps included the <a href="754th%20Tank%20Battalion">754th Tank Battalion</a>, <a href="Marine%20defense%20battalions">3rd Marine Defense Battalion</a>, <a href="82nd%20Chemical%20Battalion">82nd Chemical Battalion</a> (which was equipped with mortars), the 1st Battalion of the <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">24th Infantry Regiment</a> (an <a href="Military%20history%20of%20African%20Americans">African American unit</a> which was mainly being used for laboring), the 1st Fiji Battalion and several engineer units. U.S. Army and Navy and <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a> (RNZAF) security units were deployed within the perimeter to protect the airfields from attack.

XIV Corps did not have its own corps artillery, but <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> Leo Kreber, the 37th Division's senior artillery officer, was appointed to command all of the artillery units within the perimeter, including the eight battalions which formed part of the infantry divisions. Six of these units were equipped with <a href="M101%20howitzer">howitzers</a> and the other two operated short-ranged <a href="Canon%20de%20155%20C%20mod%C3%A8le%201917%20Schneider">howitzers</a>. A provisional corps artillery unit was also formed which comprised two batteries of long-ranged <a href="155%20mm%20Long%20Tom">155 mm "Long Tom" guns</a> from the <a href="3rd%20Defense%20Battalion">3rd Defense Battalion</a> and eight batteries of <a href="90%20mm%20Gun%20M1/M2/M3">anti-aircraft guns</a> from the <a href="251st%20Air%20Defense%20Artillery%20Regiment">251st Anti-aircraft Artillery Regiment</a> and the marine defense battalion. In February the 2nd Battalion, <a href="44th%20Air%20Defense%20Artillery%20Regiment">54th Coast Artillery Regiment</a>, arrived to augment the XIV Corps' artillery. This became the first African American unit to see combat in the South Pacific.

The American troops were supported by air and naval units. The U.S. Navy force assigned to the island comprised the six <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s of <a href="Destroyer%20Squadron%2022">Destroyer Squadron 22</a>, a squadron of PT boats, a small number of Landing Craft Infantry fitted as gunboats and several armed <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a>. Most of the air units on Bougainville were drawn from the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Air%20Wing">1st Marine Air Wing</a>, which had 64 <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">SBD Dauntless</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s and 32 <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">TBF Avenger</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s available for ground support tasks. Two RNZAF fighter squadrons were also stationed at Bougainville.

The Japanese offensive plans specified that the three units would make a series of coordinated, but separate, attacks on the American perimeter. These involved capturing strategically significant hills within the perimeter, and then assaulting the airfields. The Iwasa Unit would begin the offensive by advancing southwest and capturing Hill 700, in the center of the U.S. perimeter, on 8 March. It would then rest for two days before advancing against the Piva airfields. The Muda Unit was to launch its attack on the right of the perimeter 10 March by advancing west and capturing Hills 260 and 309. On 12 March it and a battalion from the Iwasa Unit would capture Hill 608. The attack would then switch to the left, and the Magata Unit would begin its attack on 11 March and move south through low-lying terrain to assault the 129th Infantry Regiment. After defeating this unit, the Magata Unit would join the Iwasa Unit's advance on the airfields. Once these airfields were secured, the three units would advance to Cape Torokina, and capture it by 17 March. Due to their inadequate supply of rations, the Japanese needed to achieve a rapid victory.

The American perimeter was strengthened ahead of the attack. The size of the perimeter had been expanded slightly since late 1943, and was now long. The defensive positions along the front line were further developed, and reserve positions were constructed. An outpost to the east of the perimeter on Hill 260 was held both as an artillery <a href="observation%20post">observation post</a> and to prevent the Japanese from using it for the same purpose. The only weaknesses in the American position were that the number of troops and artillery available were smaller than what the U.S. Army would normally use to defend a perimeter of that length, and the Japanese held hills which overlooked almost all of the perimeter.

The Japanese attack was focused on three separate areas around the U.S.-held perimeter: Hill 700 in the center, Hill 260 in the south and around Taylor's and Cox's Creeks in the north. The offensive began with an artillery bombardment on 8 March. At 05:45 hours Japanese artillery began firing into the beachhead; the Piva airfields were the main targets of this shelling, and three aircraft were destroyed and 19 damaged. The Americans quickly located the Japanese guns, and their artillery began <a href="counter-battery%20fire">counter-battery fire</a>. U.S. Navy destroyers provided fire support from their anchorage in Empress Augusta Bay, and American aircraft bombed several of the hills outside the perimeter. As a result of the bombardment, all aircraft based at the Piva airfields other than six TBFs were moved to the nearby island of <a href="New%20Georgia">New Georgia</a>. The next day Japanese artillery targeted the fighter strip at Torokina. Few shells landed on the American front-line positions on either day. All of the U.S. and New Zealand fighter units on Bougainville operated from Torokina throughout the Japanese offensive, though they were sent to nearby islands each evening to ensure that they were not attacked on the ground. Each day, American SBD and TBF aircraft flew more than 100 sorties over Bougainville in direct support of the ground troops, and USMC and RNZAF fighter bombers attacked Japanese supply lines.

While the Iwasa Unit arrived at its attack position on 8 March, its assault on the American perimeter was delayed until the next day. Hill 700, in the 37th Division's sector, was held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the U.S. Army's 145th Infantry Regiment. Very steep, with a deep saddle between two knolls, Hill 700 proved difficult to both defend and to attack. For several days prior to the attack there had been clashes between U.S. and Japanese patrols in the front of the position, and Japanese patrols had been engaged in wire cutting around the perimeter. Several small skirmishes were fought between these units and elements of the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment on 8 March, and the 37th Division's artillery bombarded areas from where the Japanese could potentially launch an attack on the 2nd Battalion, 145th Infantry. The 23rd Infantry Regiment belatedly began to attack just after midnight on 9 March amidst heavy rain, but failed to penetrate far into the American defenses. After daybreak on 9 March, elements of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 145th Infantry Regiment counterattacked the Japanese, and regained most of the terrain which had been lost. Two <a href="M3%20Stuart">M3 Stuart</a> tanks from the 754th Tank Battalion supported the attack but proved ineffective due to the steep terrain. Meanwhile, the Japanese took advantage of the terrain to bring machine gun and mortar fire down on the U.S. supply route dubbed McClelland Road. Two American destroyers provided fire support for the U.S. Army forces, and fired a total of 400 rounds during the day. As night fell, forward movement largely ceased. Both sides maintained a defensive posture throughout the night, exchanging small arms and indirect fire.

The Iwasa Unit attacked again at 06:45 hours on 10 March, but did not make any progress. Its attack was repelled by heavy indirect fire, as well as small arms fire. U.S. forces then prepared a counterattack, and were reorganized to do so throughout the afternoon. Meanwhile, airstrikes were carried out on Japanese positions by 36 aircraft. At 17:00 hours parts of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 145th Regiment launched a well-coordinated attack, and managed to recapture more of the area lost on 9 March. The remaining men of the Iwasa Unit conducted an offensive against Hill 700 on the night of 10/11 March, but only managed to capture a single <a href="bunker">bunker</a>. Further Japanese attacks on the morning of 11 March were unsuccessful.

Beightler, the commander of the 37th Division, was frustrated by the 145th Infantry's failure to reestablish its original perimeter, and reinforced the regiment on 11 March with the 2nd Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment. During that day the commander of the 145th Infantry, Colonel Cecil Whitcomb, was also relieved of command after Beightler learned that he was suffering from extreme combat fatigue. Following an artillery bombardment, elements of the 2nd Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment attacked Japanese positions during the afternoon and captured some ground. This battalion made further progress against Japanese-held bunkers the next day, and recaptured the original perimeter lines. The Iwasa Unit began to withdraw on 13 March. The Japanese had suffered heavy losses during the fighting around Hill 700, and the Americans counted 309 bodies near the area recaptured on 11 and 12 March; two prisoners were also taken. The 37th Division's fatalities amounted to five officers and 73 enlisted men.

Hill 260 was located in the Americal Division's sector, about outside the main perimeter line, on the southern approaches to the Torokina perimeter. An <a href="hourglass">hourglass</a>-shaped feature consisting of two rounded hills to the north and south – dubbed "North Knob" and "South Knob" – the position was essentially a <a href="saddle%20%28geology%29">saddle</a>, albeit one separated by a very narrow handle. The U.S. forces had established an outpost on the feature which was occupied by a reinforced <a href="platoon">platoon</a> from G Company, 2nd Battalion, 182nd Regiment and a party of artillery observers; the total strength of this isolated force on 10 March was about 80 men. An observation platform had been erected up a tree (called "OP tree"), and the heavily forested hill was protected by a network of bunkers which had been constructed out of sandbags and logs. During the night of 9/10 March small parties from the Muda Unit, having assembled at Peko before moving along the East–West Trail, infiltrated the gap between Hill 260 and the main American perimeter and the main body of the Japanese force moved into its jumping off position east of the hill. During the night American artillery also bombarded the approaches to the southern end of the hill.

Japanese forces began their attack on Hill 260 shortly after 06:00 hours on 10 March, with the intention of using it to launch follow-up attacks on Hills 309 and 608, inside the U.S. perimeter. The initial assault was made by all or part of the 3rd Battalion, 13th Infantry Regiment and captured the area around the OP tree. Upon being informed of the attack, Griswold ordered that Hill 260 be held at all costs; up to this time the Americal Division's headquarters had not planned to retain the position. E and F Companies of the 2nd Battalion, 182nd Infantry Regiment were subsequently dispatched to the hill. Most of F Company reinforced the survivors of G Company on Hill 260, and E Company and a platoon from F Company counterattacked to retake the lost ground. The American infantrymen regained some ground, but suffered heavy casualties from Japanese fire and exhaustion before the attack was broken off in the evening of 10 March. The Japanese attacked E Company early in the morning of 11 March, but were beaten back. G Company (less its platoon in defensive positions) attempted to relieve E Company later that day, but also came under attack. B Company of the 182nd Infantry Regiment was moved forward to assist the other two companies in breaking contact with the Japanese forces and retiring to the main perimeter on Hill 260's North Knob, and this was successfully achieved during the morning.
The assistant U.S. divisional commander, Brigadier General William A. McCulloch, arrived in the afternoon to direct the battle on Hill 260. Reinforcements in the form of <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a> teams from the 132nd Infantry Regiment also arrived. In the afternoon American forces attempted to regain the South Knob. While this effort was initially successful and led to the extraction of several American soldiers who had been isolated on the position, by late afternoon the U.S. units had been forced to withdraw to the North Knob. The fighting on Hill 260 died down in the evening of 11 March as neither the Japanese nor U.S. forces attempted any offensive action. Muda took the opportunity to concentrate his forces to fully occupy the South Knob, and several bunkers were established overnight.

Japanese indirect fire opened the fighting early on 12 March, falling across the Americal Division's front. U.S. artillery and mortars fired back, targeting the Muda Unit on the South Knob. Such was the proximity of their position to the U.S. defenders on the North Knob, that the Americans there were forced to take cover from their own artillery. With supplies on the North Knob running low, efforts were made by U.S. troops to bring ammunition, food and water forward; this required soldiers to carry the heavy loads forward under fire. The carrying parties were supported by covering fire from protection parties. By midday, a sufficient quantity of supplies had been brought forward for the Americans to launch an attack. This involved one <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> (A Company, 1st Battalion, 182nd Infantry Regiment) providing supporting fire from the North Knob while another (B Company, 1st Battalion, 182nd Infantry Regiment) carried out a flanking move to attack the South Knob from the west with flamethrowers and indirect fire support. After initial gains, this attack was held up. In an effort to hold the ground that had been gained, a third company (A Company, 1st Battalion, 132nd Infantry Regiment) was dispatched to reinforce B Company, but it too came under heavy fire and was held up. As a result, B Company had to be withdrawn back to the North Knob for the night. As local U.S. commanders calculated the cost of continuing to hold Hill 260, the Americal Division sought permission to withdraw, but this was refused by the XIV Corps headquarters.

The U.S. forces made further attempts to secure Hill 260 on 13 March, but several attacks were defeated after the American troops crested the South Knob. As casualties mounted, McCulloch resolved to abandon the direct approach, instead deciding that he would seek to wear down the defenders on the South Knob after patrols discovered that the Japanese had no reserves left to reinforce the position. From this it was assessed that their effort in the sector had been spent and regardless of whether they managed to hold the South Knob, they would be unable to exploit the position further. This assessment was correct, as the Japanese had begun transferring troops from this sector to reinforce the Magata Unit around the northern perimeter. It was hoped that these transfers would concentrate enough force to achieve a break-in. Consequently, only a small Japanese force remained on the South Knob. Over the following days this force was subjected to heavy bombardment and flame attacks, which lasted until the Japanese withdrew from the position on 27 March. Casualties in the Hill 260 sector amounted to 98 U.S. servicemen killed, 24 missing, and 581 wounded. A total of 560 Japanese dead were found on top of the South Knob when the U.S. forces reoccupied it on 28 March.

The Magata Unit approached Cape Torokina from the north by moving along the Logging Trail, which had been built by U.S. engineers and entered the northwestern sector of the perimeter near Taylor's Creek. Between 11 and 17 March troops from the Magata Unit attacked the positions occupied by the U.S. 129th Infantry Regiment in the vicinity of Cox's and Taylor's Creeks east of the Numa Numa Trail in the 37th Division's sector. Following the commencement of the Japanese counterattack in the central and southern sectors on 8/9 March, the northern perimeter came under bombardment from Japanese indirect fire. There were several small scale actions, but initially no major engagements, between U.S. and Japanese patrols. On 11 March, the main elements of the Magata Unit concentrated around their assembly area on Mount Nampei in preparation for an assault. As they began advancing south-west, the U.S. outposts were withdrawn and heavy barrages of fire were laid down in front of the American positions. By early evening the two forces were engaged in a heavy exchange of fire along the Logging Trail, which lasted until darkness had fallen. Throughout the night, small parties of Japanese troops attempted to infiltrate the American positions, cutting the wire in several places and successfully capturing several bunkers around the junction of Taylor's Creek and the Logging Trail, as well as several more further to the east.

Throughout the following day, the U.S. forces attempted to retake the lost positions to restore the integrity of their line. Fighting raged into the early afternoon, by which time the Americans had recaptured several bunkers. In the evening, the Americans used indirect fire and searchlights to harass the Japanese. Their attack recommenced just before dawn the next morning, and recaptured another bunker. As morning progressed, the U.S. commander requested tank support, and four tanks from the 754th Tank Battalion were dispatched. In the meantime, minor counterattacks regained part of the line; by mid-morning the tanks joined the fighting and several more positions were retaken by the U.S. troops in several attacks before and after lunch. Having run out of ammunition and running low on fuel, the first group of tanks was withdrawn and replaced with a fresh platoon with which the attack was resumed in the mid-afternoon. Fighting continued throughout the day until 19:30 hours when the Japanese retired from the position for the evening, having been forced to give up all of their earlier gains.
Although there were minor exchanges of fire and some patrol activity, there was a lull in the battle on 14 March in the northern sector. The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the U.S. positions before dawn. They gained some ground around Cox's Creek, but U.S. forces counterattacked with air support, <a href="bazooka">bazooka</a>s and flamethrowers, and retook part of the line. A platoon of <a href="M4%20Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> tanks arrived during the afternoon. At around 15:00 hours the tanks attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained more of the perimeter. From there, the battle followed a similar pattern, with a lull in the fighting on 16 March, followed by a 
re-newed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several U.S. positions being overrun.

At this point, the Japanese commanders decided to concentrate their efforts in the northern sector along the frontage held by the 129th Infantry Regiment. They began moving the Iwasa and Muda Units to link up with the Magata Unit, in order to launch an all-out assault aimed at reaching the airfields. This movement was not completed until 23 March, by which time the Japanese had concentrated around 4,850 troops. Fighting was limited to patrol actions in the intervening period during which time the defending U.S. troops worked to improve the perimeter defenses. A general attack began after sundown that day with shelling and skirmishes prior to a series of assaults through the low ground. This proved the final element of the Japanese counterattack. Forewarned by captured plans, the U.S. troops had been expecting the attack. A heavy American artillery barrage fell on the main Japanese assault forces as they formed up, and disrupted their advance by inflicting heavy casualties. Nevertheless, the Japanese captured a number of forward positions. In the daylight on 24 March, U.S. troops launched a strong counterattack, supported by tanks and seven artillery battalions, after large numbers of reserves were poured in to the sector. Casualties amongst the Japanese were heavy. Air attacks fell on the Iwasa Unit's rear area and amidst intense fighting, a battalion of the Japanese 45th Infantry Regiment was completely destroyed, while another from the 53rd almost suffered the same fate. This offensive halted the Japanese for good. Finally, Hyakutake called an end to the operation. As the Japanese began to withdraw, Fijian troops and U.S. soldiers from Griswold's reserve pursued the withdrawing troops on 25 March.

As well as providing fire support for Army units, the U.S. Navy forces at Bougainville sought to prevent other Japanese offensives throughout the battle. Four destroyers bombarded Japanese supply dumps and troop concentrations near the mouth of the Reini River to the east of the perimeter every day between 3 and 16 March. As it was believed that the Japanese would attempt to use barges to land a force inside the perimeter, the destroyers and PT boats stationed at Bougainville patrolled along the coast of Empress Augusta Bay each night. U.S. Navy Seabees also manned several of the defensive positions which had been established along beaches within the perimeter.

The counterattack drew to a close on 27 March, as Hyakutake gave the order for his forces to cease the attack and withdraw. As they began to move, elements of the Japanese 6th Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 4th South Seas Garrison Unit, acted as a screening force to cover their movement. The next day Hill 260 was retaken by American troops. Meanwhile, the Japanese withdrew, largely in an orderly fashion, to the positions they had occupied prior to the battle. In the following weeks, the U.S. forces expanded their perimeter, and harassed the Japanese. This operation sought to occupy key terrain and establish outposts and blocking positions along potential Japanese avenues of advance. It involved the African American troops of the 24th Infantry Regiment and <a href="93rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">93rd Infantry Division</a> who were committed to battle to gain combat experience.
Figures for Japanese casualties during the attack differ. The U.S. Army's official history, which was published in 1959, puts Japanese losses at "over 5,000 men killed, more than 3,000 wounded". In contrast, Australian historian Karl James wrote in 2012 that "the Japanese estimated that they lost 3,500 men killed and another 5,500 wounded" and noted that many of the wounded subsequently died from starvation or disease, Shindo stated in 2016 that of those directly involved in the battle 2,700 were killed; however, he provides total figures of 5,400 dead and 7,100 wounded, which include units other than the 6th Division involved in fighting around the same time. Shindo's figures of 12,500 killed or wounded over this period are also supported by Kengoro Tanaka. Several units were disbanded due to these losses, and morale among the surviving Japanese personnel on Bougainville slumped.

Allied losses were much lighter. The U.S. Army official history states that XIV Corps suffered 263 fatalities. A monograph prepared by the Office of the U.S. Army's Surgeon General in 1962 puts the total Allied casualties on Bougainville between 15 February and 21 April 1944 as 2,335. These included 395 deaths and 1,940 men wounded.

In summing up the counterattack, U.S. Army official historian John Miller argues that the Japanese offensive failed due to poor planning and intelligence. The Japanese commanders underestimated the strength of the U.S. defenders, who greatly outnumbered them and had far superior artillery support. Even if XIV Corps had been as weak as the Japanese believed, the force committed to the attack did not include enough troops or artillery to penetrate the well-prepared defenses. Miller argues further that the attack might have achieved a degree of success, at least in terms of inflicting heavy casualties on the U.S. forces, had Hyakutake concentrated his forces prior to the attack, rather than building them up over the course of the fighting. This would have potentially produced a break in the U.S. line, which the Japanese might have been able to exploit to penetrate into the rear areas and cause considerable destruction before the U.S. forces regrouped. This did not happen, and the veteran U.S. troops held their positions. Miller opines that had the offensive been successful, it would have had a serious effect on the campaign in the Solomons, resulting in a large drain on Allied resources, but would most likely not have altered the wider course of the war.

<a href="Samuel%20Eliot%20Morison">Samuel Eliot Morison</a>, the official historian of the U.S. Navy in World War II, reached similar conclusions. He judged that while a successful attack on the airfields would have "cut the most important link in the Allied armed chain around Rabaul", the Japanese offensive failed due to the strength of the Allied defenses and the determined resistance put up by the garrison. In his analysis Morison also highlighted the advantages the Allies gained from having air and naval superiority at Bougainville. Regardless of the reasons the counterattack failed, Shindo contends that the Japanese commanders never believed they would be successful in recapturing Bougainville. This is supported by Tanaka who wrote that Imamura's decision to attack had been based upon a desire to make "some contribution to general military situation", and to attack while they still could, rather than an assessment that they could force the Allies to withdraw from Bougainville.

After the defeat of the counterattack and the brief U.S. pursuit that followed in April, the focus of Japanese operations on Bougainville turned largely to subsistence. The incidence of illness began to rise as a result of the severance of the supply line from Rabaul. In contrast, the Allied base at Torokina grew considerably, eventually stretching along the coast, and inland. Well stocked with supplies, equipment and amenities, including medical and recreation facilities, it became a symbol of Allied power and wealth that was used to impress the local Bougainvilleans. The U.S. forces on the island assumed a largely defensive posture following the defeat of the Japanese attack, with the perimeter around Torokina being further fortified. Apart from limited patrolling, the Americans did not pursue an offensive campaign throughout 1944, preferring to contain the Japanese rather than attempting to destroy them. This situation began to change in late 1944, when the Australian <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a>, under the command of Lieutenant General <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a>, started to relieve the U.S. forces, who were transferred to the <a href="Philippines%20campaign%20%281944-45%29">Philippines</a>. After taking over the U.S. base around Torokina, the Australians subsequently began a three-pronged offensive to secure the island, with heavy fighting taking place from December 1944 until close to the end of the war. Major actions were fought around <a href="Battle%20of%20Slater%27s%20Knoll">Slater's Knoll</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsimba%20Ridge">Tsimba Ridge</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Porton%20Plantation">Porton Plantation</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Ratsua">Ratsua</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Hongorai%20River">along the Hongorai River</a>.

History of Liverpool F.C. (1959–85)

The history of <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool Football Club</a> from 1959 to 1985 covers the period from the appointment of <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> as <a href="List%20of%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20managers">manager</a> of the then <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> club, to the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a> and its aftermath.

Overhauling the team during his first year at Liverpool, Shankly released 24 players and converted a <a href="The%20Boot%20Room">boot storage room</a> into a meeting place where he and his coaches discussed strategy. They won the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Football%20League">1961–62</a> Second Division title and were <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promoted</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>. Two seasons later, Liverpool won their first League title since <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Football%20League">1946–47</a>, thereby qualifying for Liverpool's first <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%20in%20European%20football">participation in UEFA competition</a>. The following season, Liverpool won their first <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. Further League titles followed in <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Football%20League">1965–66</a> and <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Football%20League">1972–73</a>. 1973 brought their first European trophy, the <a href="1972-73%20UEFA%20Cup">1972-73 UEFA Cup</a>. The following season, Shankly's last, they won the FA Cup again.

Shankly's assistant <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a> took over in 1974. His <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Football%20League">first season</a> in charge was trophiless before winning the League title and UEFA Cup the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League">following season</a>. Three <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>s and four League titles followed before Paisley retired at the end of <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League">1982–83</a>. His assistant, <a href="Joe%20Fagan">Joe Fagan</a>, took over.

Liverpool won a trophy treble during Fagan's first season as manager, winning the League title for the third straight year, the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> for the fourth straight year and a fourth European Cup. The following season, the club was involved in one of the worst football stadium disasters. Before the start of the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Final</a> versus <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. This tragedy, the Heysel Stadium disaster, caused a five-year UEFA competition expulsion of English clubs.

<a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> was appointed <a href="List%20of%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20managers">Liverpool manager</a> on 1 December 1959. Shankly was approached at <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> by <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> chairman Tom Williams, who asked if Shankly would like to manage "the best club in the country". Shankly replied, "Why, is <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a> packing up?" Liverpool's potential and the lack of ambition Shankly perceived at Huddersfield led him to accept. When he joined Liverpool the club had been in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> since <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Football%20League">1953–54</a> <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a>. In his first season Shankly debuted <a href="Ian%20Callaghan">Ian Callaghan</a>, the club's future record appearance holder, and <a href="Roger%20Hunt">Roger Hunt</a>, the club's future record League goalscorer.

The club finished third outside the promotion spots in Shankly's first part-season (1959/60). He released 24 players at the season's end. As well as Callaghan and Hunt he also retained <a href="Gerry%20Byrne%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201938%29">Gerry Byrne</a>. Shankly recognising the abilities of the existing coaching team of <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>, <a href="Joe%20Fagan">Joe Fagan</a> and <a href="Reuben%20Bennett">Reuben Bennett</a> retained all three. An Anfield boot storage room was adopted as a strategy discussion venue by him and his coaches. <a href="The%20Boot%20Room">The Boot Room</a>, as it became known, became integral to their success. <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a> remarked, "You got a more wide-ranging discussion in the Boot Room than the boardroom. What went on was kept within those four walls. There was a certain mystique about the place."

They again finished third the following 1960/61 season. Despite a 14-game run without loss, 5 defeats in the opening 11 matches cost Liverpool promotion. Shareholder <a href="John%20Moores%20%28British%20businessman%29">John Moores</a> felt the club needed to spend more money on players to be successful and encouraged chairman T. V. Williams to do so. That summer of 1961 Shankly signed <a href="Ian%20St%20John">Ian St John</a> from <a href="Motherwell%20F.C.">Motherwell</a> and <a href="Ron%20Yeats">Ron Yeats</a> from <a href="Dundee%20United%20F.C.">Dundee United</a>. ‘Take a walk around my centre-half, gentlemen, he’s a colossus!’ Shankly said to the press conference when announcing Yeats’ arrival. Shankly confidently challenged the board of directors to "sack me if they can't play." St John and Yeats in their first season helped win promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>; Unbeaten at home all season, they won the Second Division with 62 points.

Liverpool were back in the First Division for the first time in eight years in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Football%20League">1962–63</a>. Liverpool won only four and lost seven of their first 14 games back in the top flight. Shankly responded by signing <a href="Willie%20Stevenson">Willie Stevenson</a> at left half. They were up to fifth by March 1963 after 13 unbeaten matches. After their 1–0 FA Cup semi-final loss to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>, poor results including a 7–2 loss to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> led to finishing eighth.

In summer of 1963 Shankly signed <a href="Peter%20Thompson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201942%29">Peter Thompson</a> from <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> to play on the right side of midfield. In October he debuted <a href="Tommy%20Lawrence">Tommy Lawrence</a> who dominated the club's goalkeeping for the rest of the decade. Liverpool started <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Football%20League">1963–64</a> poorly, taking only nine points from the first nine games. Their 2–1 first <a href="Merseyside%20derby">Merseyside derby</a> win over <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> since 1950 initiated moving up the table. They won 47 points from their next 30 games securing their sixth League title and their first qualification for <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%20in%20European%20football">UEFA competition</a>. Success increased Anfield's average attendance above 50,000. Increasingly vocal fans adopted <a href="You%27ll%20Never%20Walk%20Alone">You'll Never Walk Alone</a> as their anthem.

Shankly changed the team <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> for their <a href="1964-65%20European%20Cup">1964-65 European Cup</a> second round tie versus <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">R.S.C. Anderlecht</a>. He felt the players in the new all-red would appear more intimidating than in the previous red shirts, white shorts and white socks. Liverpool lost in the semi-final to <a href="Inter%20Milan">Internazionale</a>. Shankly felt the referee biased allowing questionable Italian goals. In the <a href="1965%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1965 FA Cup Final</a> Hunt put Liverpool ahead in <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>. <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>'s <a href="Billy%20Bremner">Billy Bremner</a> equalised. St John then scored for a 2–1 first ever Liverpool FA Cup triumph. Defence of their League title ended in seventh place.

The <a href="1966%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1966 European Cup Winners' Cup Final</a> was 1–1 after 90 minutes. <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> won 2–1 after extra time. Shankly stated afterwards, "We didn't play well and we gave away two silly goals." Their FA Cup defence ended in the third round to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. They regained the League title on the last day of April 1966 with two Hunt goals to beat Chelsea . Yeats matched <a href="Alex%20Raisbeck">Alex Raisbeck</a> and <a href="Donald%20MacKinlay">Donald MacKinlay</a> as double league title winning, Scottish Liverpool captains.

Liverpool exited <a href="Ajax%205%E2%80%931%20Liverpool%20%281966%29">7–3 on aggregate</a> to <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>'s <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> in the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20European%20Cup">1966–67 European Cup</a> second round. They finished fifth in the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Football%20League">1966–67 Football League</a> winning only 2 of their last 11 games.

Liverpool were league leaders through much of September, October and November 1967. Playing 59 games all season, they were unable to sustain a domestic nor <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> challenge. They finished third in the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Football%20League">1967–68 Football League</a> behind champions <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Their furthest progress that season in three knock-out trophies was the FA Cup quarter-final.

Poor performances in the 1968/69 cup competitions meant Liverpool had less fixture congestion than the previous season. They finished second in the <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Football%20League">1968–69 Football League</a> six points behind <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>. Left back, <a href="Gerry%20Byrne%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201938%29">Gerry Byrne</a>, retired after 333 appearances and 12 seasons. Shankly started replacing ageing players in his squad, purchasing future captain <a href="Emlyn%20Hughes">Emlyn Hughes</a> and goalkeeper <a href="Ray%20Clemence">Ray Clemence</a> the season before. <a href="Tony%20Hateley">Tony Hateley</a> joined for a club record fee of £96,000 from Chelsea, but transferred after a year to <a href="Coventry%20City">Coventry City</a> after injury and poor form. Mid-season Shankly signed <a href="Alun%20Evans">Alun Evans</a> from <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> for a then record £100,000 fee for a teenager. After a good start, Evans' career was curtailed by injuries.

Liverpool were unbeaten in their first ten <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Football%20League">1969–70 Football League</a> matches until a 1–0 loss to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. A sixth-round FA Cup loss at second division <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> convinced Shankly to move on older players. <a href="Bobby%20Graham%20%28footballer%29">Bobby Graham</a> had already replaced Hunt as the main striker. St John and Yeats also made their last Liverpool appearances. Liverpool exited in the early rounds of the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> and League Cup and finished fifth in the league behind champions Everton.

In <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Football%20League">1970–71</a> players such as Clemence, Hughes, <a href="Alec%20Lindsay">Alec Lindsay</a>, <a href="Larry%20Lloyd">Larry Lloyd</a> and <a href="Steve%20Heighway">Steve Heighway</a> reduced the average age of the team to 22. 21 year old <a href="John%20Toshack">John Toshack</a> signed in November from <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> for a club record £110,000 to spearhead the attack. His first Liverpool goal was 11 days later in a 3-2 derby comeback win after being two down to Everton. Liverpool had a second consecutive fifth place league finish. They exited the <a href="1970-71%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1970-71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> semi-finals to Leeds United. <a href="Brian%20Hall%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201946%29">Brian Hall</a>'s goal clinched a <a href="1970-71%20FA%20Cup">1970-71 FA Cup</a> 2-1 comeback semi final over Everton. Heighway put Liverpool ahead in extra time in the final. Arsenal this time came back to win 2–1 for a Gunners League and cup double.

Shankly signed 20 year old <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> from <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a> on 10 May 1971. On his full debut in the <a href="1971-72%20Football%20League">1971-72 Football League</a> Keegan scored after 12 minutes. This was the first of 100 Keegan Liverpool goals and a successful strike partnership with Toshack. 18 year old <a href="Phil%20Thompson">Phil Thompson</a> debuted as a substitute in a 3-0 <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a> win over Manchester United. Liverpool contesting a four-way title fight lost 1-0 in their penultimate game at <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a>'s <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> who had now completed their fixtures. On Monday 8 May 1972, Leeds' 2-1 loss at <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> gave Liverpool their bite at the title. Needing to win the same evening if Leeds lost, Liverpool drew 0-0 at Arsenal with Shankly furious an 88th minute Toshack goal was disallowed. Derby stayed top.

In July 1972 <a href="Peter%20Cormack">Peter Cormack</a> signed from <a href="Nottingham%20Forest">Nottingham Forest</a> equaling the record £110,000 fee Liverpool paid for John Toshack. Shankly described Cormack's signature as, 'The final piece in the jigsaw' of that team. In the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1972–73 season</a> they duly won the League and the club's first European trophy, the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. Cormack and Keegan scored in a 2-0 Easter Monday showdown with title rivals, <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a>'s Leeds United. Fellow title contenders Arsenal only drew at Southampton the same day. Liverpool needing a final game draw for the title drew 0-0 at home versus <a href="Leicester%20City">Leicester City</a>. Their eighth League title equalled the record held by Arsenal and was their first captained by a non-Scot, <a href="Tommy%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201945%29">Tommy Smith</a>. A <a href="1973%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">1973 UEFA Cup Final</a> downpour meant the home first leg was abandoned after 27 minutes. Shankly in those 27 minutes felt the <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> defence was suspect in the air. Shankly started tall forward, John Toshack, in the re-arranged game demoting the small build of Brian Hall to a substitute appearance in a 3-0 win. Toshack headed assists for two Keegan strikes with Lloyd also heading a goal. A 2–0 second leg, away loss meant Liverpool won 3–2 on aggregate. They were the first English team to win the League and a UEFA competition in the same season.

<a href="John%20Smith%20%28businessman%29">John Smith</a> became chairman in 1973 with his business experience to build a more corporate view for the club. He ended the club's policy of changing chairmen every three years. In 1973 the old Main Stand was demolished and replaced with official opening by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. They exited to Yugoslav team <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> in the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20European%20Cup">1973–74 European Cup</a> second round. Their <a href="1973-74%20Football%20League">1973-74 Football League</a> campaign was bookended with poor results (in contrast to champions Leeds United unbeaten in their first league 29 games). Liverpool finished second. A second FA Cup win came with two goals by Keegan and one by Heighway in the <a href="1974%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1974 FA Cup Final</a> beating <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> 3–0. <a href="Ray%20Kennedy">Ray Kennedy</a>'s end of season transfer from Arsenal was Shankly's last act as Liverpool manager. He resigned citing the need for a break and was replaced by his assistant <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>.

Shankly continued to turn up at their <a href="Melwood">Melwood</a> training ground where the players still referred to him as 'boss'. Reluctantly, Paisley asked him to stay away from training, in order to assert his authority as manager. Liverpool were unbeaten in their first six <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Football%20League">1974–75 Football League</a> campaign matches. They recorded their record highest win, 11-0, versus <a href="Str%C3%B8msgodset%20IF">Strømsgodset</a> in the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1974–75 European Cup Winners' Cup</a> first round. Liverpool exited to Hungarians <a href="Ferencv%C3%A1rosi%20TC">Ferencváros</a> on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> in the second round. They exited in the fourth round in the FA Cup and Football League Cup. They finished second in the league for a trophyless season. Paisley signed <a href="Phil%20Neal">Phil Neal</a>, <a href="Terry%20McDermott">Terry McDermott</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Case">Jimmy Case</a> who would all score in future UEFA finals.

Liverpool began the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League">1975–76 Football League</a> campaign losing 2–0 to <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers (QPR)</a>. Liverpool's form picked up in the second half of the season. Only one point dropped in nine late season games left them a point behind QPR going into their final match. QPR had already finished their games. Wolverhampton Wanderers were a goal up at half-time but Liverpool won 3–1 to win the League title. Liverpool exited early in the FA Cup and League Cup. In the <a href="1976%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">1976 UEFA Cup Final</a>, <a href="Club%20Brugge%20KV">Club Brugge</a> scored two early goals at Anfield before Ray Kennedy, Case and a Keegan penalty fought back for a 3-2 first leg lead. Keegan's equaliser in Belgium was enough for a 4-3 aggregate win and a second Liverpool winning of that trophy.

Before the start of <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League">1976–77</a> season, Keegan said, "There's a tremendous ambition among all the lads to win the European Cup. We've won everything else in the last five years and there's a feeling that the European Cup is going to be next." Liverpool started by losing only two of their first 16 games in the League to go top by September. Despite a Christmas period blip including a 5–1 loss to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, Liverpool won their tenth League title. The <a href="1977%20European%20Cup%20Final">1977 European Cup Final</a> was Liverpool's first. McDermott, Smith and Neal goals gave a 3-1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach. They lost the <a href="1977%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1977 FA Cup Final</a> 2-1 to Manchester United to miss out on a trophy <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a>.

On 10 August 1977 <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> signed from <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> for a new club record £440,000 fee to replace Keegan's £500,000 departure to <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburg</a>. <a href="Alan%20Hansen">Alan Hansen</a> signed from <a href="Partick%20Thistle">Partick Thistle</a> two months before Dalglish and <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a> followed in January from <a href="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>. Dalglish scored 20 goals in 42 <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Football%20League">1977–78 Football League</a> games and scored from a Souness pass in Liverpool's <a href="1978%20European%20Cup%20Final">1978 European Cup Final</a> 1–0 win over Club Brugge. They were the first British team to retain the European Cup. They finished seven points behind <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in the League who also beat them 1-0 in the <a href="1978%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1978 Football League Cup Final</a> <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a>. The first game was 0-0. Liverpool declined to take part in the <a href="1977%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1977 Intercontinental Cup</a>.

Nottingham Forest beat Liverpool 2–0 on aggregate in the <a href="1978-79%20European%20Cup">1978-79 European Cup</a> first round. Liverpool exited 1–0 to <a href="Sheffield%20United">Sheffield United</a> in the <a href="1978-79%20Football%20League%20Cup">1978-79 Football League Cup</a> second round. They won their first six league games and were unbeaten before a match 12, 1–0 derby loss to Everton. Good form continued through the <a href="1978-79%20Football%20League">1978-79 Football League</a> campaign winning eight points above Nottingham Forest. Their 68 league points surpassed the previous record, 67 by Leeds United in 1968–69. Only 16 goals conceded was another record. Liverpool declined to take part in the 1978 Intercontinental Cup.

Despite early defeats to <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> and Nottingham Forest, Liverpool topped the <a href="1979-80%20Football%20League">1979-80 Football League</a> by January staying top for the rest of the season. A 4–1 win over Aston Villa in the penultimate game of the season retained the League title. They were unbeaten at Anfield all season where they conceded only eight goals. Liverpool exited in the first round of the European Cup to Soviet team <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Tbilisi">Dinamo Tbilisi</a>. They exited in the semi finals of the FA Cup and League Cup to Arsenal and Forest respectively. Liverpool were the first British club with a shirt sponsor, <a href="Hitachi">Hitachi</a>. Chairman John Smith said, "The days are gone when a club like ours can control its destiny on the money coming through the turnstiles." In April 1980 Liverpool signed 18 year old Welsh striker <a href="Ian%20Rush">Ian Rush</a>, the club's future record goalscorer.

In the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Football%20League">1980–81 Football League</a> eight losses (the same as champions, <a href="Aston%20Villa">Aston Villa</a>), and 17 draws meant finishing fifth, their worst finish for 16 years. Their <a href="1981%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1981 Football League Cup Final</a> replay, 2-1 come back win over <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> was their first lifting of that trophy. <a href="Alan%20Kennedy">Alan Kennedy</a> put Liverpool ahead in extra-time in the 1-1 first game draw.

<a href="Bruce%20Grobbelaar">Bruce Grobbelaar</a> became first team goalkeeper after Clemence's 1981 summer transfer to Tottenham Hotspur. In the <a href="1981-82%20Football%20League">1981-82 Football League</a> campaign, Liverpool were twelfth after a Boxing Day 3-1 home defeat to Manchester City with only 6 wins from 17 games. Paisley responded by taking the club captaincy from Thompson and giving it to Souness. 11 successive wins towards the end of the season won the League four points above <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. Liverpool lost 2-0 at Second Division Chelsea in the <a href="1981-82%20FA%20Cup">1981-82 FA Cup</a> fifth round. <a href="Ronnie%20Whelan">Ronnie Whelan</a> equalised <a href="Steve%20Archibald">Steve Archibald</a>'s Tottenham goal with three minutes left in the <a href="1982%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1982 Football League Cup Final</a>. Liverpool retained the trophy 3-1 after extra-time with Whelan's second goal and one by Ian Rush. The <a href="1981%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1981 Intercontinental Cup</a> was Liverpool's first in that tournament. <a href="Flamengo">Flamengo</a> won 3-0 at the <a href="National%20Stadium%20%28Tokyo%29">National Stadium in Tokyo</a>.

Liverpool retained the League title in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League">1982–83</a>, 11 points above Watford. Liverpool exited the FA Cup and European Cup in the fifth round and quarter-final respectively. A <a href="1983%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1983 Football League Cup Final</a>, 2–1 win over Manchester United meant Liverpool won that trophy for a third straight year. Alan Kennedy's late equaliser of <a href="Norman%20Whiteside">Norman Whiteside</a>'s goal took the final to extra-time. Whelan scored the winner. Pre-season, Paisley announced it would be his last before retiring from management aged 64. Paisley won six League titles, three European Cups and three League Cups during his managerial reign, the most successful in Liverpool's history. His assistant, <a href="Joe%20Fagan">Joe Fagan</a>, took over.

Fagan's era began with a unique treble. Liverpool topped the <a href="1982-83%20Football%20League">1982-83 Football League</a> in November and stayed there to win three points above Southampton. This equalled the record three consecutive League titles held by Huddersfield Town and Arsenal. Ian Rush top scored with 32 league goals and 13 in other competitions. The <a href="1984%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1984 Football League Cup Final</a> win was their fourth in a row.

Liverpool lost the <a href="1984%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1984 Intercontinental Cup</a> to Argentine side <a href="CA%20Independiente">CA Independiente</a> 1–0 in Tokyo.

In 1984-85 Liverpool failed to win a trophy for the first time in nine years. In October in the <a href="1984-85%20Football%20League">1984-85 Football League</a> Liverpool were in the relegation places. Form improved to finish second 13 points behind Everton. They exited in the third round of the <a href="1984-85%20Football%20League%20Cup">1984-85 Football League Cup</a>. Semi final loss to Manchester United prevented an all Merseyside <a href="1985%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1985 FA Cup Final</a> with Everton.

The <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Final</a> was Liverpool's fifth such final. Before the match at the <a href="King%20Baudouin%20Stadium">Heysel Stadium</a> began, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating opposing fans. As <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> fans fled to safety, the accumulation of people against a perimeter wall caused it to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. The wall collapse was followed by Juventus fans rioting at the stadium's other end. The match was delayed two hours before starting with fear abandonment would cause further violence. <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a>'s penalty won the final 1–0 for the Italians.

In the tragedy's aftermath, blame for the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a> was laid on the Liverpool fans. <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> official Günter Schneider stated, "Only the English fans were responsible. Of that, there is no doubt." <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> withdrew English clubs from European competition. Two days later UEFA banned English clubs for "an indeterminate period of time". Liverpool were banned for three further years beyond the English club ban ending. Fagan had decided to retire before the match. With his 64th birthday approaching he felt not the ideal choice for the required team rebuilding. Dalglish took over, the club's first <a href="Player-coach">player-manager</a>.

Fakih Usman

<a href="Kyai">Kyai</a> <a href="Hajji">Hajji</a> Fakih Usman (also Faqih Usman; ; 2 March 1904 – 3 October 1968) was an Indonesian Islamic leader and politician with the <a href="Masyumi%20Party">Masyumi Party</a>. He twice served as the Minister of Religious Affairs: under the <a href="Halim%20Cabinet">Halim Cabinet</a> in the State of the Republic of Indonesia in 1950, and in the national government during the <a href="Wilopo%20Cabinet">Wilopo Cabinet</a> from 1952 to 1953. In his early years Fakih was criticised by conservative Muslims for his involvement with the modernist Islamic organisation <a href="Muhammadiyah">Muhammadiyah</a>, though that group remembers him warmly.

Born to a merchant and his wife in Gresik, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, Fakih studied with his father and at a series of "<a href="pesantren">pesantren</a>" (Islamic boarding schools) until the 1920s. In 1925 he became involved with the Muhammadiyah, rising quickly through the leadership until he became the head of the <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a> branch in 1938. He was also active in local politics. When a group of Islamic organisations formed the Indonesian Islamic Assembly in 1937, Fakih became treasurer. He continued to be involved in politics and Islamic groups during the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupation</a> and ensuing <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">national revolution</a>. While serving as minister of religious affairs, he oversaw educational and institutional reform, growing in prominence within the Muhammadiyah. He served as deputy chairman of the organisation under several different leaders before being chosen as its chairman in late 1968, several days before his death.

Fakih was born in <a href="Gresik">Gresik</a>, <a href="East%20Java">East Java</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, on 2 March 1904. His father, Usman Iskandar, was a wood merchant, and his mother, a housewife, was the daughter of an "<a href="ulama">ulama</a>" (scholar of Islam). The couple, who were of modest means, had four other children, and the family's lack of a <a href="priyayi">noble background</a> meant the children were ineligible to receive an education at Dutch-run schools. Instead, Fakih studied Islam from a young age, receiving much of his instruction from his father. At the age of ten he began studying at a "<a href="pesantren">pesantren</a>" (Islamic boarding school) in Gresik, finishing four years later. In 1919 he continued his studies at several "pesantren" outside the city, including ones in rural Gresik and in nearby Bungah.

Fakih's father helped him become a trader, although Fakih continued to study independently. When the modernist Islamic organisation <a href="Muhammadiyah">Muhammadiyah</a> opened a branch in Gresik in 1922, Fakih was one of the first to join. Extremely active in the group, he became the Gresik branch's leader within three years, and under his leadership the group was formally recognised by the central Muhammadiyah administration. Through his work with the Muhammadiyah in Gresik, Fakih became better known. He later transferred to the branch in Surabaya, a much larger city where, in 1929, he was chosen to sit on the city council. He also remained active in commerce, running a construction material trade and shipbuilding shop. During this period he served on the local chamber of commerce.

From 1932 to 1936 Fakih was a member of the Muhammadiyah's regional council, serving concurrently as the editor of the organisation's official magazine "Bintang Islam" and on the Legal Affairs Committee. As he became more active, Fakih began commuting regularly from Surabaya to Gresik, handling Muhammadiyah business in Surabaya and the wood company in Gresik; this commute was done in Fakih's personal car, a rare luxury at the time. Studying Dutch in his spare time, Fakih continued to improve his knowledge of Islam by studying the thoughts of <a href="Muhammad%20Abduh">Muhammad Abduh</a>. However, conservative Muslims disapproved of Fakih's work with Muhammadiyah, giving him the nickname ("Dutchman with the black arse"), and often throwing stones at his home.

On 21 September 1937, Muhammadiyah, the conservative <a href="Nahdatul%20Ulama">Nahdatul Ulama</a> (NU), the merchants' cooperative <a href="Sarekat%20Islam">Sarekat Islam</a>, and several other Islamic groups – which for the past decade had been feuding – united to form an umbrella group: the Indonesian Islamic Assembly (, or MIAI), based in Surabaya. Fakih served as treasurer. In 1938 he was made the head of the Surabaya branch of the Muhammadiyah, replacing <a href="Mas%20Mansoer">Mas Mansoer</a>. Two years later he began working full-time with the MIAI, having been selected as the head of its secretariat in mid-September 1940. To take this position, he resigned as head of the Surabaya branch of Muhammadiyah and as a city council member.

On 9 March 1942 Governor-General <a href="Tjarda%20van%20Starkenborgh%20Stachouwer">Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer</a> and head of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20East%20Indies%20Army">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a> General <a href="Hein%20ter%20Poorten">Hein ter Poorten</a> capitulated to the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>, which had <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">invaded the Indies</a> the month before. As a result, the Indies fell under Japanese control. The Japanese banned all forms of organisations, and the MIAI was disbanded in May. It was reformed on 5 September 1942 following a meeting of 30 ulamas in the Des Indes Hotel in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, and was recognised by the occupation government as the sole Islamic organisation in the country. At the end of 1943, the organisation was renamed the <a href="Masyumi%20Party">Council of Indonesian Muslim Associations</a> (, or Masyumi). Fakih was made a member of the Japanese-sponsored advisory board, or Syu Sangi In, for Surabaya. He held this position until the end of the occupation, concurrently serving on the Masyumi board.

After the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> and the <a href="proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20independence">proclamation of Indonesian independence</a> in August 1945, the Japanese began withdrawing from the nascent republic. The Indonesian republican government, based in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> and including <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a> as president and <a href="Mohammad%20Hatta">Mohammad Hatta</a> as vice president, began to take over infrastructure from the departing Japanese. By September 1945, however, allied British and Dutch forces had begun to enter the archipelago, hoping to reestablish the <a href="status%20quo">status quo ante</a>. The British initially focused on Java and Sumatra and attempted to avoid armed confrontations with the Republican forces; the Dutch, meanwhile, spent the first months after the Japanese surrender reclaiming the eastern islands with help from Australia.

Fakih, who had begun making contacts within the republican government, participated in the Indonesian Islamic Conference () in Yogyakarta from 7 to 8 November 1945. As a result of these talks, Masyumi was made into a political party representing Islamic interests. Although Fakih returned to Gresik after the conference, he and his family soon evacuated to <a href="Malang">Malang</a> due to the outbreak of a <a href="Battle%20of%20Surabaya">battle at Surabaya</a> between Republican soldiers and British forces tasked with repatriating Dutch prisoners of war.

In Malang, Fakih worked with <a href="Masjkur">Masjkur</a> and <a href="Zainul%20Arifin">Zainul Arifin</a> to start an armed resistance to fight in the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">revolution</a> against the returning Europeans. He served as deputy chief in command of this resistance, which consisted of the Japanese-trained Islamic units Sabilillah and Hizbullah. After the Dutch launched <a href="Operation%20Kraai">Operation Kraai</a> in December 1948, Fakih and his family escaped to <a href="Surakarta">Surakarta</a>, where he again became active in Muhammadiyah. Fakih, serving as deputy chair under Bagus Hadikusumo, frequently commuted between Surakarta and the organisation's head office in <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>.

In late 1949 the Indonesian and Dutch governments held a <a href="Dutch%E2%80%93Indonesian%20Round%20Table%20Conference">conference</a> lasting several months, which resulted in Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty on 27 December 1949. This led to the formation of the <a href="United%20States%20of%20Indonesia">United States of Indonesia</a> (, or RIS), which consisted of sixteen member states. On 21 January 1950 Fakih replaced Masjkur as the Minister of Religious Affairs in the <a href="Halim%20Cabinet">Halim Cabinet</a>, representing the Republic of Indonesia; at this point the republic consisted of Yogyakarta, <a href="Banten">Banten</a>, and much of <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>. Working with the RIS Minister of Religious Affairs <a href="Wahid%20Hasyim">Wahid Hasyim</a>, Fakih began instituting a standardised religious curriculum in the public schools and modernising education at religious schools. The two also worked to unite the ministries. On 17 August 1950 the RIS and its member states became a unified republic. Hasyim was kept on as minister of religious affairs, with Fakih appointed director of religious education.

Meanwhile, the different factions in Masyumi were in conflict over the path the party was taking; the NU members thought Masyumi was becoming too political, abandoning its Islamic roots. When the <a href="Natsir%20Cabinet">Natsir Cabinet</a> began to collapse, the Masyumi put forth Fakih as a potential Minister for Religious Affairs. This act was controversial because four of the five allocated slots for the party were already filled by non-NU members, and ultimately the NU pulled out of Masyumi, effective 5 April 1952. Fakih had been chosen with a majority of five votes, while the next leading candidate, Usman Raliby, received four.

Fakih was made the Minister of Religious Affairs in the <a href="Wilopo%20Cabinet">Wilopo Cabinet</a> and sworn in on 3 April 1952, which led to him and his family moving to the capital at Jakarta. He began to work on reforming the ministry, including formalising its mission statement: to provide religious teachers, promote interfaith relations, and to establish the dates of religious holidays. He worked on internal structure, including formalising the ministry's leadership hierarchy and the opening of the provincial and regional branches. The ministry also continued its promotion of religious education and was tasked with handling the numerous Indonesian pilgrims who went on the <a href="hajj">hajj</a>. The Wilopo Cabinet collapsed on 30 July 1953, following an immigration and land dispute in <a href="Medan">Medan</a>. Fakih was replaced by Masjkur.

Fakih continued to work with the ministry and the Muhammadiyah, serving as the organisation's First Deputy Chair under Ahmad Rasyid Sutan Mansur. In 1956 he was one of three Muhammadiyah members who presented their concept of a truly Islamic society, one which emphasised social education. During this time he was more active with Masyumi, and after the <a href="Indonesian%20Constituent%20Assembly%20election%2C%201955">1955 Constituent Assembly election</a>, Fakih was made a member of the <a href="Constitutional%20Assembly%20of%20Indonesia">Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia</a>. This assembly, meant to reach an agreement for a new national constitution, failed to gain a consensus, and was disbanded by president Sukarno with his <a href="President%20Sukarno%27s%201959%20Decree">decree of 5 July 1959</a>. That year Fakih collaborated with <a href="Hamka">Hamka</a>, Joesoef Poear Abdullah, and Ahmad Joesoef to launch the magazine "Pandji Masjarakat". Sukarno later disbanded Masyumi on 17 August 1960 after leading Masyumi members, such as <a href="Mohammad%20Natsir">Mohammad Natsir</a> and <a href="Sjafruddin%20Prawiranegara">Sjafruddin Prawiranegara</a>, were involved with the <a href="Revolutionary%20Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Indonesia">Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia</a>; Fakih had been involved in the negotiations with the Revolutionary Government, working with <a href="Mohammad%20Roem">Mohammad Roem</a>.

The disbanding of Masyumi left Fakih with more time to focus on the Muhammadiyah, serving as the Second Deputy Chair under Junus Anis. During a leadership course run by the organisation during <a href="Ramadhan">Ramadhan</a> of 1380 <a href="Hijri%20year">AH</a> (February/March 1961), Fakih began promoting an institutional identity through his lecture "Apakah Muhammadiyah Itu" ("What is Muhammadiyah?"). This outlined the organisation as one based in <a href="dawah">dawah</a>, focusing on real-world issues, and willing to work with the government to ensure a prosperous future for Muslims. These concepts were later formulated through 1962 and established as an institutional identity, one which called for Muhammadiyah to work towards creating a truly Islamic society while opposing <a href="leftism">leftist politics</a>. This, in turn, was followed by refactoring within the organisation to better adapt the new identity.

From 1962 until 1965 Fakih served as the First Deputy Chair of Muhammadiyah under Ahmad Badawi, providing guidance for young religious leaders. During <a href="Indonesian%20killings%20of%201965%E2%80%931966">the killings</a> and power shift which followed the <a href="30%20September%20Movement">30 September Movement</a> coup attempt, Fakih and several Muhammadiyah members sent a letter requesting that Masyumi be allowed to reform; this permission was not granted. For Badawi's second term, Fakih served as an advisor to the chairman, often taking management responsibilities. He was selected as the organisation's chairman at the 37th Muhammadiyah Congress in 1968.

On being chosen as chairman, Fakih began work to ensure there would be a successor, as his health was failing. On 2 October, at a joint meeting of the board at his home, he outlined his plans for his three-year period of leadership; Fakih also appointed Rasjidi and <a href="Abdul%20Rozak%20Fachruddin">Abdul Rozak Fachruddin</a> as temporary leaders while he went abroad for medical treatment. Fakih died on 3 October 1968, only a few days after being selected, and was replaced by Fachruddin on the day of his death; Fachruddin served as chairman for 24 years.

The street where Fakih lived as a child is now known as Fakih Usman Street. Within Muhammadiyah Fakih continues to be well respected. He is credited with the formulation of the "Muhammadiyah Personality" (), Muhammadiyah's institutional identity. Out of respect towards Fakih, the Muhammadiyah continues to record his period as chairman as lasting the full three-year term. Didin Syafruddin, a faculty member at the <a href="Jakarta%20Islamic%20State%20University">Jakarta Islamic State University</a>, writes that Fakih was highly dedicated to education, noting that five of Fakih's seven children eventually became <a href="Doctor%20%28title%29">doctors</a>; Syafruddin also writes that, owing to a lack of human resources, Fakih was limited in his reforms while Minister of Religious Affairs. Former Muhammadiyah chairman <a href="Ahmad%20Syafi%27i%20Maarif">Ahmad Syafi'i Maarif</a> described Fakih as the "tranquil, cleansing water" who served as a calming influence for Muhammadiyah when the organisation was in turmoil.

McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in Australian service

The <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) operated 24 <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II</a> <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a> aircraft in the <a href="Close%20air%20support">ground attack</a> role between 1970 and 1973. The Phantoms were leased from the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) as an interim measure owing to delays in the delivery of the RAAF's 24 <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> bombers. The F-4Es were considered successful in this role, but the government did not agree to a proposal from the RAAF to retain the aircraft after the F-111s entered service in 1973.

The F-4C variant of the Phantom II was among the aircraft evaluated by the RAAF in 1963 as part of the project to replace its <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> bombers. The F-111 was selected, but when that project was delayed in the late 1960s due to long-running technical faults with the aircraft, the RAAF determined that the F-4E Phantom II would be the best alternative. As a result of continued problems with the F-111s, the Australian and United States Governments negotiated an agreement in 1970 whereby the RAAF leased 24 F-4Es and their support equipment from the USAF.

The RAAF's F-4Es entered service in September 1970, and proved to be highly effective. Used in the air-to-ground role, they prepared aircrew to operate the sophisticated F-111s, and the intensive training program undertaken using the aircraft improved the RAAF's professional standards. One of the Phantoms was destroyed in a flying accident in June 1971, and another was repaired by the RAAF after it sustained heavy damage during a crash landing. The 23 surviving aircraft were returned to the USAF in two batches during October 1972 and June 1973.

The <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">McDonnell Douglas F-4C Phantom II</a> was one of the aircraft types evaluated by the RAAF as a potential replacement for its aging <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> bombers in the early 1960s. In mid-1963 a team of senior RAAF officers headed by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Valston Hancock</a>, travelled to the United States to evaluate the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111%20Aardvark">General Dynamics F-111</a> (then known as the "TFX"), <a href="North%20American%20A-5%20Vigilante">North American A-5 Vigilante</a> and F-4C Phantom II <a href="Bomber">strike aircraft</a>. While in the United States, the team also inspected the <a href="Boeing%20KC-135%20Stratotanker">Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker</a>, which was considered necessary to support these aircraft. In addition, the RAAF officers travelled to the United Kingdom and France to evaluate the <a href="BAC%20TSR-2">BAC TSR-2</a> and <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20IV">Dassault Mirage IV</a>, respectively. In its final report, the team rejected the F-4C on the grounds that the aircraft lacked the range, performance at low altitude and reconnaissance capability that the RAAF required. The F-111 was considered to be the most suitable aircraft of those considered, but the team proposed that the RAAF acquire 36 Vigilantes as they also met the force's requirements and could be delivered within a shorter time frame. The <a href="Australian%20Government">Australian Government</a> rejected this advice, and decided to purchase 24 F-111s. At the time the order was placed in late 1963 these aircraft were scheduled to be delivered in 1967; the delivery date was pushed back to 1968 after Australia decided to order the unique <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">F-111C</a> variant. In late 1963 the United States Government offered to lend Australia 24 <a href="Boeing%20B-47%20Stratojet">Boeing B-47 Stratojet</a> bombers until the F-111s were delivered. The <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> opposed acquiring these aircraft on the grounds that they were obsolete and would be expensive to operate. Instead, it recommended to <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Australia">Cabinet</a> that a package of F-4C strike aircraft, the RF-4C reconnaissance variant of this design, and KC-135 tankers be leased from the United States if an interim force was considered necessary. Cabinet considered the two options during 1964, and rejected both of them. Between 1965 and 1970 six Australian pilots serving on exchange postings to the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) flew Phantoms in combat during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.
The F-111 program experienced significant problems during the late 1960s. As a result of delays to the development of the RF-111 reconnaissance variant of the F-111, of which Australia had ordered four, the RAAF considered purchasing eight RF-4C or RF-4E reconnaissance aircraft and two tankers in early 1968. The Air Force and government eventually concluded that it was too early to make a decision on this matter, and no action was taken. The RAAF accepted all 24 F-111Cs at a ceremony held at <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>, on 4 September 1968. At this time the F-111 program was in crisis owing to technical problems with the design of the aircraft's wing assembly, and all F-111s were grounded after an American F-111 crashed on 23 September. Subsequent testing revealed further problems with F-111 components not meeting their intended lifespan, and the Australian aircraft were placed in storage at Fort Worth until these flaws could be rectified. The RAAF subsequently evaluated the F-4E Phantom II, <a href="Blackburn%20Buccaneer">Blackburn Buccaneer</a>, <a href="LTV%20A-7%20Corsair%20II">LTV A-7 Corsair II</a> and <a href="Grumman%20A-6%20Intruder">Grumman A-6 Intruder</a> as possible replacements for the F-111. Only the F-4E was considered to come close to meeting the RAAF's requirements, though its relatively short range and lack of <a href="terrain-following%20radar">terrain-following radar</a> and <a href="electronic%20countermeasure">electronic countermeasure</a>s were considered problematic.

By 1970 the F-111Cs were still not airworthy, and the Australian Government was under pressure to cancel the order or acquire an interim design. In April of that year Minister for Defence <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> signed an agreement with his American counterpart, <a href="Melvin%20R.%20Laird">Melvin R. Laird</a>, which specified the conditions under which the Australian Government would accept the F-111s. As part of the negotiations leading to this agreement, Laird offered to lease Australia 24 F-4E Phantoms at a reduced price. The Cabinet agreed to Fraser's recommendation that this offer be taken up, a move supported by the Air Board. The RAAF remained committed to the F-111C, however, and the Air Board issued a statement during May arguing that these aircraft would "meet the RAAF operational requirement more effectively than the F-4E by a decisive margin".

An RAAF team headed by the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Charles%20Read%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Read</a>, was sent to the United States in May 1970 to negotiate the lease arrangements. After considering the proposed deal, Read recommended that it go ahead; according to RAAF historian Alan Stephens this decision "delighted RAAF senior officers and aircrews". The Cabinet subsequently approved the lease of 24 Phantoms for two years at a total cost of $US 41.554 million (including training, spare parts and technical advice) and the formal agreement to do so was signed on 29 June 1970. The USAF designated this project "Peace Reef". The terms of the lease agreement allowed the Australian Government to purchase the Phantoms outright if the F-111C program was cancelled, but also allowed the USAF to demand the immediate return of the aircraft and their support equipment in the event of a national emergency. Laird provided Fraser with a written commitment that this option would not be exercised, and it was never publicised. Laird also promised that USAF tankers would be made available to support the Australian Phantoms during crises, subject to American national requirements and the terms of relevant agreements between the two countries.

The RAAF's Phantoms were delivered soon after the lease agreement was completed. Australian pilots and navigators from the two units that were to operate the aircraft, <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1</a> and <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 Squadrons</a>, began to arrive in the United States for conversion training in July 1970. Most of this training was provided by the 4530th Tactical Training Squadron, <a href="1st%20Tactical%20Fighter%20Wing">1st Tactical Fighter Wing</a>, at <a href="MacDill%20Air%20Force%20Base">MacDill Air Force Base</a> in Florida, and involved 32 hours of flying. USAF personnel were also posted to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a> in Queensland, where the F-4Es were to be based, to train Australian ground crew. The Australian Phantoms were diverted from USAF orders and were brand new. The RAAF accepted all 24 aircraft in September 1970, and they were subsequently ferried to Amberley in four groups of six aircraft; the first three groups arrived on 14, 19 and 26 September, and the final group arrived on 3 October. The Phantom was allocated the RAAF serial number prefix "A69", but this was never applied to the aircraft, and they retained their USAF serials.
The Phantom represented a significant improvement to the RAAF's ground attack capabilities. The F-4Es were more technologically advanced than the Canberra, as they could fly at supersonic speeds, were equipped with air-to-air radar and missiles, and had an <a href="inertial%20navigation%20system">inertial navigation system</a>, ground-attack computer and a cannon. The Phantoms were capable of operating in several roles; the RAAF primarily used them as strike aircraft. This role was selected to prepare aircrew to operate F-111s, and most training exercises were focused on tasks that the F-111s would also be able to perform.

Aircrew training using the F-4Es began three days after the aircraft first arrived at Amberley. The aircraft were initially operated as a pool controlled by <a href="No.%2082%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 82 Wing</a> (the parent headquarters for No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons) and were allocated between the two squadrons only after all the Phantoms, aircrew and ground crew had arrived in Australia. The training program gradually increased in complexity, with night flying beginning in October, practice-bombing <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s commencing in late November and air-to-air sorties being flown from January 1971. Ground attack missions were practiced from February 1971, and in June that year the Phantoms began dropping live bombs during exercises. The introduction of several of the aircraft into service was delayed by an initial shortage of spare parts, but all were operational by the end of 1970.

During their service with the RAAF, the Phantoms were operated alongside the RAAF's <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Dassault Mirage III</a> fighters and the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy's</a> <a href="Douglas%20A-4%20Skyhawk">Douglas A-4 Skyhawk</a> ground attack aircraft. In addition to routine training flights, the Phantoms participated in major air defence exercises and also flew practice sorties against warships. The F-4Es also took part in airshows, including four that formed part of the flying displays conducted in different parts of Australia to mark the RAAF's 50th anniversary during March and April 1971.

Maintenance of the Phantoms was undertaken by <a href="No.%20482%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 482 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%203%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 3 Aircraft Depot</a>, both of which were located at Amberley. In addition to routine servicing, these units modified the Phantoms' <a href="AN/APQ-120">AN/APQ-120</a> radars during early 1971. In response to problems detected during maintenance, RAAF technical personnel checked all the aircraft for defects to their emergency <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flap</a> system in September 1971 and used X-ray testing to detect any cracks in their <a href="stabilator">stabilator</a>s during early 1972.

The RAAF's Phantoms suffered several accidents. The first occurred on 19 October 1970 when the systems needed to power the <a href="Anti-lock%20braking%20system">brake skid</a> and nosewheel steering on board Phantom A69-7234 failed during flight. It was decided to use Amberley's <a href="Arresting%20gear">arresting equipment</a> to slow the aircraft as it landed, but this system failed after A69-7234's tail hook engaged the wires, causing the Phantom to slide off the runway. The pilot only suffered minor injuries and the navigator was unhurt, but A69-7234 was badly damaged. The aircraft was subsequently rebuilt by No. 3 Aircraft Depot and returned to service on 30 September 1971; at the time this was the most complex Phantom repair task to have been undertaken by military personnel in any of the countries operating the aircraft. The next serious accident occurred on the night of 16 June 1971 when A69-7203 crashed into the sea during an exercise near <a href="Evans%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Evans Head, New South Wales</a>, resulting in the death of the aircraft's pilot and navigator. The cost of this aircraft was written off against that of an Australian <a href="Lockheed%20P-3%20Orion">Lockheed P-3B Orion</a> that had crashed in the United States during 1968 before being delivered to the RAAF. Other accidents involving the Phantom included A67-7220 being over-stressed in flight during February 1971 (which led to its engines being sent back to the United States for repairs) and A69-7206's nosewheel collapsing during takeoff in January 1972.

The RAAF was highly satisfied with the performance of the F-4Es, and they played an important role in preparing No. 82 Wing to operate the F-111. Many personnel in the Air Force believed that it would have been very difficult for the wing to have transitioned directly from the Canberra to the much more complicated F-111. In particular, the Phantoms gave RAAF personnel experience operating aircraft fitted with sophisticated avionics and capable of using a wide range of weapons, and the intensive training program undertaken by No. 82 Wing during this period significantly improved its professionalism. In his book "Going Solo: The Royal Australian Air Force 1946–1971", Alan Stephens also argued that the speed with which the Air Force's aircrew and technical personnel adapted to operating Phantoms "illustrated the RAAF's exceptional technical competence".

Repairs to the RAAF's F-111Cs were undertaken from late 1971, and all 24 were accepted on 15 March 1973. The RAAF considered retaining the Phantoms after the F-111s entered service, and the US Government offered to sell the 23 remaining aircraft to Australia for $54 million. Studies found that the upfront cost of keeping the F-4Es would be $77 million, and that one of the Mirage III squadrons would need to be disbanded to man the Phantom-equipped units. Nevertheless, the Air Board recommended that the aircraft be retained, but a proposal to do so was rejected by the Cabinet in 1972 on advice from the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Treasury%20%28Australia%29">Treasury</a>. If the Phantoms had remained in service they would have been used to provide <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> for the Army.

The Phantoms began to be returned to the USAF in 1972. No. 6 Squadron ceased operating the aircraft on 4 October 1972. Six F-4Es departed for the United States on 25 October that year, followed by a further five in early November. The first six F-111s arrived at Amberley on 1 June 1973, and six Phantoms left for the United States five days later. The final RAAF Phantom flight was made on 20 June, and four of the aircraft departed the next day. The last two Phantoms left Amberley on 21 June. All but two of the former RAAF Phantoms were subsequently converted to specialist <a href="Wild%20Weasel">Wild Weasel</a> aircraft.

A former USAF F-4E is on display at the <a href="RAAF%20Museum">RAAF Museum</a> in Melbourne. This aircraft, which did not serve with the RAAF, was presented to the RAAF by the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">National Museum of the United States Air Force</a> in 1990, and is painted as one of the Phantoms operated by No. 82 Wing.

RKO Pictures

RKO Pictures was an American film production and distribution company. In its original incarnation, as RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. (a subsidiary of Radio-Keith-Orpheum, aka: RKO) it was one of the <a href="studio%20system">Big Five</a> <a href="major%20film%20studio">studios</a> of <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>'s <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Portrait%20of%20Classical%20Hollywood%20Cinema%20%281917%E2%80%931960%29">Golden Age</a>. The business was formed after the <a href="Keith-Albee-Orpheum">Keith-Albee-Orpheum</a> (KAO) theater chain and <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Kennedy">Joseph P. Kennedy's</a> <a href="Film%20Booking%20Offices%20of%20America">Film Booking Offices of America</a> (FBO) studio were brought together under the control of the <a href="Radio%20Corporation%20of%20America">Radio Corporation of America</a> (RCA) in October 1928. RCA chief <a href="David%20Sarnoff">David Sarnoff</a> engineered the merger to create a market for the company's <a href="sound-on-film">sound-on-film</a> technology, <a href="RCA%20Photophone">RCA Photophone</a>. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor <a href="Floyd%20Odlum">Floyd Odlum</a>.

RKO has long been renowned for its cycle of musicals starring <a href="Fred%20Astaire">Fred Astaire</a> and <a href="Ginger%20Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a> in the mid- to late 1930s. Actors <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> and, later, <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a> had their first major successes at the studio. <a href="Cary%20Grant">Cary Grant</a> was a mainstay for years. The work of producer <a href="Val%20Lewton">Val Lewton</a>'s low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced two of the most famous films in motion picture history: "<a href="King%20Kong%20%281933%20film%29">King Kong</a>" and "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>". RKO was also responsible for notable co-productions such as "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Wonderful%20Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a>" and "<a href="Notorious%20%281946%20film%29">Notorious</a>", and it also distributed many celebrated films by animation producer <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> (from 1937 to the mid-50s) and leading independent producer <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Productions">Samuel Goldwyn</a>.

Maverick industrialist <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> took over RKO in 1948. After years of disarray and decline under his control, the studio was acquired by the <a href="General%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">General Tire and Rubber Company</a> in 1955. The original RKO Pictures ceased production in 1957 and was effectively dissolved two years later. In 1981, broadcaster <a href="RKO%20General">RKO General</a>, the corporate heir, revived it as a production subsidiary, RKO Pictures Inc. In 1989, this business with its few remaining assets, the <a href="trademarks">trademarks</a> and <a href="remake">remake</a> rights to many classic RKO films, was sold to new owners, who now operate the small independent company RKO Pictures LLC.

In October 1927, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> released "<a href="The%20Jazz%20Singer">The Jazz Singer</a>", the first feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> to convert from silent to <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a> production en masse. The <a href="Radio%20Corporation%20of%20America">Radio Corporation of America</a> (RCA) controlled an advanced optical <a href="sound-on-film">sound-on-film</a> system, <a href="RCA%20Photophone">Photophone</a>, recently developed by <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a>, RCA's parent company. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">Fox</a>, Hollywood's other vanguard sound studio, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20%281885-2005%29">AT&T</a>'s <a href="Western%20Electric">Western Electric</a> division. The industry's two largest companies, <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount</a> and <a href="Loews%20Cineplex%20Entertainment">Loew's</a>/<a href="MGM">MGM</a>, with two other <a href="major%20film%20studio">major studios</a>, <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal</a> and <a href="First%20National%20Pictures">First National</a>, were poised to contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well.
Seeking a customer for Photophone, in late 1927 <a href="David%20Sarnoff">David Sarnoff</a>, then general manager of RCA, approached <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Kennedy">Joseph P. Kennedy</a> about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, <a href="Film%20Booking%20Offices%20of%20America">Film Booking Offices of America</a> (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of a plan for the company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large <a href="Keith-Albee-Orpheum">Keith-Albee-Orpheum</a> (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a>, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of <a href="Path%C3%A9%20Exchange">Pathé (U.S.)</a> and <a href="Cecil%20B.%20De%20Mille">Cecil B. De Mille</a> had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, <a href="Producers%20Distributing%20Corporation">Producers Distributing Corporation</a> (PDC). This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.

After an aborted attempt by Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had turned to him for help, First National, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company acquired Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced the creation of the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp. holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent (in the early 1930s, its share would rise as high as 60 percent). On January 25, 1929, the new company's production arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was unveiled as RKO Productions Inc. A week later, it filed for the trademark "Radio Pictures". Looking to get out of the film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him. On January 29, 1931, Pathé, with its contract players, well-regarded newsreel operation, and <a href="Culver%20Studios">Culver City studio and backlot</a>, was merged into RKO as Kennedy sold off the last of his stock in the company he had been instrumental in creating.

RKO began production at the small facility FBO shared with Pathé in New York City while the main FBO studio in Hollywood was technologically refitted. In charge of production was <a href="William%20LeBaron">William LeBaron</a>, who had held the same position at FBO. The new company's two initial releases were musicals: The melodramatic "<a href="Syncopation%20%281929%20film%29">Syncopation</a>", which actually completed shooting before FBO was reincorporated as RKO, premiered on March 29, 1929. The comedic "<a href="Street%20Girl">Street Girl</a>" debuted July 30. This was billed as RKO's first "official" production and its first to be shot in Hollywood. A few nonsinging pictures followed, but the studio's first major hit was again a musical. RKO spent heavily on the lavish "<a href="Rio%20Rita%20%281929%20film%29">Rio Rita</a>", including a number of <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> sequences. Opening in September to rave reviews, it was named one of the ten best pictures of the year by "Film Daily". Cinema historian Richard Barrios credits it with initiating the "first age of the filmed Broadway musical". By the end of the year, RKO was making use of an additional production facility—five hundred acres had been acquired near <a href="Encino%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Encino</a> in the <a href="San%20Fernando%20Valley">San Fernando Valley</a> as a <a href="movie%20ranch">movie ranch</a> for exteriors and large-scale standing sets.

RKO released a limited slate of twelve features in its first year; in 1930, that figure more than doubled to twenty-nine. Initially organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a transition into the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Encouraged by "Rio Rita"s success, RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating Technicolor sequences, among them "<a href="Dixiana%20%28film%29">Dixiana</a>" and "<a href="Hit%20the%20Deck%20%281930%20film%29">Hit the Deck</a>", both scripted and directed, like "Rio Rita", by <a href="Luther%20Reed">Luther Reed</a>. Following the example of the other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical <a href="revue">revue</a>, "Radio Revels". Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor. The project was abandoned, however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931. RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, "<a href="The%20Runaround">The Runaround</a>" and "<a href="Fanny%20Foley%20Herself">Fanny Foley Herself</a>" (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.

Even as the U.S. economy foundered, RKO had gone on a spending spree, buying up theater after theater to add to its exhibition chain. In October 1930, the company purchased a 50 percent stake in the New York <a href="Van%20Beuren%20Studios">Van Beuren</a> studio, which specialized in cartoons and live shorts. RKO's production schedule soon surpassed forty features a year, released under the names "Radio Pictures" and, for a short time after the 1931 merger, "RKO Pathé". "<a href="Cimarron%20%281931%20film%29">Cimarron</a>" (1931), produced by LeBaron himself, would become the only RKO production to win the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>; nonetheless, having cost a profligate $1.4 million to make, it was a money-loser on original domestic release. The most popular RKO star of this <a href="Pre-Code%20Hollywood">pre-Code</a> era was <a href="Irene%20Dunne">Irene Dunne</a>, who made her debut as the lead in the 1930 musical "<a href="Leathernecking">Leathernecking</a>" and was a headliner at the studio for the entire decade. Other major performers included <a href="Joel%20McCrea">Joel McCrea</a>, <a href="Ricardo%20Cortez">Ricardo Cortez</a>, <a href="Dolores%20del%20R%C3%ADo">Dolores del Río</a>, and <a href="Mary%20Astor">Mary Astor</a>. <a href="Richard%20Dix%20%28actor%29">Richard Dix</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Oscar-nominated</a> for his lead performance in "Cimarron", would serve as RKO's standby <a href="B-movie">B-movie</a> star until the early 1940s. The comedy team of <a href="Wheeler%20%26amp%3B%20Woolsey">Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey</a>, often wrangling over ingenue <a href="Dorothy%20Lee%20%28actress%29">Dorothy Lee</a>, was a bankable mainstay for years. <a href="Constance%20Bennett">Constance Bennett</a>, <a href="Ann%20Harding">Ann Harding</a>, and <a href="Helen%20Twelvetrees">Helen Twelvetrees</a> came over with Pathé. The Pathé acquisition, though a defensible investment in the long term for its physical facilities, was yet another major expense borne by the fledgling RKO, particularly as Pathé's stock price had been artificially inflated by some prepurchase finagling. After little more than a year of semiautonomous operation within RKO, Pathé was dissolved as a feature production unit.

Exceptions like "Cimarron" and "Rio Rita" aside, RKO's product was largely regarded as mediocre, so in October 1931 Sarnoff hired twenty-nine-year-old <a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> to replace LeBaron as production chief. In addition to implementing rigorous cost-control measures, Selznick championed the unit production system, which gave the <a href="Film%20producer">producers</a> of individual movies much greater independence than they had under the prevailing central producer system. "Under the factory system of production you rob the director of his individualism", said Selznick, "and this being a creative industry that is harmful to the quality of the product made." Instituting unit production, he predicted, would also result in cost savings of 30–40 percent. To make films under the new system, Selznick recruited prize behind-the-camera personnel, such as <a href="Film%20director">director</a> <a href="George%20Cukor">George Cukor</a> and producer/director <a href="Merian%20C.%20Cooper">Merian C. Cooper</a>, and gave producer <a href="Pandro%20S.%20Berman">Pandro S. Berman</a>, aged twenty-six, increasingly important projects. Selznick discovered and signed a young actress who would quickly become one of the studio's biggest stars, <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>. <a href="John%20Barrymore">John Barrymore</a> was also enlisted for a few memorable performances. From September 1932 on, print advertising for the company's features displayed the revised name "RKO Radio Pictures"; the Pathé name was used only for newsreels and documentaries. That year, the New York City–based corporate headquarters moved into the new RKO Building, an <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> skyscraper that was one of the first <a href="Rockefeller%20Center">Rockefeller Center</a> structures to open.

Selznick spent a mere fifteen months as RKO production chief, resigning over a dispute with new corporate president Merlin Aylesworth concerning creative control. One of his last acts at RKO was to approve a <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a> for a thirty-three-year-old, balding <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> song-and-dance man named <a href="Fred%20Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>. In a memo, Selznick wrote, "I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is ... tremendous". Selznick's tenure was widely considered masterful: In 1931, before he arrived, the studio had produced forty-two features for $16 million in total budgets. In 1932, under Selznick, forty-one features were made for $10.2 million, with clear improvement in quality and popularity. He backed several major successes, including "<a href="A%20Bill%20of%20Divorcement%20%281932%20film%29">A Bill of Divorcement</a>" (1932), with Cukor directing Hepburn's debut, and the monumental "<a href="King%20Kong%20%281933%20film%29">King Kong</a>" (1933)—largely Merian Cooper's brainchild, brought to life by the astonishing <a href="special%20effects">special effects</a> work of <a href="Willis%20O%27Brien">Willis O'Brien</a>. Still, the shaky finances and excesses that marked the company's pre-Selznick days had not left RKO in shape to withstand the <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>; in early 1933, the studio sank into <a href="receivership">receivership</a>, from which it did not emerge until 1940.

Cooper took over as production head after Selznick's departure and oversaw two hits starring Hepburn: "<a href="Morning%20Glory%20%281933%20film%29">Morning Glory</a>" (1933), for which she won her <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">first Oscar</a>, and "<a href="Little%20Women%20%281933%20film%29">Little Women</a>" (1933), director Cukor's second collaboration with the actress. Among the studio's in-house productions, the latter was the biggest box-office success of the decade. <a href="Ginger%20Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a> had already made several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven-year contract and cast her in the big-budget musical "<a href="Flying%20Down%20to%20Rio">Flying Down to Rio</a>" (1933). Rogers was paired with <a href="Fred%20Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>, making his movie debut. Billed fourth and fifth respectively, the picture turned them into stars. <a href="Hermes%20Pan%20%28choreographer%29">Hermes Pan</a>, assistant to the film's dance director, would become one of Hollywood's leading choreographers through his subsequent work with Astaire.

Along with <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, RKO became one of the primary homes of the <a href="Screwball%20comedy%20film">screwball comedy</a>. As film historian James Harvey describes, compared to their richer competition, the two studios were "more receptive to experiment, more tolerant of chaos on the set. It was at these two lesser 'majors'...that nearly all the preeminent screwball directors did their important films—<a href="Howard%20Hawks">[Howard] Hawks</a> and <a href="Gregory%20La%20Cava">[Gregory] La Cava</a> and <a href="Leo%20McCarey">[Leo] McCarey</a> and <a href="George%20Stevens">[George] Stevens</a>." The relatively unheralded <a href="William%20A.%20Seiter">William A. Seiter</a> directed the studio's first significant contribution to the genre, "The Richest Girl in the World" (1934). The drama "<a href="Of%20Human%20Bondage%20%281934%20film%29">Of Human Bondage</a>" (1934), directed by <a href="John%20Cromwell%20%28director%29">John Cromwell</a>, was <a href="Bette%20Davis">Bette Davis</a>'s first great success. Stevens's "<a href="Alice%20Adams%20%28film%29">Alice Adams</a>" and director <a href="John%20Ford">John Ford</a>'s "<a href="The%20Informer%20%281935%20film%29">The Informer</a>" were each nominated for the 1935 Best Picture Oscar—the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a> statuette won by Ford was the only one ever given for an RKO production. "The Informer"'s star, <a href="Victor%20McLaglen">Victor McLaglen</a>, also took home an Academy Award; he would appear in a dozen movies for the studio over a span of two decades.

Lacking the financial resources of industry leaders <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>, <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount</a>, and <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">Fox</a>, RKO turned out many pictures during the era that made up for it with high style in an Art Deco mode, exemplified by such Astaire–Rogers musicals as "<a href="The%20Gay%20Divorcee">The Gay Divorcee</a>" (1934), their first pairing as leads, and "<a href="Top%20Hat">Top Hat</a>" (1935). One of the figures most responsible for that style was another Selznick recruit: <a href="Van%20Nest%20Polglase">Van Nest Polglase</a>, chief of RKO's highly regarded <a href="Production%20designer">design department</a> for almost a decade. Film historian <a href="James%20Naremore">James Naremore</a> has described RKO as "chiefly a designer's studio. It never had a stable of important actors, writers, or directors, but ... it was rich in artists and special-effects technicians. As a result, its most distinctive pictures contained a strong element of fantasy—not so much the fantasy of horror, which during the thirties was the province of <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal</a>, but the fantasy of the marvelous and adventurous."

As a group, the studio's craft divisions were among the strongest in the industry. <a href="Costume%20design">Costumer</a> <a href="Walter%20Plunkett">Walter Plunkett</a>, who worked with the company from the close of the FBO era through the end of 1939, was known as the top <a href="period%20piece">period</a> wardrobist in the business. Sidney Saunders, innovative head of the studio's paint department, was responsible for significant progress in <a href="rear%20projection%20effect">rear projection</a> quality. On June 13, 1935, RKO premiered the first feature film shot entirely in advanced <a href="technicolor%23Three-strip%20Technicolor">three-strip Technicolor</a>, "<a href="Becky%20Sharp%20%28film%29">Becky Sharp</a>". The movie was coproduced with Pioneer Pictures, founded by Cooper—who departed RKO after two years helming production—and <a href="John%20Hay%20Whitney">John Hay "Jock" Whitney</a>, who brought in his cousin <a href="Cornelius%20Vanderbilt%20Whitney">Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney</a>; Cooper had successfully encouraged the Whitneys to purchase a major share of the Technicolor business as well. Although judged by critics a failure as drama, "Becky Sharp" was widely lauded for its visual brilliance and technical expertise. RKO also employed some of the industry's leading artists and craftsmen whose work was never seen. From the studio's earliest days through late 1935, <a href="Max%20Steiner">Max Steiner</a>, regarded by many historians as the most influential composer of the early years of sound cinema, made music for over 100 RKO films. Murray Spivak, head of the studio's audio special effects department, made important advances in the use of rerecording technology first heard in "King Kong".

In October 1935 the ownership team expanded, with financier <a href="Floyd%20Odlum">Floyd Odlum</a> leading a syndicate that bought 50 percent of RCA's stake in the company; the <a href="Rockefeller%20family">Rockefeller brothers</a>, also major stockholders, increasingly became involved in the business. While RKO kept missing the mark in building Hepburn's career, major stars <a href="Cary%20Grant">Cary Grant</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a> joined the studio's roster—though Stanwyck would have little success during her few years there. Grant was a trendsetter, one of the first leading men of the sound era to work extensively as a freelancer, under nonexclusive studio deals, while his star was still on the rise. <a href="Ann%20Sothern">Ann Sothern</a> starred in seven RKO films between 1935 and 1937, paired five times with <a href="Gene%20Raymond">Gene Raymond</a>.
Soon after the appointment of a new production chief, Samuel Briskin, in late 1935, RKO entered into an important distribution deal with animator <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> (Van Beuren consequently folded its cartoon operations). From 1936 to 1954, the studio released his features and shorts; "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>" (1937) was the highest-grossing movie in the period between "<a href="The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Nation">The Birth of a Nation</a>" (1915) and "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" (1939). Following the change in print branding a few years earlier, the opening and closing logos on RKO movies, other than the Pathé nonfiction line, were changed from "Radio Pictures" to "RKO Radio Pictures" in 1936. In February 1937, Selznick, now a leading independent producer, took over RKO's Culver City studio and <a href="RKO%20Forty%20Acres">Forty Acres</a>, as the backlot was known, under a long-term lease. "Gone with the Wind", his coproduction with <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>, was largely shot there. In addition to its central Hollywood studio, RKO production now revolved around its <a href="Movie%20ranch%23RKO%20Encino%20Ranch">Encino ranch</a>. While the Disney association was beneficial, RKO's own product was widely seen as declining in quality and Briskin was gone by the end of the year.

Pandro Berman—who had filled in on three previous occasions—accepted the position of production chief on a noninterim basis. As it turned out, he would leave the job before the decade's turn, but his brief tenure resulted in some of the most notable films in studio history, including "<a href="Gunga%20Din%20%28film%29">Gunga Din</a>", with Grant and McLaglen; "<a href="Love%20Affair%20%281939%20film%29">Love Affair</a>", starring Dunne and <a href="Charles%20Boyer">Charles Boyer</a>; and "<a href="The%20Hunchback%20of%20Notre%20Dame%20%281939%20film%29">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a>" (all 1939). <a href="Charles%20Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>, who gave a now fabled performance as <a href="Quasimodo">Quasimodo</a> in the latter, returned periodically to the studio, headlining six more RKO features. For <a href="Maureen%20O%27Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a>, who made her American screen debut in the film, it was the first of ten pictures she would make for RKO through 1952. After costarring with Ginger Rogers for the eighth time in "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Vernon%20and%20Irene%20Castle">The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle</a>" (1939), Fred Astaire departed the studio.

The studio's B <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Western</a> star of the period was <a href="George%20O%27Brien%20%28Actor%29">George O'Brien</a>, who made eighteen RKO pictures, sixteen between 1938 and 1940. "<a href="The%20Saint%20in%20New%20York%20%28film%29">The Saint in New York</a>" (1938) successfully launched a B detective series featuring the character <a href="Simon%20Templar">Simon Templar</a> that would run through 1943. The Wheeler and Woolsey comedy series ended in 1937 when Woolsey became ill (he died the following year). RKO filled the void by releasing independently produced features such as the <a href="Dr.%20Christian">Dr. Christian</a> series and the <a href="Laurel%20and%20Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a> comedy "<a href="The%20Flying%20Deuces">The Flying Deuces</a>" (1939). The studio soon had its own new B comedy star in <a href="Lupe%20V%C3%A9lez">Lupe Vélez</a>: "<a href="The%20Girl%20from%20Mexico">The Girl from Mexico</a>" (1939) was followed by seven frantic installments of the Mexican Spitfire series, all featuring <a href="Leon%20Errol">Leon Errol</a>, between 1940 and 1943. The studio's technical departments maintained their reputation as industry leaders; Vernon Walker's special effects unit became famous for its sophisticated use of the <a href="optical%20printer">optical printer</a> and lifelike <a href="matte%20%28filmmaking%29">matte</a> work, an art that would reach its apex with 1941's "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>."

Pan Berman had received his first screen credit in 1925 as a nineteen-year-old <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a> on FBO's "Midnight Molly". He departed RKO in December 1939 after policy clashes with studio president <a href="George%20Schaefer%20%28movie%20producer%29">George J. Schaefer</a>, handpicked the previous year by the Rockefellers and backed by Sarnoff. With Berman gone, Schaefer became in effect production chief, though other men—including the former head of the <a href="Production%20Code">industry censorship board</a>, Joseph I. Breen—nominally filled the role. Schaefer, announcing his philosophy with a new studio slogan, "Quality Pictures at a Premium Price", was keen on signing up independent producers whose films RKO would distribute. In 1941, the studio landed one of the most prestigious independents in Hollywood when it arranged to handle <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a>'s productions. The first two Goldwyn pictures released by the studio were highly successful: "<a href="The%20Little%20Foxes%20%28film%29">The Little Foxes</a>", directed by <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a> and starring Bette Davis, garnered four Oscar nominations, while the Howard Hawks–directed "<a href="Ball%20of%20Fire">Ball of Fire</a>" at last brought <a href="Barbara%20Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a> a hit under the RKO banner. However, Schaefer agreed to terms so favorable to Goldwyn that it was next to impossible for the studio to make money off his films. David O. Selznick loaned out his leading contracted director for two RKO pictures in 1941: Alfred Hitchcock's "<a href="Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Smith%20%281941%20film%29">Mr. and Mrs. Smith</a>" was a modest success and "<a href="Suspicion%20%281941%20film%29">Suspicion</a>" a more substantial one, with an Oscar-winning turn by <a href="Joan%20Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>.

That May, having granted twenty-five-year-old star and director <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> virtually complete creative control over the film, RKO released "Citizen Kane". While it opened to strong reviews and would go on to be hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made, it lost money at the time and brought down the wrath of the <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">Hearst</a> newspaper chain on RKO. The next year saw the commercial failure of Welles's "<a href="The%20Magnificent%20Ambersons%20%28film%29">The Magnificent Ambersons</a>"—like "Kane", critically lauded and overbudget—and the expensive embarrassment of his aborted documentary "<a href="It%27s%20All%20True%20%281942%20film%29">It's All True</a>". The three Welles productions combined to drain $2 million from the RKO coffers, major money for a corporation that had reported an overall deficit of $1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of a bit more than $500,000 in 1941. Many of RKO's other artistically ambitious pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive deal with a major star as well. Rogers, after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her performance in the previous year's "<a href="Kitty%20Foyle%20%28film%29">Kitty Foyle</a>", held out for a freelance contract like Grant's; after 1943, she would appear in just one more RKO production, thirteen years later. On June 17, 1942, Schaefer tendered his resignation. He departed a weakened and troubled studio, but RKO was about to turn the corner. Propelled by the box-office boom of World War II and guided by new management, RKO would make a strong comeback over the next half-decade.

By the end of June 1942, Floyd Odlum had taken over a controlling interest in the company via his <a href="Atlas%20Corporation">Atlas Corporation</a>, edging aside the Rockefellers and Sarnoff. <a href="Charles%20Koerner">Charles Koerner</a>, former head of the RKO theater chain and allied with Odlum, had assumed the title of production chief some time prior to Schaefer's departure. With Schaefer gone, Koerner could actually do the job. Announcing a new corporate motto, "Showmanship in Place of Genius: A New Deal at RKO", a snipe at Schaefer's artistic ambitions in general and his sponsorship of Welles in particular, Koerner brought the studio much-needed stability until his death in February 1946. The change in RKO's fortunes was virtually immediate: corporate profits rose from $736,241 in 1942 (the theatrical division compensating for the studio's $2.34 million deficit) to $6.96 million the following year. The Rockefellers sold off their stock and, early in 1943, RCA dispensed with the last of its holdings in the company as well, cutting David Sarnoff's ties to the studio that was largely his conception. In June 1944, RKO created a television production subsidiary, RKO Television Corporation, to provide content for the new medium. RKO became the first major studio to produce for television with "Talk Fast, Mister", a one-hour drama filmed at RKO-Pathé studios in New York and broadcast by the <a href="DuMont%20Television%20Network">DuMont</a> network's New York station, <a href="WNYW">WABD</a>, on December 18, 1944. In collaboration with Mexican businessman <a href="Emilio%20Azc%C3%A1rraga%20Vidaurreta">Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta</a>, RKO established <a href="Estudios%20Churubusco">Estudios Churubusco</a> in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> in 1945.

With RKO on increasingly secure ground, Koerner sought to increase its output of handsomely budgeted, star-driven features. However, the studio's only remaining major stars under anything like extended contracts were Grant, whose services were shared with Columbia Pictures, and O'Hara, shared with Twentieth Century-Fox. Lacking in-house stars, Koerner and his successors under Odlum arranged with the other studios to loan out their biggest names or signed one of the growing number of freelance performers to short-term, "<a href="Guarantee%20%28filmmaking%29">pay or play</a>" deals. Thus RKO pictures of the mid- and late forties offered <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="Henry%20Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, and others who were out of the studio's price range for extended contracts. <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> appeared in 1943's "<a href="A%20Lady%20Takes%20a%20Chance">A Lady Takes a Chance</a>" while on loan from <a href="Republic%20Pictures">Republic Pictures</a>; he was soon working regularly with RKO, making nine more movies for the studio. <a href="Gary%20Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> appeared in RKO releases produced by Goldwyn and, later, the startup International Pictures, and <a href="Claudette%20Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> starred in a number of RKO coproductions. <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>, on loan out from Selznick, starred opposite <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> in "<a href="The%20Bells%20of%20St.%20Mary%27s">The Bells of St. Mary's</a>" (1945), a coproduction with director <a href="Leo%20McCarey">Leo McCarey</a>. The top box-office film of the year, it turned a $3.7 million profit for RKO, the most in the company's history. Bergman returned in the coproductions "<a href="Notorious%20%281946%20film%29">Notorious</a>" (1946) and "<a href="Stromboli%20%28film%29">Stromboli</a>" (1950), and in the independently produced "<a href="Joan%20of%20Arc%20%281948%20film%29">Joan of Arc</a>" (1948). Freelancing <a href="Randolph%20Scott">Randolph Scott</a> appeared in one major RKO release annually from 1943 through 1948.

In similar fashion, many leading directors made one or more films for RKO during this era, including Alfred Hitchcock once more, with "Notorious", and <a href="Jean%20Renoir">Jean Renoir</a>, with "<a href="This%20Land%20Is%20Mine%20%28film%29">This Land Is Mine</a>" (1943), reuniting Laughton and O'Hara, and "<a href="The%20Woman%20on%20the%20Beach">The Woman on the Beach</a>" (1947). RKO and Orson Welles had an arm's-length reunion via "<a href="The%20Stranger%20%281946%20film%29">The Stranger</a>" (1946), an independent production he starred in as well as directed. Welles would subsequently call it his worst film, but it was the only one he ever made that turned a profit in its first run. In December 1946, the studio released <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>'s "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Wonderful%20Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a>"; while it would ultimately be recognized as one of the greatest films of Hollywood's Golden Age, at the time it lost more than half a million dollars for RKO. John Ford's "<a href="The%20Fugitive%20%281947%20film%29">The Fugitive</a>" (1947) and "<a href="Fort%20Apache%20%28film%29">Fort Apache</a>" (1948), which appeared right before studio ownership changed hands again, were followed by "<a href="She%20Wore%20a%20Yellow%20Ribbon">She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</a>" (1949) and "<a href="Wagon%20Master">Wagon Master</a>" (1950); all four were coproductions between RKO and Argosy, the company run by Ford and RKO alumnus Merian C. Cooper. Of the directors under long-term contract to RKO in the 1940s, the best known was <a href="Edward%20Dmytryk">Edward Dmytryk</a>, who first came to notice with the remarkably profitable "<a href="Hitler%27s%20Children%20%281943%20film%29">Hitler's Children</a>" (1943). Shot on a $205,000 budget, placing it in the bottom quartile of Big Five studio productions, it was one of the ten biggest Hollywood hits of the year. Another low-cost war-themed film directed by Dmytryk, "<a href="Behind%20the%20Rising%20Sun%20%28film%29">Behind the Rising Sun</a>", released a few months later, was similarly profitable.

Much more than the other Big Five studios, RKO relied on B pictures to fill up its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features put out by the other top four studios were budgeted at over half a million dollars. A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while it also limited the potential for reward (Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside), RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and low-cost product than with its A movies. The studio's low-budget films offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them <a href="Mark%20Robson">Mark Robson</a>, <a href="Robert%20Wise">Robert Wise</a>, and <a href="Anthony%20Mann">Anthony Mann</a>. Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer <a href="Val%20Lewton">Val Lewton</a>, whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director <a href="Jacques%20Tourneur">Jacques Tourneur</a>. The Lewton unit's moody, atmospheric work—represented by films such as "<a href="Cat%20People%20%281942%20film%29">Cat People</a>" (1942), "<a href="I%20Walked%20with%20a%20Zombie">I Walked with a Zombie</a>" (1943), and "<a href="The%20Body%20Snatcher%20%28film%29">The Body Snatcher</a>" (1945)—is now highly regarded. Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production "<a href="The%20Ghost%20Ship">The Ghost Ship</a>". <a href="Tim%20Holt">Tim Holt</a> was RKO's cowboy star of the era, appearing in forty-six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio. In 1940, <a href="Chester%20Lauck">Chester Lauck</a> and <a href="Norris%20Goff">Norris Goff</a> brought their famous comic characters <a href="Lum%20and%20Abner">Lum and Abner</a> from radio to RKO for a six-film run. The <a href="The%20Falcon%20%28literary%20character%29">Falcon</a> detective series began in 1941; the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator <a href="Leslie%20Charteris">Leslie Charteris</a> sued RKO. The Falcon was first played by <a href="George%20Sanders">George Sanders</a>, who had appeared five times as the Saint. He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, <a href="Tom%20Conway">Tom Conway</a>. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. <a href="Johnny%20Weissmuller">Johnny Weissmuller</a> starred in six <a href="Tarzan">Tarzan</a> pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by <a href="Lex%20Barker">Lex Barker</a>.

<a href="Film%20noir">Film noir</a>, to which lower budgets lent themselves, became something of a house style at the studio, indeed, the RKO B "<a href="Stranger%20on%20the%20Third%20Floor">Stranger on the Third Floor</a>" (1940) is widely seen as initiating noir's classic period. Its <a href="cinematography">cinematographer</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Musuraca">Nicholas Musuraca</a>, who began at FBO in the 1920s and stayed with RKO through 1954, is a central figure in creating the look of classic noir. Design chief <a href="Albert%20S.%20D%27Agostino">Albert D'Agostino</a>—another long-termer, who succeeded Van Nest Polglase in 1941—and <a href="Art%20director%23Film">art director</a> Walter Keller, along with others in the department, such as art directors <a href="Carroll%20Clark">Carroll Clark</a> and <a href="Jack%20Okey">Jack Okey</a> and <a href="set%20decorator">set decorator</a> <a href="Darrell%20Silvera">Darrell Silvera</a>, are similarly credited. The studio's 1940s list of contract players was filled with noir regulars: <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a> (who graduated to major star status) and <a href="Robert%20Ryan">Robert Ryan</a> each made no fewer than ten film noirs for RKO. <a href="Gloria%20Grahame">Gloria Grahame</a>, <a href="Jane%20Greer">Jane Greer</a>, and <a href="Lawrence%20Tierney">Lawrence Tierney</a> were also notable studio players in the field. Freelancer <a href="George%20Raft">George Raft</a> starred in two noir hits: "<a href="Johnny%20Angel">Johnny Angel</a>" (1945) and "<a href="Nocturne%20%281946%20film%29">Nocturne</a>" (1946). Tourneur, Musuraca, Mitchum, and Greer, along with D'Agostino's design group, joined to make the A-budgeted "<a href="Out%20of%20the%20Past">Out of the Past</a>" (1947), now considered one of the greatest of all film noirs. <a href="Nicholas%20Ray">Nicholas Ray</a> began his directing career with the noir "<a href="They%20Live%20by%20Night">They Live by Night</a>" (1948), the first of a number of well-received films he made for RKO.

RKO, and the movie industry as a whole, had its most profitable year ever in 1946. A Goldwyn production released by RKO, "<a href="The%20Best%20Years%20of%20Our%20Lives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a>", was the most successful Hollywood film of the decade and won that year's <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>. But the legal status of the industry's reigning business model was increasingly being called into doubt: the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> ruled in "<a href="Bigelow%20v.%20RKO%20Radio%20Pictures%2C%20Inc.">Bigelow v. RKO</a>" that the company was liable for damages under <a href="United%20States%20antitrust%20law">antitrust statutes</a> for having denied an independent movie house access to <a href="first%20run%20films">first run films</a>—a common practice among all of the Big Five. With profits at a high point, Floyd Odlum cashed in by selling off about 40 percent of his shares in the company to a group of investment firms. After Koerner's death, Radio-Keith-Orpheum president N. Peter Rathvon and RKO Radio Pictures president Ned Depinet had exchanged positions, with Depinet moving to the corporate offices in New York and Rathvon relocating to Hollywood and doubling as production chief while a permanent replacement was sought for Koerner. On the first day of 1947, producer and Oscar-winning screenwriter <a href="Dore%20Schary">Dore Schary</a>, who had been working at the studio on loan from Selznick, took over the role.

RKO appeared in good shape to build on its recent successes, but the year brought a number of unpleasant harbingers for all of Hollywood. The British government imposed a 75 percent tax on films produced abroad; along with similarly confiscatory taxes and quota laws enacted by other countries, this led to a sharp decline in foreign revenues. The postwar attendance boom peaked sooner than expected and television emerged as a competitor for audience interest. Across the board, profits fell—a 27 percent drop for the Hollywood studios from 1946 to 1947. The phenomenon that would become known as <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> was building strength, and in October, the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC) began hearings into Communism in the motion picture industry. Two of RKO's top talents, Dmytryk and producer <a href="Adrian%20Scott">Adrian Scott</a>, refused to cooperate. As a consequence, they were fired by RKO per the terms of the <a href="Waldorf%20Statement">Waldorf Statement</a>, the major studios' pledge to "eliminate any subversives". Scott, Dmytryk, and eight others who also defied HUAC—dubbed the <a href="Hollywood%20blacklist%23The%20Hollywood%20Ten">Hollywood Ten</a>—were <a href="Hollywood%20blacklist">blacklisted</a> across the industry. Ironically, the studio's major success of the year was "<a href="Crossfire%20%28film%29">Crossfire</a>", a Scott–Dmytryk film. Odlum concluded it was time to exit the film business, and he put his remaining RKO shares—approximately 25 percent of the outstanding stock—on the market. Before the turn of the year, the Pathé-branded newsreel was sold to Warner Bros. For her performance in "<a href="The%20Farmer%27s%20Daughter%20%281947%20film%29">The Farmer's Daughter</a>" (1947), a coproduction with Selznick's Vanguard Films, <a href="Loretta%20Young">Loretta Young</a> won the Best Actress Oscar the following March. It would turn out to be the last major Academy Award for an RKO picture.

In May 1948, eccentric aviation tycoon and occasional movie producer <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> gained control of the company, beating out British film magnate <a href="J.%20Arthur%20Rank">J. Arthur Rank</a> as the buyer of Odlum's interest. Hughes bought <a href="Atlas%20Corporation">Atlas Corporation</a>'s 929,000 shares for $8,825,000. Hughes promptly fired 700 employees, and RKO production, which had averaged 30 pictures per year, dwindled to 9 the first year Hughes took over. During Hughes's tenure, RKO suffered its worst years since the early 1930s, as his capricious management style took a heavy toll. Production chief Schary quit almost immediately due to his new boss's interference and Rathvon soon followed. Within weeks of taking over, Hughes had dismissed three-fourths of the work force; production was virtually shut down for six months as the conservative Hughes shelved or canceled several of the "<a href="message%20picture">message picture</a>s" that Schary had backed. Once shooting picked up again, Hughes quickly became notorious for meddling in minute production matters, particularly the presentation of actresses he favored. All of the Big Five saw their profits dwindle in 1948—from Fox, down 11 percent, to Loew's/MGM, down 62 percent—but at RKO they virtually vanished: from $5.1 million in 1947 to $0.5 million, a drop of 90 percent. The production-distribution end of the RKO business, now deep in the red, would never make a profit again.

Offscreen, Robert Mitchum's arrest and conviction for marijuana possession—he would serve two months in jail—was widely assumed to mean career death for RKO's most promising young star, but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered. Of much broader significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors by being the first to settle the federal government's antitrust suit against the major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Paramount%20Pictures%2C%20Inc.">United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.</a>" Under the <a href="consent%20decree">consent decree</a> he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations—RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.—with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock in the theater company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce was one of the crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood's <a href="studio%20system">studio system</a>.

While Hughes's time at RKO was marked by dwindling production and a slew of expensive flops, the studio continued to turn out some well-received films under production chiefs <a href="Sid%20Rogell">Sid Rogell</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Bischoff">Sam Bischoff</a>, though both became fed up with Hughes's meddling and quit after less than two years. (Bischoff would be the last man to hold the job under Hughes.) There were B noirs such as "<a href="The%20Window%20%28film%29">The Window</a>" (1949), which turned into a hit, and "<a href="The%20Set-Up%20%281949%20film%29">The Set-Up</a>" (1949), directed by Robert Wise and starring Robert Ryan, which won the Critic's Prize at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. "<a href="The%20Thing%20from%20Another%20World">The Thing from Another World</a>" (1951), a science-fiction drama coproduced with Howard Hawks's Winchester Pictures, is seen as a classic of the genre. In 1952, RKO put out two films directed by <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a>, "<a href="Rancho%20Notorious">Rancho Notorious</a>" and "<a href="Clash%20by%20Night">Clash by Night</a>". The latter was a project of the renowned <a href="Jerry%20Wald">Jerry Wald</a>–<a href="Norman%20Krasna">Norman Krasna</a> production team, lured by Hughes from Warner Bros. with great fanfare in August 1950.

The company also began a close working relationship with <a href="Ida%20Lupino">Ida Lupino</a>. She starred in two suspense films with Robert Ryan—Nicholas Ray's "<a href="On%20Dangerous%20Ground">On Dangerous Ground</a>" (1952, though shooting had been completed two years earlier) and "<a href="Beware%2C%20My%20Lovely">Beware, My Lovely</a>" (1952), a coproduction between RKO and Lupino's company, The Filmakers. Of more historic note, Lupino was Hollywood's only female director during the period; of the five pictures The Filmakers made with RKO, Lupino directed three, including her now celebrated "<a href="The%20Hitch-Hiker%20%281953%20film%29">The Hitch-Hiker</a>" (1953). Exposing many moviegoers to Asian cinema for the first time, RKO distributed <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>'s epochal "<a href="Rashomon%20%28film%29">Rashomon</a>" in the United States, sixteen months after its original 1950 Japanese release. The only smash hits released by RKO in the 1950s came out during this period, but neither was an in-house production: Goldwyn's "<a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen%20%28film%29">Hans Christian Andersen</a>" (1952) was followed by Disney's "<a href="Peter%20Pan%20%281953%20film%29">Peter Pan</a>" (1953).

In early 1952, Hughes fought off a lawsuit by screenwriter <a href="Paul%20Jarrico">Paul Jarrico</a>, who had been caught up in the latest round of HUAC hearings—Hughes had fired him and removed his name from the credits of a recent release. The studio owner subsequently ordered 100 RKO employees on "leave of absence" while he established a "security office" to oversee an ideological vetting system. "We are going to screen everyone in a creative or executive capacity", he declared. "The work of Communist sympathizers will not be used." As more credits were expunged, some in the industry began to question whether Hughes's hunt for subversives served primarily as a convenient rationale for further curtailing production and trimming expenses.

In September, Hughes and his corporate president, Ned E. Depinet, sold their RKO studio stock to a Chicago-based syndicate with no experience in the movie business; the syndicate's chaotic reign lasted until February 1953, when the stock and control were reacquired by Hughes. The studio's net loss in 1952 was over $10 million, and shooting had taken place for just a single in-house production over the last five months of the year. During the turmoil, Samuel Goldwyn ended his 11-year-long distribution deal with RKO. Wald and Krasna escaped their contracts and the studio as well. The deal that brought the team to RKO had called for them to produce sixty features over five years; in just shy of half that time, they succeeded in making four. The Encino ranch shut down permanently in 1953 and the property was sold off. In November, Hughes finally fulfilled his obligations under the 1948 consent decree, divesting RKO Theatres; Albert A. List purchased the controlling interest in the business and renamed it List Industries. Hughes soon found himself the target of no less than five separate lawsuits filed by minority shareholders in RKO, accusing him of malfeasance in his dealings with the Chicago group and a wide array of acts of mismanagement. "RKO's contract list is down to three actors and 127 lawyers", quipped <a href="Dick%20Powell">Dick Powell</a>.

Looking to forestall the impending legal imbroglio, in early 1954 Hughes offered to buy out all of RKO's other stockholders. Convinced that the studio was sinking, and after a dispute with Hughes over the distribution of the first of his "<a href="True-Life%20Adventures">True-Life Adventures</a>" documentaries, Walt Disney ended his arrangement with RKO and set up his own distribution firm, <a href="Buena%20Vista%20Pictures">Buena Vista Pictures</a>. By the end of the year, at a cost of $23.5 million, Hughes had gained near-total control of RKO Pictures, becoming the first virtual sole owner of a studio since Hollywood's pioneer days. Virtual, but not quite actual. Floyd Odlum reemerged to block Hughes from acquiring the 95 percent ownership of RKO stock he needed to write off the company's losses against his earnings elsewhere. Hughes had reneged on his promise to give Odlum first option on buying the RKO theater chain when he divested it and was now paying the price. With negotiations between the two at a stalemate, in July 1955, Hughes turned around and sold RKO Pictures to the <a href="General%20Tire">General Tire and Rubber Company</a> for $25 million. For Hughes, this was the effective end of a quarter-century's involvement in the movie business. Historian Betty Lasky describes Hughes's relationship with RKO as a "systematic seven-year rape."

In taking control of the studio, General Tire restored RKO's links to broadcasting. General Tire had bought the <a href="Yankee%20Network">Yankee Network</a>, a New England regional radio network, in 1943. In 1950, it purchased the West Coast regional <a href="Don%20Lee%20%28broadcaster%29">Don Lee Broadcasting System</a>, and two years later, the <a href="Bamberger%27s%23WOR%20history">Bamberger Broadcasting Service</a>, owner of the <a href="WOR%20%28disambiguation%29">WOR</a> TV and radio stations in New York City. The latter acquisition gave General Tire majority control of the <a href="Mutual%20Broadcasting%20System">Mutual Broadcasting System</a>, one of America's leading radio networks. General Tire then merged its broadcasting interests into a new division, General Teleradio.

Thomas O'Neil, son of General Tire's founder William O'Neil and chairman of the broadcasting group, saw that the company's new television stations, indeed all TV outlets, were in need of programming. With the purchase of RKO, the studio's library was his, and rights to the 742 films to which RKO retained clear title were quickly put up for sale. C&C Television Corp., a subsidiary of beverage maker <a href="Cantrell%20and%20Cochrane">Cantrell & Cochrane</a>, won the bidding in December 1955. It was soon offering the films to independent stations in a package called "MovieTime USA". RKO Teleradio Pictures—the new company created from the merger of General Teleradio and the RKO studio—retained the broadcast rights for the cities where it owned TV stations. By 1956, RKO's classic movies were playing widely on television, allowing many to see such films as "Citizen Kane" for the first time. The $15.2 million RKO made on the deal convinced the other major studios that their libraries held profit potential—a turning point in the way Hollywood did business.

The new owners of RKO made an initial effort to revive the studio, hiring veteran producer <a href="William%20Dozier">William Dozier</a> to head production. In the first half of 1956, the production facilities were as busy as they had been in a half-decade. RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang's final two American films, "<a href="While%20the%20City%20Sleeps%20%281956%20film%29">While the City Sleeps</a>" and "<a href="Beyond%20a%20Reasonable%20Doubt%20%281956%20film%29">Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</a>" (both 1956), but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors, producers, and stars. The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as <a href="Pearl%20of%20the%20South%20Pacific">"Pearl of the South Pacific"</a> (1955) and "<a href="The%20Conqueror%20%281956%20film%29">The Conqueror</a>" (1956) that enchanted Hughes. The latter, starring John Wayne, was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade, but its $4.5 million in North American rentals did not come close to covering its $6 million cost.

After a year and a half without a notable success, General Tire shut down production at RKO for good at the end of January 1957. The Hollywood and Culver City facilities were sold later that year for $6.15 million to <a href="Desilu%20Productions">Desilu Productions</a>, owned by <a href="Desi%20Arnaz">Desi Arnaz</a> and <a href="Lucille%20Ball">Lucille Ball</a>, who had been an RKO contract player from 1935 to 1942. Desilu would be acquired by <a href="Gulf%20and%20Western%20Industries">Gulf and Western Industries</a> in 1967 and merged into G+W's other production company, <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>; the former RKO Hollywood studio became home to Paramount Television (now <a href="CBS%20Television%20Studios">CBS Television Studios</a>), which it remains to this day. The renovated Culver City studio is now owned and operated as an independent production facility. Forty Acres, the Culver City backlot, was razed in the mid-1970s. List Industries, the former RKO Theatres Corp., was acquired by Glen Alden Corp. in 1959. After Glen Alden's 1967 acquisition of the Stanley Warner theater group, the two chains were merged into RKO–Stanley Warner Theatres. <a href="Cinerama">Cinerama</a> purchased the exhibition circuit from Glen Alden in 1971.

With the closing down of production, RKO also shut its distribution exchanges; from 1957 forward, remaining pictures were released through other companies, primarily <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal-International</a>. The final RKO film, "<a href="Verboten%21">Verboten!</a>", a coproduction with director <a href="Samuel%20Fuller">Samuel Fuller</a>'s Globe Enterprises, was released by <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> in March 1959. That same year, "Pictures" was stripped from the corporate identity; the holding company for General Tire's broadcasting operation and the few remaining motion picture assets was renamed <a href="RKO%20General">RKO General</a>. In the words of scholar Richard B. Jewell, "The supreme irony of RKO's existence is that the studio earned a position of lasting importance in cinema history largely "because" of its extraordinarily unstable history. Since it was the weakling of Hollywood's 'majors,' RKO welcomed a diverse group of individualistic creators and provided them...with an extraordinary degree of freedom to express their artistic idiosyncrasies... [I]t never became predictable and it never became a factory." By July 5, 1957, RKO Japan, Ltd. was sold to Disney Productions and British Commonwealth Film Corporation. In allocating the foreign film licenses to RKO Japan, Disney would use 5 and Commonwealth 8.

One of North America's major radio and television broadcasters from the 1950s through the late 1980s, RKO General traces its roots to the 1943 purchase of the <a href="Yankee%20Network">Yankee Network</a> by <a href="General%20Tire">General Tire</a>. In 1952, the company united its newly expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio. With the tire manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media businesses were brought together under the rubric of RKO Teleradio Pictures. In 1959, following the breakup of the movie studio, the media division was given the name it would operate under for the next three decades, RKO General. In addition to its broadcasting activities, RKO General was also the holding company for many of General Tire's (and, after its parent company's reorganization, <a href="GenCorp">GenCorp</a>'s) other noncore businesses, including soft-drink bottling, hotel enterprises, and, for seventeen years, the original <a href="Frontier%20Airlines%20%281950-1986%29">Frontier Airlines</a>.

The RKO General radio lineup included some of the highest rated, most influential popular music stations in North America. In May 1965, <a href="KHJ%20%28AM%29">KHJ (AM)</a> in Los Angeles introduced the <a href="Boss%20Radio">Boss Radio</a> variation of the <a href="top%2040">top 40</a> format. The restrictive programming style was soon adopted by many of RKO's other stations and imitated by non-RKO broadcasters around the country. RKO's FM station in New York pioneered numerous formats under a variety of call letters, including <a href="WRKS-FM%23WOR-FM">WOR</a> and <a href="WRKS-FM%23WXLO%2099X">WXLO</a> ("99X"); in 1983, as <a href="WRKS-FM%23WRKS%2098.7%20Kiss%20FM">WRKS</a> ("98.7 Kiss FM"), it became one of the first major stations to regularly program <a href="hip%20hop%20music">rap music</a>. In 1979, RKO General created the <a href="RKO%20Radio%20Network">RKO Radio Network</a>, reportedly the first broadcasting web linked via satellite.

The company's television stations, for the most part non–network affiliated, were known for showing classic films (both RKO productions and many others) under the banner of "Million Dollar Movie", launched by New York's <a href="WWOR-TV">WOR-TV</a> in 1954. In June 1962, RKO General and <a href="Zenith%20Electronics">Zenith Electronics</a> initiated what became the first extended venture into subscription television service: through early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's <a href="WUVN">WHCT-TV</a> aired movies, sports, classical and pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges. However, RKO General's most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in 1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts. More than two decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp (the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General) to sell off its broadcast holdings under <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">FCC</a> pressure. RKO General exited the media business permanently in 1991.

Beginning with 1981's "<a href="Carbon%20Copy%20%28film%29">Carbon Copy</a>", RKO General became involved in the coproduction of a number of feature films and TV projects through a subsidiary created three years earlier, RKO Pictures Inc. In collaboration with Universal Studios, RKO put out five films over the next three years. Although the studio frequently worked with major names—including <a href="Burt%20Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a> and <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a> in "<a href="The%20Best%20Little%20Whorehouse%20in%20Texas%20%28film%29">The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</a>", <a href="Jack%20Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> in "<a href="The%20Border%20%281982%20film%29">The Border</a>", and <a href="Nastassja%20Kinski">Nastassja Kinski</a> in "<a href="Cat%20People%20%281982%20film%29">Cat People</a>" (all 1982)—it met with little success. Starting with the <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a> vehicle "<a href="Plenty%20%28film%29">Plenty</a>" (1985), RKO took on more projects as sole studio backer. Films such as the erotic thriller "<a href="Half%20Moon%20Street%20%28film%29">Half Moon Street</a>" (1986) and the Vietnam War drama "<a href="Hamburger%20Hill">Hamburger Hill</a>" (1987) followed, but production ended as GenCorp underwent a massive reorganization following an attempted hostile takeover. With RKO General dismantling its broadcast business, RKO Pictures Inc., along with the original RKO studio's <a href="trademark">trademark</a>, <a href="remake">remake</a> rights, and other remaining assets, was spun off and put up for sale. After a bid by RKO Pictures' own management team failed, the managers made a deal with <a href="Wesray%20Capital%20Corporation">Wesray Capital Corporation</a>—under the control of former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury <a href="William%20E.%20Simon">William E. Simon</a> and <a href="Ray%20Chambers">Ray Chambers</a>—to buy RKO through Entertainment Acquisition Co., a newly created purchasing entity. The sale was completed in late 1987, and Wesray linked RKO with its <a href="Six%20Flags">Six Flags</a> amusement parks to form RKO/Six Flags Entertainment Inc.
In 1989, RKO Pictures, which had produced no films while under Wesray control, was spun off yet again. Actress and Post Cereals heiress <a href="Dina%20Merrill">Dina Merrill</a> and her husband, producer <a href="Ted%20Hartley">Ted Hartley</a>, acquired a majority interest and merged the company with their Pavilion Communications. After a brief period as RKO/Pavilion, the business was reorganized as RKO Pictures LLC. With the inaugural RKO production under Hartley and Merrill's ownership, "False Identity" (1990), the company also stepped into the distribution business. In 1992, it handled the well-regarded independent production "<a href="Laws%20of%20Gravity%20%28film%29">Laws of Gravity</a>", directed by <a href="Nick%20Gomez">Nick Gomez</a>. RKO's next significant release came in 1998 with "<a href="Mighty%20Joe%20Young%20%281998%20film%29">Mighty Joe Young</a>", a remake of a <a href="Mighty%20Joe%20Young%20%281949%20film%29">1949 RKO movie</a> that was itself something of a "King Kong" redux. In the early 2000s, the company was involved as a coproducer on TV movies and modestly budgeted features at the rate of about one annually. In 2003, RKO coproduced a Broadway stage version of the 1936 Astaire–Rogers vehicle "<a href="Swing%20Time%20%28film%29">Swing Time</a>", under the title "Never Gonna Dance".

In 2003, as well, RKO Pictures entered into a legal battle with Wall Street Financial Associates (WSFA). Hartley and Merrill claimed that the owners of WSFA fraudulently induced them into signing an acquisition agreement by concealing their "cynical and rapacious" plans to purchase RKO with the intention only of dismantling it. WSFA sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting RKO's majority owners from selling their interests in the company to any third parties. The WSFA motion was denied in July 2003, freeing RKO to deal with another potential purchaser, InternetStudios.com. In 2004, that planned sale fell through when InternetStudios.com apparently folded. The company's minimal involvement in new film production continued to focus on its remake rights: "<a href="Are%20We%20Done%20Yet%3F">Are We Done Yet?</a>", based on "<a href="Mr.%20Blandings%20Builds%20His%20Dream%20House">Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House</a>" (1948), was released in April 2007 to dismal reviews. In 2009, "<a href="Beyond%20a%20Reasonable%20Doubt%20%282009%20film%29">Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</a>", a remake of a <a href="Beyond%20a%20Reasonable%20Doubt%20%281956%20film%29">1956 RKO film</a> directed by Fritz Lang, fared even worse critically, receiving a 7% rating on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. Two years before, RKO had announced the launching of a horror division, Roseblood Movie Company. By early 2010, Roseblood's mission had expanded, according to the RKO website, to encompass the "popular horror/thriller genre ... youth-oriented feature-length motion pictures that are edgy, sensuous, scary and commercial" A stage version of "Top Hat" toured Great Britain in the second half of 2011. The most recent RKO film coproductions are the well-received "<a href="A%20Late%20Quartet">A Late Quartet</a>" (2012) and the 2015 flop "<a href="Barely%20Lethal">Barely Lethal</a>".

As copyright holder, RKO Pictures LLC is the owner of all the trademarks and <a href="logos">logos</a> connected with RKO Radio Pictures Inc., as well as the rights concerning stories, <a href="screenplays">screenplays</a> (including 800 to 900 unproduced scripts), remakes, <a href="sequels">sequels</a>, and <a href="prequels">prequels</a> connected with the RKO library. The television, video, and theatrical distribution rights, however, are in other hands: The U.S. and Canadian TV—and consequently, video—rights to most of the RKO film library were sold at auction in 1971 after the holders, TransBeacon (a corporate descendant of C&C Television), went bankrupt. The auctioned rights were split between <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> and Marian B. Inc. (MBI). In 1984, MBI created a subsidiary, Marian Pictures Inc. (MBP), to which it transferred its share of the RKO rights. Two years later GenCorp's subsidiaries, RKO General and RKO Pictures, repurchased the rights then controlled by MBP.

In the meantime, United Artists had been acquired by MGM. In 1986, <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM/UA</a>'s considerable library, including its RKO rights, was bought by <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">Turner Broadcasting System</a> for its new <a href="Turner%20Entertainment">Turner Entertainment</a> division. When Turner announced plans to <a href="Film%20colorization">colorize</a> ten of the RKO films, GenCorp resisted, claiming copyright infringement, leading to both sides filing lawsuits. During RKO Pictures' brief Wesray episode, Turner acquired many of the distribution rights that had returned to RKO via MBP, as well as both the theatrical rights and the TV rights originally held back from C&C for the cities where RKO owned stations. The new owners of RKO also allowed Turner to move forward with colorization of the library. Early in 1989, Turner declared that no less than the historic "Citizen Kane" would be colorized; upon review of Welles's ironclad creative contract with RKO, however, that plan was abandoned. In October 1996, Turner Broadcasting was merged into Time Warner (now <a href="WarnerMedia">WarnerMedia</a>), which now controls distribution of the bulk of the RKO library in North America.

Ownership of the major European TV and video distribution rights to RKO's library is divided on a virtual country-by-country basis: In the UK, many of the RKO rights are currently held by <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Studios</a>. In 1981, <a href="RAI">RAI</a>, the public broadcasting service, acquired the Italian rights to the RKO library, which it now shares with <a href="Silvio%20Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a>'s <a href="Fininvest">Fininvest</a>. In France, the rights are held by Ariès. The German rights were acquired in 1969 by KirchGruppe on behalf of its KirchMedia division, which went bankrupt in 2002. EOS Entertainment's Beta Film purchased many of KirchMedia's rights in 2004, and the library is now distributed by Kineos, created in 2005 as a Beta Film–KirchMedia joint venture.

The Disney pictures originally distributed by RKO are owned and fully controlled by <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>. Rights to many other independent productions distributed by the studio, as well as some notable coproductions, are in new hands. Most <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> films are administered by Warner Bros. in North America and <a href="Miramax">Miramax</a> internationally. "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Wonderful%20Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a>", coproduced by <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>'s <a href="Liberty%20Films">Liberty Films</a>, and "<a href="The%20Bells%20of%20St.%20Mary%27s">The Bells of St. Mary's</a>", coproduced by <a href="Leo%20McCarey">Leo McCarey</a>'s Rainbow Productions, are now owned by <a href="Viacom">Viacom</a>, through its indirect acquisition of <a href="Republic%20Pictures%23Aftermath">Republic Pictures</a>, the former <a href="National%20Telefilm%20Associates">National Telefilm Associates</a>.

Eighteen films produced by RKO itself in 1930–31, including "<a href="Dixiana%20%28film%29">Dixiana</a>", were also allowed to fall into the public domain, as were several later in-house productions, including high-profile releases such as "<a href="The%20Animal%20Kingdom">The Animal Kingdom</a>", "<a href="Bird%20of%20Paradise%20%281932%20film%29">Bird of Paradise</a>," "<a href="Of%20Human%20Bondage%20%281934%20film%29">Of Human Bondage</a>", "<a href="Love%20Affair%20%281939%20film%29">Love Affair</a>", "<a href="The%20Hunchback%20of%20Notre%20Dame%20%281939%20film%29">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a>", and "<a href="They%20Knew%20What%20They%20Wanted%20%28film%29">They Knew What They Wanted</a>".

Most of the films released by RKO Pictures between 1929 and 1957 have an opening ident displaying the studio's famous trademark, the spinning globe and radio tower, nicknamed the "Transmitter." It was inspired by a two-hundred-foot tower built in Colorado for a giant electrical amplifier, or <a href="Tesla%20coil">Tesla coil</a>, created by inventor <a href="Nikola%20Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>. Orson Welles referred to the design as his "favorite among the old idents, not just because it was so often a reliable portent. ... It reminds us to listen." The studio's closing ident, a triangle enclosing a thunderbolt, was also a well-known trademark. Instead of the Transmitter, many <a href="Disney">Disney</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn">Goldwyn</a> films released by the studio originally appeared with colorful versions of the RKO closing ident as part of the main title sequence. For decades, re-releases of these films had <a href="Disney">Disney</a>/<a href="Walt%20Disney%20Studios%20Motion%20Pictures">Buena Vista</a> and <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>/<a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn">Goldwyn</a> ident replacing the RKO insignia, but the originals have been restored in many recent Blu-ray and DVD editions. The Hartley–Merrill RKO Pictures has created new versions of the Transmitter and the closing thunderbolt ident.

George Headley

George Alphonso Headley <a href="Order%20of%20Distinction">OD</a>, <a href="MBE">MBE</a> (30 May 1909 – 30 November 1983) was a <a href="West%20Indies">West Indian</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played 22 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a>, mostly before the Second World War. Considered one of the best <a href="batsmen">batsmen</a> to play for the West Indies and one of the greatest cricketers of all time, Headley also represented <a href="Jamaica%20national%20cricket%20team">Jamaica</a> and played professional club cricket in England. West Indies had a weak cricket team through most of Headley's playing career; as their one world-class player, he carried a heavy responsibility and the side depended on his batting. He batted <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Top%20order">at number three</a>, scoring 2,190 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> in Tests at an <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">average</a> of 60.83, and 9,921 runs in all first-class matches at an average of 69.86. He was chosen as one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1934.

Headley was born in <a href="Panama">Panama</a> but raised in Jamaica where he quickly established a cricketing reputation as a batsman. He soon gained his place in the Jamaican cricket team, and narrowly missed selection for the West Indies tour of England in 1928. He made his Test debut in 1930, against <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> in <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, and was instantly successful. Further successes followed in series against Australia and in three more against England, as Headley dominated the West Indian batting of the period. Following his tour of England in 1933, Headley signed as a professional at <a href="Haslingden%20Cricket%20Club">Haslingden</a> in the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29">Lancashire League</a>, where he played until the outbreak of war in 1939.

The war interrupted Headley's career; although he returned to Tests in 1948 he was hampered by injuries and did not achieve his previous levels of success. Even so, he was chosen as West Indies captain in 1948 against England, the first black player to be appointed to the position, although a combination of injuries and politics meant he only led his team for one Test match. He did not play Tests between 1949 and 1953, but resumed his career in English league cricket, first in Lancashire and later in the Birmingham League. His playing career ended in 1954 on his return to Jamaica, after a public subscription paid his fare from England. After retiring as a player, Headley was employed as a cricket coach by the Jamaican government until 1962. He lived until 1983; his son <a href="Ron%20Headley">Ron</a> and his grandson <a href="Dean%20Headley">Dean</a> each played Test match cricket, for West Indies and England respectively.

Headley was born in <a href="Col%C3%B3n%2C%20Panama">Colón, Panama</a> on 30 May 1909, the son of DeCourcy Headley and Irene Roberts. Neither of Headley's parents was from Panama; his father was from Barbados and his mother from Jamaica, but they had moved to Panama while DeCourcey worked on the construction of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>. By the time Headley was five years old the Canal was complete, and the family moved to Cuba in search of further employment. In 1919, concerned by the amount of Spanish being spoken by her son, Headley's mother took him to Jamaica so he could be educated in an English-speaking school.

Headley moved in with his mother's sister-in-law Mrs Clarence Smith, in Rae Town, <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston</a>, and remained with her until her death in 1933. His mother returned to Cuba, but regularly exchanged letters with her son. He attended Calabar Elementary School, where he played for the school cricket team as a <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a>, although a meagre sporting budget meant he had to do so without gloves. Later, he continued his education at Kingston High School. Taking part in all-day cricket matches at the local Crabhole Park, Headley began to attract local attention, and aged 16, he joined Raetown Cricket Club. In 1925 he scored his first century, batting at number three in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">batting order</a> in a match for Raetown against Clovelly.

On leaving school, Headley was appointed as a temporary clerk in a magistrate's court; this enabled him to play competitive cricket for the St Andrew's Police side in 1926, in a cup competition. Some impressive performances for the club earned him an invitation to practice with the Jamaica Colts team. However, his job made it impossible to attend, and he was not considered for <a href="Jamaica%20national%20cricket%20team">the Jamaican side</a> against <a href="Lionel%20Tennyson%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Tennyson">Lord Tennyson</a>'s English touring side in 1927. That year, Headley began working for Keeling–Lindo Estates, in <a href="Saint%20Catherine%20Parish">St Catherine</a>. The firm were enthusiastic cricket patrons, allowing employees time off to play in matches, so that Headley was able to attend practice with the Jamaica team on a regular basis. He also moved to the St Catherine Cricket Club, captained by his immediate superior in Keeling–Lindo. To generate more income, Headley took a second job, working for the Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Company, but he wanted a secure profession. To this end, he planned to move to America to pursue a career in dentistry. However, he was now on the verge of the Jamaica team and a delay in the arrival of the application forms for his American work permit allowed him to make his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut for Jamaica against another touring team led by Lord Tennyson.

Headley made his Jamaica debut against Lord Tennyson's XI at <a href="Sabina%20Park">Sabina Park</a> on 9 February 1928, in a match won easily by the home team. Batting at number three, his first innings yielded 16 runs, but in the second innings, he scored 71, reaching fifty runs in as many minutes. In the second game against Lord Tennyson's XI which began in Kingston on 18 February, Headley scored his maiden first-class <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>. Having scored 22 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> after the first day's play, he reached 50 runs by playing very carefully but subsequently played more adventurous shots. He hit the bowling of Alan Hilder for four consecutive <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29">fours</a> and twice hit Lord Tennyson for three fours in a row. At one point, thirteen of his scoring shots in a row went for four. He was finally out for 211, the highest score at the time by a West Indian batsman against an English team. After the innings, Tennyson compared Headley to <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Macartney">Charlie Macartney</a>, batsmen considered among the best who ever played. Headley concluded the series against Tennyson's team with innings of 40 and 71, to give him an aggregate of 409 runs at an <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">average</a> of 81.80. He also took his maiden first class <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wicket</a>.

Following his success, Headley abandoned his prospective career in dentistry. Although some critics expected his selection for the West Indies tour of England in 1928, Headley was not chosen. While West Indies played their inaugural Test series during that tour, Headley continued to play for St Catherine's. He had another opportunity against English opposition in 1929, when a team led by <a href="Julien%20Cahn">Julien Cahn</a> arrived to play two first-class games. Jamaica's distance from other Caribbean islands made it difficult for their cricketers to gain good-quality playing experience, so the frequent visits by English sides were important to the development of Jamaican cricket. These tours also served to build Headley's reputation. In the first match, Headley played a slow, defensive innings of 57, but he did not reach fifty in his other three innings. Even so, he was chosen by the Jamaican selectors for a West Indies XI, which included players from other islands, to play Cahn's team in their final tour match. The home side lost the toss and had to bat in very difficult conditions following rain. Headley found the fast bowlers difficult, but survived the period when the <a href="Cricket%20pitch">pitch</a> was most difficult to bat on before he was out for 44. In the second innings, he attacked from the start and used a wide range of <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Batting%20technique%20and%20strokeplay">shots</a> to reach 143 before he was <a href="run%20out">run out</a>. In three matches against the tourists, Headley <a href="Scoring%20runs%20in%20cricket">scored</a> 326 runs, averaging 54.33.

A change in the location of his job meant that Headley moved to the <a href="Lucas%20Cricket%20Club">Lucas Cricket Club</a> in 1929. He visited America and played some exhibition matches for the Jamaican Athletic Club in New York, scoring a century against a touring team from Bermuda; his parents had moved to America by then, which enabled Headley to combine the cricket with his first visit to his parents in ten years.

In 1930 the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) undertook a tour of the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing. The first Test was played in Barbados and Headley was selected, making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930—to the disapproval of some Barbadians who thought his place should have gone to a local player. Batting at number three, he played aggressively in the first innings but the crowd barracked him and he was bowled for 21. However, in the second innings he scored 176, becoming the first West Indian to score a century on his Test debut and only their second centurion overall. He shared century <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnerships</a> with both <a href="Clifford%20Roach">Clifford Roach</a> and <a href="Frank%20de%20Caires">Frank de Caires</a>, but these were insufficient to force victory, and the match was drawn. Headley remained in the Test side for the rest of the series, the only home player other than Roach to appear in all four Tests. In Trinidad, during the second Test, Headley found the unfamiliar conditions difficult—Trinidad was the only Test match ground in the Caribbean which was played on a pitch made from matting instead of grass. Headley scored eight and 39 as West Indies lost the match. The home side levelled the series with their first ever Test victory in the third match of the series, played in British Guiana. In this match Headley became the first West Indian, and only the fifth cricketer of any nation, to score two separate hundreds in a Test match. His first innings of 114 was played mainly in support of Roach, who scored a double century. In the second innings, Headley scored 112 as West Indies batted with a big first innings lead, attacking defensive English bowling.

While en route to the final Test in Jamaica, the West Indies team stopped in Panama and Costa Rica where official functions were held in Headley's honour. In Jamaica, where there was widespread jubilation, Headley attended several receptions and celebrations. When the cricket resumed, Headley scored 64, 72 and 55 in three innings against MCC for Jamaica. With the Test series level, it was agreed that the final match of the series would be played until one team won, regardless of how long it took—the other Tests had been limited to four days each. On the first three days, England scored 849. In reply West Indies could only manage 286, with Headley out for ten runs. England batted again, to set West Indies an eventual victory target of 836. This time, Headley batted for 390 minutes, faced 385 <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">balls</a> and hit 28 fours while scoring 223. He and <a href="Karl%20Nunes">Karl Nunes</a> added 227 for the second wicket. Headley played the hook very effectively and hit many short deliveries for runs. When Headley was <a href="stumped">stumped</a>, he had made what was at the time the fourth highest individual score in all Test cricket and the highest in a second innings. When West Indies still needed 428 runs, rain fell for two days and the match had to be abandoned after its ninth scheduled day. Headley ended the series with 703 runs at an average of 87.87.

Headley was selected for the West Indian tour of Australia in the 1930–31 season, under the captaincy of <a href="Jackie%20Grant">Jackie Grant</a>. After a brief visit to New Zealand where they played a non-first-class match against <a href="Wellington%20Firebirds">Wellington</a>, the tourists arrived in Sydney. Headley made a good start to the tour and attracted praise from the press in Australia and West Indies. The first match of the Australian leg was against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>, where the West Indians were bowled out for 188 and Headley was stumped for 25. However, his runs came in less than two <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> and <a href="Learie%20Constantine">Learie Constantine</a> later rated this as one of Headley's best innings. In the second innings, Headley made 82, the top score, but could not prevent the tourists losing. The next match was also lost, as <a href="Bert%20Ironmonger">Bert Ironmonger</a> took thirteen wickets in the match for <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a>. In the first innings, Headley scored 131 out of 212, regarded by one critic as one of the best centuries scored on the ground, and top-scored again with 34 in the second innings. By this stage the Australian bowlers had realised that Headley excelled when hitting the ball through the off side, and they began to alter their tactics accordingly. In the final match before the Test series began, against <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a>, Headley had problems playing the Australian bowlers, particularly the <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> of <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a>. The Australians bowled at Headley's <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23Part%20of%20the%20wicket">leg stump</a> with fielders concentrated on the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a>, making it difficult for him to score runs. Headley scored 27 and 16 as his team were heavily defeated. These bowling tactics were used in subsequent matches, and Headley found difficulty in countering them.
At the beginning of the first Test, West Indies were bowled out 296 as Grimmett took seven wickets, including Headley first ball. In the second innings, with West Indies 80 behind, Grimmett again attacked Headley's leg stump. After having his scoring restricted, Headley lost patience and after scoring 11 was stumped, trying to hit Grimmett. Bowled out for 249, West Indies lost by ten wickets. After scoring only three in the following tour match against <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a>, Headley contributed 14 and two in an <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">innings defeat</a> in the second Test. After two heavy Test defeats for the tourists, some critics believed that the series was too one-sided and that some of the five Tests should be cancelled. Headley's poor run of form continued in the West Indian victory over <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a> and, having put on weight, he was also struggling with his fitness. In an effort to overcome Australia's leg stump attack Headley had altered his <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Stance">batting stance</a>; instead of standing at right angles to the bowler, he turned his body more front-on, to enable him to improve his placement of the <a href="cricket%20ball">ball</a> on the leg side. His quick footwork enabled him to alter his position if necessary to play the ball on the off side. He also eliminated from his strokes a risky <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">cover drive</a> he had developed on Caribbean pitches. During the third Test at <a href="The%20Gabba">Brisbane</a>, Headley made his first substantial contribution to the series, after Australia scored 558 batting first. Facing Grimmett's leg side tactics, Headley managed to score freely, and forced Grimmett to alter to an <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23Part%20of%20the%20wicket">off stump</a> attack. With ten fours in total, Headley became the first West Indian to score a century against Australia, and was left 102 not out when West Indies were bowled out for 193. Forced to <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a>, West Indies were dismissed for 148 of which Headley made 28, the highest score of the innings. Ironmonger tricked him into playing the <a href="leg%20glance">leg glance</a> and he was caught by the wicket-keeper who had moved across in anticipation of the shot.

Headley maintained his good form in matches against Victoria and South Australia after the third Test, scoring 77 and 113 in the first match and 75 and 39 in the second. Although neither match was won, the West Indians needed to take only one more wicket to win the first match when it ended drawn, and lost the second by a single wicket. However, the fourth Test was lost by an innings as Ironmonger again caused difficulties for the West Indies batsmen. Headley top-scored with 33 out of the first innings total of 99 but made only 11 on his second attempt, being <a href="dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismissed</a> both times by Ironmonger. By now the tour was making a financial loss, forcing the tourists to take economy measures such as travelling by tram. In conversation with a member of the Australian Board of Control, Headley, Constantine and fellow tourist <a href="Tommy%20Scott%20%28cricketer%29">Tommy Scott</a> suggested the authorities should produce faster pitches to enable the public to see more attacking cricket. It seems this advice may have been heeded; the pitch was faster in a match against New South Wales, won by the West Indians, in which Headley scored 70 and two. In the fifth Test, West Indies won the toss and batted first, which proved an advantage in a match plagued by uncertain weather. Headley and fellow Jamaican <a href="Frank%20Martin%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Martin</a> scored centuries on the first day despite bowling from the Australians which the Jamaican newspaper "<a href="The%20Daily%20Gleaner%20%28Jamaica%29">Daily Gleaner</a>" described as good. Headley, playing Grimmett comfortably by now, batted for 146 minutes, and hit 13 fours. In the course of the innings he achieved the rare feat in Australia of reaching 1,000 first-class runs on the tour. Grant, the West Indies captain, <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared the innings closed</a> after rain had fallen to make the pitch more difficult for batting. Australia were then bowled out for 224, 126 runs behind West Indies. The tourists scored 124 more runs in their second innings, of which Headley made 30, before more rain fell and Grant declared for the second time in the match. Subsequently, the bowlers dismissed Australia for 220 to give West Indies their first win over Australia, although the series ended 4–1 to the home side. Headley scored 336 runs in the Test matches at an average of 37.33, and 1,066 runs at 44.41 in all first-class games.

On their return home, the West Indian players were well received by the public and officials; Headley received praise and once again attended functions arranged in his honour. In Australia <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, the star Australian batsman, praised Headley, particularly for the way in which he had overcome his problems against Grimmett. C. L. R. James, the writer and historian, later wrote that Headley's success demonstrated his mastery of batting. Headley arrived in Australia as a primarily <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Off%20and%20leg%20side%20fields">off-side</a> player which accounted for his difficulty against the Australian bowlers' tactics. However, James notes: "What he did, under fire, so to speak, was to reorganise his batting to meet the new attack." So successful was Headley that he was described by Grimmett as the best on-side batsman against whom the bowler had played.

Headley resumed playing for Lucas on his return to Jamaica, attracting great crowds and high expectations. Once the cricket season ended, he embarked on another trip to America to play exhibition matches, visiting his parents on the journey. On his return for the 1931–32 season, he was appointed captain of Lucas and began preparing for the forthcoming tour of Jamaica by another team led by Lord Tennyson. In addition to his regular practice, Headley began a programme of running and swimming to improve his overall fitness. After performing well in the trial matches for Jamaica, he was selected in the first match against the tourists. Jamaica made an uncertain start, losing five wickets by the time their score reached 215 but Headley had scored 130. He then shared a partnership of 487 for the sixth wicket with <a href="Clarence%20Passailaigue">Clarence Passailaigue</a>; 236 not out after the first day's play, Headley went on to score an unbeaten 344, after batting for 407 minutes and hitting 39 fours. Jamaica totalled 702, and won the match by an innings. During his innings, Headley passed the previous highest score by any West Indian batsman, 304 not out by <a href="Percy%20Tarilton">Percy Tarilton</a> in 1920, and the highest score in the West Indies by any batsman, <a href="Andy%20Sandham">Andy Sandham</a>'s 325 in 1930. His partnership with Passailaigue took 248 minutes, and as of 2015 remains a world record for the highest sixth wicket partnership in a first-class match. The success of two home batsmen led to celebrations in Jamaica and praise from the English bowlers for Headley's batting. Headley continued his success in the second game, opening the batting and top-scoring with 84 in the first innings. In the second innings, opening again, he made 155 not out to guide West Indies to their victory target of 363. In the final match, Headley scored his third century of the series after returning to number three, accumulating 140 of Jamaica's total of 561. Jamaica won the match to win the series 3–0; Headley scored 723 runs at an average of 361.50. In the remainder of the season, Headley led Lucas to victory in the <a href="Senior%20Cup">Senior Cup</a>, scoring a century in the final.

After playing in two trial matches, Headley was selected to <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201933">tour England in 1933</a> under the continuing captaincy of Jackie Grant. The English press speculated on Headley's ability to cope with English conditions, while expecting him to perform to a high standard. In the event, "Wisden" believed he justified the expectations and increased his reputation. In the first match of the tour he scored 52 out of a total of 129 against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, in difficult batting conditions on a <a href="Sticky%20wicket">wet pitch</a>. He scored fifties in each of his next three matches before scoring a century against the MCC during his first appearance at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a>. In the second innings of this match, a short ball from <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a> struck Headley on the chest, and as a result of this injury he missed three games, but when he returned to the team he scored 129 against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a> and 224 not out against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>. A quieter match followed against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>, but Headley reached his second double century of the tour in the match against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a>, which took him past 1,000 runs for the season. Despite Headley's contributions, the West Indians won only one of these matches and subsequently lost the first Test against England by an innings. Headley scored 13 in the West Indies first innings, and his 50 was the highest score when West Indies <a href="Follow-on">followed-on</a>. Critics were impressed by Headley's second innings performance, in which he scored his runs out of 64 added while he was batting. Between the first and second Tests, in matches where conditions were difficult for batting and ideal for spin bowlers, Headley scored three fifties and achieved his side's highest score in each of four innings.

West Indies drew the second Test, avoiding defeat for the first time in a Test in England. Headley scored 169 in 375 minutes with 18 fours, sharing a partnership of 200 in 205 minutes with <a href="Ivan%20Barrow">Ivan Barrow</a>—who became the first West Indian to score a Test century in England, minutes before Headley became the second. When the innings ended, Headley was still not out and the crowd gave him an excellent reception. "Wisden" described Headley's batting as magnificent, displaying "a ready adaptability and perfection of timing." The West Indies bowlers used <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> tactics in the England innings; England's <a href="Edward%20Clark%20%28cricketer%29">Nobby Clark</a> used the tactic in the West Indian second innings, in which Headley scored 24 runs. He was one of the few of his side's batsmen able to resist the bowling tactics.

After scoring an unbeaten 257 in a minor match against Norfolk, Headley scored 89 in his team's victory over Glamorgan and 182 against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>. However, he failed in the third and final Test, scoring nine and 12 as West Indies were defeated by an innings. The tourists thus lost the series 2–0; in the three Tests Headley's aggregate was 277 runs at an average of 55.40, the best figures for the team. After the Test matches were over, Headley had an operation to remove a <a href="sebaceous%20cyst">sebaceous cyst</a> from his forehead and missed several games, before returning for an end-of-season festival match in which he scored 167 against an England XI. When the tour concluded, Headley had scored 2,320 runs with seven hundreds, at an average of 66.28. This was over 1,000 runs more than any other tourist and placed him third in the English first-class batting averages for the season. Ivan Barrow believed Headley reached his batting peak during the tour. He recalled how many bowlers tried to hit his <a href="Pads%23Batting">pads</a> with the ball but Headley simply flicked the ball away. Headley's performances earned him selection as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. The accompanying article called his tour "almost a triumphant march" and described him as "the best batsman the West Indies have ever produced." "Wisden" editor Sydney Southerton also described him as a giant in the team and wrote: "From what we had been told by English players who had been to the West Indies, we were fully prepared for Headley's success, but even so, he astonished most of us." Headley bowled more than he had previously: prior to the tour, he had taken three first class wickets, but took 21 wickets in England at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 34.33, bowling <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>.

During the tour, Headley received news that his aunt had been killed by floods in Kingston which had also destroyed his home. Headley was greatly affected by the news, particularly the nature of her death. Although not able to attend the funeral, he wanted to leave England on an earlier ship than the rest of the team, but this could not be arranged in time.

Following his success in England in 1933, Headley was offered a two-year contract to play professional cricket for <a href="Haslingden%20Cricket%20Club">Haslingden</a> in the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29">Lancashire League</a> for £500 per season, the highest of several offers. The money was far more than he was earning from working as a fruit picker in Jamaica, and after consulting the Jamaican Cricket Board, who advised him to accept, he signed with the club on 8 September 1933. There was a special provision which allowed Headley to be released to play for West Indies. Living in Haslingden where there were few, if any, other black people, Headley faced some prejudice from residents. However, he was generally welcomed and accepted. His first season was in 1934 and his first match was against <a href="Nelson%20Cricket%20Club">Nelson</a>, for whom Headley's West Indian Test colleague Learie Constantine played. Headley had a difficult match. As the professional, he was expected to open the bowling although, as a spinner, he would normally have bowled later in an innings. When he batted he was run out for a <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> by Constantine after facing one <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">delivery</a>, and Haslingden lost the match. After this poor start, Headley scored 1,063 runs in the season at an average of 50.62, with three centuries. He changed his bowling style to <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium pace</a> and took 59 wickets at an average of 16.59. In 1935 he scored over 900 runs at an average of 61.13, and took 34 wickets; his contract was renewed for another two years. In 1936 he again scored over 900 runs, and took 54 wickets. In 1937 he broke the record for most runs scored by any player in a Lancashire League season, accumulating 1,360 at an average of 97.15, with five centuries; he also took 41 wickets. Headley's final two-year contract with the club covered the seasons 1938 and 1940, since he was expected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1939. The war prevented him playing in 1940, so his last season with Haslingden was 1938. Although in that year his overall batting performance declined, to 677 runs at an average of 37.61, he took 76 wickets at 9.70 and had success in the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29%23Worsley%20Cup">Worsley Cup</a> competition, including one innings of 189 not out in a match played over five evenings.

Headley did not play any first-class cricket in the West Indies in 1933–34, but returned to Jamaica in readiness for the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20West%20Indies%20in%201934%E2%80%9335">1934–35 MCC tour</a>. The visiting team, under the captaincy of <a href="Bob%20Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a>, was stronger than English teams that had previously toured the Caribbean; despite some shortcomings, "Wisden" and other critics considered it strong enough for the task in hand.

The first Test in Barbados was badly affected by rain which made the pitch almost impossible to bat on. West Indies batted first and were bowled out for 102; Headley's 44 was the highest score of the match. In reply, England had scored 81 for seven when Wyatt declared in an attempt to make West Indies bat while the pitch was difficult. In the second innings, Headley was out for a duck and Jackie Grant declared when West Indies had scored 51 for six, so that England required 73 to win; they did so after losing six wickets. In the second Test, Headley scored 25 in his first innings; in the second, he adopted a cautious approach as his team led by 44, hitting 93 in 225 minutes. West Indies subsequently bowled out England to win the match and level the series. The rain-affected third Test was drawn, with Headley's 53 his side's top score.

The MCC went to Jamaica for the final leg of their tour. Headley played two matches for Jamaica against the tourists; he failed in the first game but scored 127 in the second. The teams went into the fourth and final Test with the series still level at one win apiece. West Indies batted first, facing accurate bowling. The local press criticised the West Indies batsmen for slow batting on the first day, but Headley scored 132. The "Daily Gleaner" noted that Headley maintained the controlled approach he had established in the season. On the second day, he took his score to 270 not out, and the "Gleaner" described him as "the genius we all know, scoring with all his old freedom and audacity." In total, he batted for 495 minutes and hit 30 fours, recording the highest score by a West Indian batsman. It remained a West Indian record until <a href="Garfield%20Sobers">Garfield Sobers</a> scored 365 not out in 1958, and was the team's highest against England until <a href="Lawrence%20Rowe">Lawrence Rowe</a> scored 302 in 1974. West Indies scored 535 for seven and bowled out England twice to record their first victory in a Test series. Headley contributed 485 runs at an average of 97.00.

Headley returned to England to play for Haslingden in the 1935 English season, and played a single first-class game, scoring a century for Sir L Parkinson's XI against Leicestershire. In the 1935–36 season, the Yorkshire team toured Jamaica, playing three first-class matches, winning one and drawing the others. The touring county considered Headley the key batsman, and targeted him by bowling defensively in an attempt to frustrate him. Headley lost his wicket through impatience in the first match, although he scored a pair of fifties, but scored a century in the third game. In total, he scored 266 runs at an average of 53.20, but Yorkshire won the series after winning the first game, Jamaica's first defeat at home in a first-class game for ten years. The matches were played in a very competitive atmosphere, but scoring was slow and Yorkshire played attritional cricket. During the series, Headley demanded expenses, which were not normally granted to the players. The Jamaican Board were reluctant to pay but Headley pointed out that, as a professional cricketer, he was entitled to the same treatment as the Yorkshire players, whose expenses were provided. The Board eventually relented before the series ended.

In 1936 Headley returned to England, and played no more first-class cricket until the two trial matches for the <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201939">1939 tour of England</a>. These matches were played in Trinidad where it was believed the matting pitches would most closely replicate English conditions; Jamaica played Trinidad and a combination team. When Jamaica's captain, <a href="Noel%20Newton%20Nethersole">Crab Nethersole</a>, withdrew from the tour due to political commitments, Headley led Jamaica in both matches and scored 160 and 103. Subsequently, he was chosen for his second tour of England, under the captaincy of <a href="Rolph%20Grant">Rolph Grant</a>. Headley opened his tour with fifties in his first two matches and by the time the Test series started, although the tourists had lost three matches, he had scored three centuries—103 against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a>, 116 not out in a victory over <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a> and 227 as the tourists defeated Middlesex.

In the first Test, West Indies suffered their only defeat of the series. However, <a href="Norman%20Preston">Norman Preston</a>, the editor of "Wisden", wrote: "the match provided a personal triumph for Headley", as he became only the second cricketer after <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a> to make two hundreds in the same Test match on two separate occasions, having previously done so against England in 1930. He became the first player to score two hundreds in a Lord's Test, a feat not repeated until 1990. In the first innings, Headley scored 106 with 13 fours. After sharing a big partnership with <a href="Jeff%20Stollmeyer">Jeff Stollmeyer</a>, he received little help from the other batsmen. He played cautiously during his 250-minute innings, as he was aware that his team were relying on his success. By the time West Indies batted again, England had established a lead of 127. Headley again batted defensively to score 107, taking two hours to reach 50, as West Indies needed to bat for a long time to secure a draw. However, he scored runs from any loose bowling and batted in all for 230 minutes, hitting eight fours. Preston, writing in "Wisden", believed the West Indians relied too much on Headley's batting. He also noted that Headley had to play cautiously for his team and although he hit powerful shots, "he was not the same dashing batsmen that England knew in 1933." Headley had scored three centuries in consecutive Test innings, but he could not prevent England winning this first Test by eight wickets. He continued to score heavily in the tour matches, making an unbeaten 234 in an innings win over <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, followed by 61 against Yorkshire on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a>, one of the best innings <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> had seen.

The second Test was drawn, after being badly affected by rain. Headley, although troubled by the English bowling on a difficult pitch, top-scored with 51 in West Indies' first innings but the other batsmen contributed little. Headley scored just five in West Indies' brief second innings, bringing to an end a sequence of six fifties in successive Test innings. After the Test, Headley scored 93 against Surrey but failed to reach fifty in his next three games, which included three single figure scores. West Indies needed to win the final Test to level the series and the team established a first-innings lead of 146. Headley played cautiously for 140 minutes, attempting to tire out the bowlers, but was run out for 65 in a misunderstanding with <a href="Vic%20Stollmeyer">Vic Stollmeyer</a>. The remaining batsmen played well, attacking the English bowling. Preston believed this match demonstrated West Indies' ability to compete at the highest level. However, England were able to bat long enough to secure a draw. In the Test series, Headley scored 334 runs at an average of 66.80, but did not play again on the tour after the final Test, as the team were advised to abandon the last seven matches because of the deteriorating political situation in Europe. They arrived in Canada on the day that Britain declared war on Germany. In all first-class matches during the tour, Headley scored 1,745 runs at 72.70, placing him at the top of the season's first-class averages.

"Wisden" judged Headley to be the best batsman of the 1939 season, while other critics rated him among the best batsmen in the world, with favourable comparisons to Bradman. <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a>, a former England captain turned journalist, wrote that Headley's "middle name should be Atlas", suggesting that he carried the team on his shoulders.

Following the outbreak of war, the Lancashire League clubs cancelled professionals' contracts, meaning Headley did not complete his final year with Haslingden. Having returned to Jamaica, he worked in the Labour Department for the government and played cricket for Lucas, enjoying batting success and captaining his team to victory in the Senior Cup on three occasions. Headley continued to play for the team until 1947, when he left to play for the Kensington Club. Unlike other Caribbean teams, Jamaica did not take part in inter-island competition, and although Headley played some exhibition matches in America in 1945, it was not until June 1946 that he took part in his next first-class match. <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago%20national%20cricket%20team">Trinidad</a> played three matches in Jamaica and Headley scored 52 in the second game but only reached his best form when he scored 99 in the third. However, he was successful as a bowler, taking five for 33 in the first game, the only <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">five wicket return</a> of his career. This included a spell of three wickets without conceding a run in 14 deliveries, prompting a pitch invasion by the crowd. Headley also captained Jamaica in the final two matches of the series against Trinidad after the official captain was injured during the home team's win in the first match—the other two were drawn.

Prior to a visit by <a href="Barbados%20national%20cricket%20team">Barbados</a> in March 1947, Headley was officially appointed as Jamaican captain. Previous captains of island teams had been almost exclusively white. Around this time, Headley requested the Jamaican board provide support for low income players with their kit and transport costs. In the first game against Barbados, Headley scored 203 not out and 57 not out, took four for 40 in the tourists' first innings and another wicket in the second. Although the game was drawn, he had recorded Jamaica's highest score in a match between the Caribbean islands. The second match was also drawn; Headley made 79 before he had to retire when he fell and injured his knee. Another American tour followed, in which Headley was accompanied by promising young players, before he led the Jamaican team to British Guiana in October 1947. He played only two innings in the two matches, scoring 36 and 4 not out. A thumb injury in the first match meant he could not bat, although he bowled 44 overs in the game. Headley was verbally abused by a section of the crowd, who disapproved of a black captain; he was also dissatisfied with the impartiality of the umpires. Crab Nethersole, the Jamaican manager for the tour, reported that injuries to key players and the poor attitude of the crowd made the tour difficult, although Headley's captaincy was universally praised.

For reasons related to class and race, it had been unthinkable before the war for the West Indies to appoint a black Test captain, but the postwar world saw social and political changes in the Caribbean. Although opinion was still divided over the merits of a black captain, Headley was appointed as one of the West Indian captains for the series against the England team which toured the Caribbean in 1948. Crab Nethersole, the former Jamaican captain and member of the Board of Control for cricket, argued Headley should be outright captain but a compromise was reached. Headley was scheduled to captain the first and fourth Test matches, played in Barbados and Jamaica, and the white players <a href="Gerry%20Gomez">Gerry Gomez</a> and <a href="John%20Goddard%20%28cricketer%29">John Goddard</a> were given the captaincy of the second and third matches. In the event, Headley only played in the first Test. In the first innings, he scored 29 but strained his back while fielding. Batting towards the end of West Indies' second innings, he scored seven not out. Rain helped England to draw the match. Headley's back caused him to miss the second and third Tests, but he was fit enough to play for Jamaica when the tourists arrived there to play two games against the island before the fourth and final Test. After the first island game, in which he scored 65, Headley's request to miss the second match to rest his back was refused by the Jamaican Board. He scored 36 not out, but aggravated his back pains and he withdrew from the final Test. West Indies won this game under the captaincy of Goddard, who had earlier led West Indies to victory in the third Test. He was subsequently chosen to captain West Indies in India in 1948–49, despite Headley's availability and apparently superior claims to the position.

Selected for the Indian tour after a specific request by the Indian cricket authorities, Headley did not have much success in the early matches and in the drawn first Test he scored only two in a total of 631. West Indies then moved to Pakistan; in a non first-class game Headley took six wickets as a bowler, but then in a match against a representative Pakistan XI he fell and injured his side while attempting to take a catch. He batted in discomfort, scoring 57 not out. This injury meant that he played no further part in the five-match Test series against India. Although he continued to travel with the team, he was unable to play in any further matches until the final game of the tour, when he scored 100 against Ceylon Schools as the tourists travelled home via <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>.

Headley played for the Kensington Club until 1950, when he resumed league cricket in England; he returned for a final season with Kensington in 1955 before retiring from Senior Cup cricket. Meanwhile, he took a new job as an insurance agent. This affected his availability for cricket as he was no longer able to take leave when playing for a team; if he did not work, he received no wages. Consequently, he did not accept the captaincy of Jamaica during the Test trials for the 1950 tour of England and did not travel with the team. Press reaction was unfavourable towards Headley but the West Indies Board still wanted to select him for the tour. However, Headley accepted a contract with <a href="Bacup%20Cricket%20Club">Bacup</a> in the Lancashire League, to replace <a href="Everton%20Weekes">Everton Weekes</a> who was in the touring party.

For Bacup Headley scored 909 runs and took 20 wickets in 1950, before signing to play for <a href="Dudley">Dudley</a> in the Birmingham League in 1951. He and his family moved to Birmingham, and in each the next four seasons Headley averaged over 65 with the bat and under 17 with the ball. In his second season, the club topped the league. In total, he scored 2,878 runs for Dudley and, resuming off spin bowling, took 102 wickets. While in England during this time, he played several first-class matches for a Commonwealth XI against an England XI; he scored 20 in 1951 and accumulated 98 and 61 in 1952.

Headley's success for Dudley was watched keenly in Jamaica and commentators began to discuss his availability for the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20West%20Indies%20in%201953%E2%80%9354">1954 series against England</a>. A public subscription to finance his travel to Jamaica, opened by the "Daily Gleaner", raised over £1,000, and despite his reservations, Headley returned to Jamaica. Playing in a fund-raising match, he sustained a hand injury and playing for the Combined Parishes in a minor match against the MCC, a short ball from <a href="Fred%20Trueman">Fred Trueman</a> struck Headley's arm. The latter injury kept him out of the first-class match between Jamaica and the MCC, but he played in the second where, although hampered by his injury, he scored 53 not out. The Test selectors had seen enough to include Headley in the team for the first Test. Reaction among critics was mixed, and Headley, nearing his 45th birthday, remains the oldest man as of 2015 to play a Test match for West Indies. Headley batted at number six, and it appeared that England, under the captaincy of <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>, let Headley score an easy run to begin his innings, which Hutton later confirmed to be the case. However, Headley later argued that the run was given to ensure that he was batting at the beginning of the next over, so that England could try to get him out before he settled down.

Headley scored 16 and 1 in the match, his final Test appearance. He used his experience to influence the captain, Jeff Stollmeyer, advising him not to enforce the follow on and to use <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a> bowling to slow down the tourists' scoring. These tactics helped West Indies to a 140-run win in a match they might have lost; Stollmeyer followed a similar approach in the following match. In 22 Tests, Headley scored 2,190 runs at an average of 60.83.

Headley finished his career at Dudley at the end of 1954; his son Ron played for the club from 1957, having already played for its second team in 1952 as a 13-year-old. After his final Test match appearance, Headley's only other first-class match was in the Commonwealth XI fixture in 1954, when he scored 64 in his final first-class innings. In a career total of 103 first-class games he aggregated 9,921 runs at 69.86, with 33 centuries, and took 51 wickets at 36.11.

Headley is regarded by critics as one of the best batsmen from the Caribbean and one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley described Headley as "the yardstick against whom all other West Indian batsmen are measured". In 1988, "<a href="The%20Cricketer">The Cricketer</a>" magazine placed him in an all-time West Indian team, as did a panel of judges for another such team in July 2010, while in 2004, another panel of experts named him among the top five West Indian players. He was the first world-class batsman from the West Indies who was black, and was given the nicknames "Atlas" and "the Black <a href="Don%20Bradman">Bradman</a>" by commentators; some quipped that Bradman should be called "the White Headley". According to historian Gideon Haigh, his role was made harder by the weakness of his colleagues, as few outstanding players find it easy to play in teams which lose frequently. Although he was a naturally attacking player, Headley felt the need to play cautiously owing to the way his team depended on him. C. L. R. James believed that no other great batsman had to carry such a burden for so long. In the years before the war, Headley scored 25.61% of the runs scored in Tests by West Indies, more than twice as many as the next best batsman, and two-thirds of the team's centuries, scoring ten of the team's first fourteen centuries in Test cricket. Headley usually batted at number three and as the opening batsmen were often dismissed quickly, he frequently began his innings early.

As of 2014, Headley's average in Test matches of 60.83 is third highest among those with 2,000 runs, behind Bradman and <a href="Graeme%20Pollock">Graeme Pollock</a>, and but for the Tests he played after the war, he would have been above Pollock. In all first-class matches, he has the third highest average with 69.86, behind Bradman and <a href="Vijay%20Merchant">Vijay Merchant</a> among those who played 50 innings. He averaged a century every fourth innings in which he batted, second again to Bradman, and did not suffer a poor series in his career before the war.

Manley describes Headley as just under medium height with sloping shoulders. His movements were precise and economical on the cricket field; his cap was usually at a slight angle and his sleeves were buttoned down to the wrist. "Wisden" noted in 1933 that his timing and placement of the ball was perfect. Exceptionally quick on his feet, he watched the ball onto the <a href="cricket%20bat">bat</a> more than any other batsman. According to "Wisden", all his shots were equally good but most notable was his <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">on drive</a> played from the back foot. He hit the ball hard and was very difficult to get out. He faced criticism for playing off the back foot so often, but <a href="R.%20C.%20Robertson-Glasgow">R. C. Robertson-Glasgow</a> believed his <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">square cut, late cut</a>, and <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hook</a> were exceptionally good. Headley was particularly effective on bad batting wickets. C. L. R. James calculated that Headley averaged 39.85 and passed fifty on seven occasions in thirteen innings on difficult wickets. According to James's reckoning, Bradman in similar conditions passed fifty once, and averaged 16.66 in fifteen innings. Headley himself preferred batting when the odds favoured the bowlers as he had to go for his shots and play his natural attacking game. He stated: "On a bad wicket, it was you and the bowler ...no nonsense."

Beyond cricket, Headley's success was regarded as important. Of Headley's meeting with the king of England in 1939, the West Indian writer Frank Birbalsingh said: "That one of us—a black man—could shake the hand of a king introduced possibilities formerly undreamt of in our colonial backwater of racial inferiority, psychological subordination and political powerlessness." Manley notes that Headley rose to success at a time of political awakening in Jamaica, when the black majority of the population were increasingly determined to end the minority rule of landowners and challenge the racism of the time. According to Manley, the middle classes saw in Headley "the reassurance which they needed. He demonstrated black capacity." The white upper classes were proud of his achievements as a West Indian, but Manley writes "it was to the black masses that Headley had the deepest significance ... [He] became the focus for longing of an entire people for proof: proof of their own self-worth, their own capacity. Furthermore, they wanted this proof to be laid at the door of the white man who owned the world which defined their circumstances." Manley sees the title of "Atlas" not just in sporting terms, but in his carrying "the hopes of the black, English-speaking Caribbean man ... He was black excellence personified in a white world and in a white sport."

Following the 1955 cricket season, Headley was invited to become a national coach, a post created by the Jamaican government, which involved working mainly with young people. Headley and his second son travelled back to Jamaica, while the rest of the family remained in England. Headley had a heavy workload, particularly in rural areas; together with his assistant <a href="Dickie%20Fuller">Dickie Fuller</a> his role involved encouraging school children to watch and play cricket, and trying to improve standards and facilities throughout the country. Headley became involved in the selection of teams, taking some of them overseas. At this time, he discovered the future West Indian Test player <a href="Roy%20Gilchrist">Roy Gilchrist</a> and future Jamaican cricketer <a href="Henry%20Sewell%20%28cricketer%29">Henry Sewell</a>. However, critics in the 1960s complained that there were not enough Jamaicans in the Test side and blamed Headley and Fuller, although the government remained supportive of their performance. In 1961, Headley coached for six months in Nigeria and earned praise from the <a href="Nigerian%20Cricket%20Association">Nigerian Cricket Association</a>. His official coaching role in Jamaica ended after a new government withdrew funding for coaching in 1962.

Headley married Rena Saunders in 1939. He had nine children in total, including <a href="Ron%20Headley">Ron Headley</a> who was born two days after the end of the Lord's Test of 1939. Ron Headley went on to play professional cricket for the English counties <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a> and Derbyshire, and represented Jamaica before playing two Tests for West Indies in 1973. Another son, <a href="Lynn%20Headley">Lynn</a>, reached the semi-finals of the <a href="100%20metres">100 metres</a> and came fourth in the 100 metres relay at the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Olympics</a>; he also won a gold medal with Jamaican sprint relay teams in the <a href="Central%20American%20and%20Caribbean%20Games">Central American and Caribbean Games</a> of 1966 and silver with the relay team at the <a href="Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a> of the same year. Ron's son <a href="Dean%20Headley">Dean</a>, Headley's grandson, played Test cricket for England; the family thus became the first to have three generations play Test cricket.

After his retirement from coaching, Headley remained associated with cricket, presenting awards and playing in friendly matches. He was the official representative of the Jamaican Cricket Board at Constantine's funeral in 1971. Official recognition came Headley's way when he was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">M.B.E.</a> in 1956 and was made an honorary life member of the MCC in 1958. In 1969, a bronze sculpture of his head was unveiled in Jamaica's National Stadium, and in 1973 the Norman Manley Foundation gave him the Award for Excellence in Sports. In the latter year, he also received the <a href="Order%20of%20Distinction">Order of Distinction</a>. He died in Kingston on 30 November 1983.

Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)

Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877 – 12 October 1936) was an English <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er best known for inventing the <a href="googly">googly</a>, a <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">delivery</a> designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, it appears to be a <a href="leg%20break">leg break</a>, but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to that which is expected, behaving as an <a href="off%20break">off break</a> instead. Bosanquet, who played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> as an <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>. He was chosen as a <a href="Wisden%20Cricketer%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketer of the Year</a> in 1905.

Bosanquet played cricket for <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> from 1891 to 1896, before gaining his <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a> at <a href="Oriel%20College%2C%20Oxford">Oriel College, Oxford</a>. He was a moderately successful batsman who bowled at <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">fast-medium pace</a> for <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a> between 1898 and 1900. As a student, he made several appearances for Middlesex and achieved a regular place in the county side as an <a href="Amateur%20and%20professional%20cricketers%23Amateurism%20in%20cricket">amateur</a>. While playing a tabletop game, Bosanquet devised a new technique for delivering a ball, later named the "googly", which he practised during his time at Oxford. He first used it in cricket matches around 1900, abandoning his faster style of bowling, but it was not until 1903, when he had a successful season with the ball, that his new delivery began to attract attention. Having gone on several minor overseas tours, Bosanquet was selected in 1903–04 for the fully representative <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) tour of Australia. During that tour, he made his Test debut for England and although he largely failed as a batsman, he performed well as a bowler and troubled all the opposing batsmen with his googly.

More success followed; in the 1904 season, he took more than 100 <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a> and his bowling career peaked when took eight wickets for 107 runs in the first Test against Australia in 1905 to bowl England to victory. However, he never mastered control of <a href="Good%20length%20ball">good length bowling</a> and remained an erratic performer. After 1905, Bosanquet's bowling went into decline; he practically gave it up and made fewer first-class appearances owing to his business interests. After taking part in the First World War in the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>, he married and had a son, <a href="Reginald%20Bosanquet">Reginald Bosanquet</a>, who later became a television newsreader. He died in 1936, aged 58.

Bosanquet was born in <a href="Bulls%20Cross">Bulls Cross</a>, <a href="Enfield%20Town">Enfield</a>, Middlesex, on 13 October 1877. He was one of five children of Bernard Tindal Bosanquet and his wife Eva Maude Cotton; Bosanquet had a younger brother and three sisters. Many of his relations were well known in their fields, including his uncle and namesake <a href="Bernard%20Bosanquet%20%28philosopher%29">Bernard Bosanquet</a> the philosopher. His grandfather, <a href="James%20Whatman%20Bosanquet">James Whatman Bosanquet</a>, was a banker and achieved distinction as a biblical historian. His father worked for the banking firm Bosanquet & Co., and became a partner in a firm of hide, leather, and fur brokers in London; he was also <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Middlesex">High Sheriff of Middlesex</a> from 1897 to 1898 and captained Enfield cricket club. His great grandfather, <a href="Nicholas%20Conyngham%20Tindal">Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal</a> was <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20Common%20Pleas">Chief Justice of the Common Pleas</a> between 1829 and 1846.

After going to Sunnymede School in Slough, Bosanquet attended <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> between 1891 and 1896. While at Eton, he received cricket coaching from the <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> professionals <a href="Maurice%20Read">Maurice Read</a> and <a href="Bill%20Brockwell">Bill Brockwell</a>. They improved his play to the point where he played for the cricket first eleven in 1896. Against <a href="Winchester%20College">Winchester College</a>, he took three wickets and scored 29 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> in the second innings, while at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a> against <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow School</a>, Bosanquet scored 120 runs in 140 minutes. At this time, he bowled <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">fast-medium pace</a>, while as a batsman he had developed, in the words of his obituary in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", "a rather curious, wristless style; stiff and yet powerful".

In 1897, Bosanquet went to <a href="Oriel%20College%2C%20Oxford">Oriel College, Oxford</a>, and although he left in 1900 without completing a degree, he recorded many sporting accomplishments. Making his first-class debut in 1898 for <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a> against a team selected by <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> captain A. J. Webbe, he had little batting success during the season, having a top score of 17 runs. He was more productive with the ball, twice taking <a href="Five%20wicket%20haul%23F">five wickets in an innings</a> for Oxford, and was awarded his cricket <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a>. Selected for the <a href="The%20University%20Match%20%28cricket%29">University Match</a>, he made 54 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>, his highest score of the season. He later made two appearances for Middlesex, but did not distinguish himself, scoring 17 runs and taking no wickets. In all first-class matches in 1898, Bosanquet scored 168 runs at a <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">batting average</a> of 14.00 and took 30 wickets at a <a href="bowling%20average">bowling average</a> of 18.70. At the end of the season, he joined a team led by <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Plum Warner</a> which toured America, where he had further success as a bowler.

Bosanquet improved his record for Oxford in 1899, scoring two fifties and taking five wickets on three occasions before the University match. Against Cambridge, he failed with the bat but took seven wickets for 89 runs in the first innings. Bosanquet's record earned him selection for <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">the Gentlemen against the Players</a>; in this prestigious match he took only one wicket but scored 61 runs. He played another two matches for Middlesex and ended the season with a batting record of 419 runs in all matches, at an average of 27.93, and 55 wickets at 22.72. He played some end of season non-first-class matches for <a href="I%20Zingari">I Zingari</a>, taking 16 wickets in a game against <a href="Ireland%20national%20cricket%20team">Ireland</a>, and went on another tour of America, led by <a href="K.%20S.%20Ranjitsinhji">K. S. Ranjitsinhji</a>.

Bosanquet's final season for Oxford was his best statistically. He scored his maiden first-class century against <a href="London%20County%20Cricket%20Club">London County</a> and, against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>, he recorded what were to be the best bowling figures of his career, taking nine for 31 in the second innings and a total of 15 wickets in the game for 65 runs. His final match for Oxford was the 1900 University match, in which he scored 42 and 23. For the remainder of the season, Bosanquet re-joined Middlesex, and in his second match, against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>, achieved the rare distinction of a century in each <a href="innings">innings</a>: 136 in 110 minutes in the first innings, followed by 139 in 170 minutes in the second. He scored three further fifties for Middlesex and once took five wickets in an innings, but bowled comparatively rarely, only once bowling more than 13 <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> in an innings. In all first-class matches in the season, Bosanquet scored 1,026 runs at 34.20 and took 50 wickets at 23.20.

In all his matches for Oxford, Bosanquet scored 801 runs at an average of 25.03 and took 112 wickets at an average of 19.49. In other sports, he received <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">half-Blues</a> for <a href="Hammer%20throw">hammer-throwing</a> and <a href="Cue%20sports">billiards</a>, and also played <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a>.

Bosanquet is remembered as the inventor of the <a href="googly">googly</a>, a delivery designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, it appears to be a <a href="leg%20break">leg break</a>, but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to that expected, behaving as an <a href="off%20break">off break</a> instead. However, Bosanquet was a pace bowler in his university days. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" described his bowling from this period as "very useful ... but that was all, and had he kept to his original style real distinction at cricket would only have come to him through his batting". Furthermore, he disliked bowling quickly, believing he was destined only to be used as a last resort and that he would have little success as a fast bowler. Consequently, Bosanquet decided to change his style. According to his own account, his inspiration came in the mid-1890s, from a table-top game he often played called Twisti-Twosti; the object was to bounce a tennis ball on a table so that it could not be caught by an opposing player. Bosanquet began to experiment with ways of throwing the ball so that, after pitching, it turned and spun in an unexpected direction, without his opponent detecting any difference in the delivery. Finding he could do this successfully, he began to practise using the same method to bowl in a form of soft-ball cricket and then in the <a href="cricket%20nets">cricket nets</a> with a hard ball, but did not at the time take his discovery seriously. It was not until 1899 or 1900 that Bosanquet began to practise in earnest, and developed an orthodox leg break in the nets to complement his new style of delivery, which spun in the same direction as an off break. During the lunch breaks in Oxford matches, he would often bowl to the best opposing batsmen in the nets, delivering several leg breaks, followed by an off break, without changing his bowling action; the ball would sometimes hit the bemused batsman on the knee, to the amusement of spectators. A slightly different version of events was provided by the son of Louise Bosanquet, Bernard's cousin, who claimed in 1965 that Bosanquet conceived the idea in 1890 and practised bowling to Louise with a tennis ball from 1893 onwards. There were later suggestions that other cricketers invented the googly before Bosanquet. In 1935, <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> wrote that <a href="Kingsmill%20Key">Kingsmill Key</a>, a former captain of Surrey, told him that the googly was invented by an Oxford student, <a href="Herbert%20Page">Herbert Page</a>, in the 1880s. Key claimed that Page bowled the delivery regularly, but never used it in a first-class match.

Practising throughout 1899 and 1900, Bosanquet began to use the googly in minor matches before using it in important cricket. His first use of the new delivery in first-class cricket came in the match against Leicestershire in 1900 in which he scored two centuries. In the second innings, <a href="Samuel%20Coe">Samuel Coe</a> had scored 98 when Bosanquet, still known as a fast-bowler, bowled his off break; the ball bounced four times and the batsman was <a href="stumped">stumped</a> (although, writing in 1925, Bosanquet recalled Coe had been <a href="bowled">bowled</a>). Bosanquet later wrote that the wicket "was rightly treated as a joke, and was the subject of ribald comment". Middlesex captains permitted him to try googlies if there was little pressure on, but he later wrote: "Though I could claim some five or six wickets before the close of the season, my efforts produced far more laughter than dismay in the hearts of opposing batsmen". But Bosanquet persisted with the delivery and soon began to be noticed by influential cricketers who recognised the potential of the googly. Previously, some bowlers occasionally bowled unintended googlies, but were unable to control them. Although batsmen were accustomed to off break or leg break bowlers, it was an unprecedented problem to face a bowler who could bowl both types of delivery at will, disguising which one he bowled. Bosanquet persuaded teammates to remain silent as he wished to maintain the impression that his off break was an accident so that batsmen were not expecting it. He further tried to play down his successes: he feigned surprise, acting as if they were similarly accidental.

It was around 1903 that Bosanquet's delivery first became known as a "googly". Pelham Warner claimed that the first use of the word was in the "Lyttelton Times", a newspaper based in <a href="Canterbury%20Region">Canterbury</a>, New Zealand, during a 1902–03 tour, but subsequent research has failed to find it. Some have suggested a <a href="M%C4%81ori%20language">Maori</a> origin for the word, although other explanations include a derivation from "guile" meaning cunning, or from the word "googler", meaning a high, flighted delivery at the time.

Apart from some early season games for MCC and A. J. Webbe's XI, all of Bosanquet's cricket in 1901 was for Middlesex. He maintained his faster style of bowling but also began to bowl slow leg breaks, with the as-yet unrecognised googly mixed in as variation. Later, he found he could not effectively maintain both styles and decided to concentrate on spin, gradually dropping his quick bowling. His bowling brought him 36 wickets at an average of 37.52 in 1901 but did not take more than three wickets in a single innings. With the bat, it took until July for him to pass fifty runs in an innings but his form improved in August with four fifties. He ended the season with consecutive centuries against Surrey and <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>. In total, Bosanquet scored 1,240 runs at an average of 32.63, and Warner regarded him as one of the three most reliable batsmen in the Middlesex side. After the season, Bosanquet went on his third tour of America, captaining a team himself. From January to April 1902, he toured the West Indies with <a href="Richard%20Bennett%20%28English%20cricketer%29">Richard Bennett's</a> team. He scored 623 runs at an average of 34.61 with five fifties and 55 wickets at an average of 15.47, including figures of eight for 30 in one innings. Bosanquet's cricket followed a similar pattern in 1902. He scored 749 runs at an average of 24.96, with a century against Cambridge. However, he did not pass fifty after the end of May until his last game of the season. With the ball, he took 40 wickets at an average of 21.17. These included 10 wickets against Oxford and 10 against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>; the latter performance, when he took seven for 57 in the second innings was described as remarkable by "Wisden". It was the first time that his new bowling style attracted attention, although Bosanquet himself tried to play down the success for fear of alerting batsmen to his googly.

In the winter of 1902–03, Bosanquet took part in another tour, this time with <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke's</a> team which <a href="Lord%20Hawke%27s%20XI%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand%20in%201902%E2%80%9303">played matches in New Zealand and Australia</a> and was captained by Warner. In New Zealand, he played two matches against a New Zealand representative side, and in all matches scored 148 runs at an average of 18.50 with one fifty, an innings of 82 against South Island. Bosanquet also took 18 wickets at an average of 22.61; his style of bowling attracted a great deal of attention. In one game, <a href="Charles%20Bannerman">Charles Bannerman</a>, who played in Australia's first Test match in 1877, was umpire. He told Warner: "When the next team goes to Australia, be sure that Mr Bosanquet is in it. He bowls a lot of bad 'uns; but that ball of his that breaks the wrong way will be very useful on the hard Australian wickets." However, the tour was more notable for an incident in the match against <a href="Canterbury%20Wizards">Canterbury</a>. Bosanquet had taken an early wicket in the first innings, but bowled poorly afterwards. He was the fourth bowler used in the second innings and with his third ball, it looked as if he had bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29">non-striker</a> <a href="Arthur%20Sims">Arthur Sims</a>, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket-keeper, <a href="Arthur%20Whatman">Arthur Whatman</a>, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: "You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. Anybody could see that." Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. Bosanquet later bowled Sims and Canterbury were easily defeated. However, the incident continued to attract attention. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to forget about it, but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games.

The tour moved to Australia and Bosanquet scored fifties against the three states which Hawke's team played, accumulating 168 runs at an average of 33.60. As a bowler, he took eight wickets at 42.75. His best bowling performance was to take six for 153 out of a <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> total of 463. This included the wicket of <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>, the leading Australian batsman and one of the best in the world at the time. Bosanquet delivered two conventional leg breaks followed by a googly, later described by Bosanquet as the first bowled in Australia, which bowled Trumper. Many critics were impressed by the wicket-taking potential of googly bowling on hard pitches and Warner later described Bosanquet's bowling as causing a sensation.

In the English 1903 season, Bosanquet's batting record improved. He scored a century against Oxford in the second match of the season, followed by six for 31 in Oxford's second innings. He went on to score nine fifties, including three in successive innings, in an aggregate of 1,082 runs at an average of 34.90. With the ball, he recorded his best wicket haul in a season, taking 63 wickets at an average of 21.00. While this was not seen as a particularly impressive record, "Wisden" noted that "the batsmen who played against him came to the conclusion that he had immense possibilities." Critics recognised that Bosanquet had developed a new style of bowling. While he could not always control the place the ball would land, making him erratic, several cricketers including Warner believed if he could gain more control, he would become one of the best bowlers in the world. Although his bowling was still developing, and he was still trying to perfect bowling an ordinary leg break as well as master the googly, he took six wickets in consecutive innings against Surrey and <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>, going on to take 10 wickets in the latter match. He also took 12 wickets in a match for Warner's team against a touring side, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. Bosanquet's contributions helped Middlesex to win the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> for the first time. Although no Test matches were played that season, Warner believed that Bosanquet's form would have gained him a place in a representative side. For the first time since 1899, he was selected for the Gentlemen against the Players, although he was unsuccessful.

Bosanquet's performances during the season earned him a place on Warner's team for the first tour of Australia by the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC), which was to include <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a>. Warner later wrote that he was accused of selecting Bosanquet out of favouritism as they played on the same county team, and received "a hail of criticism and disapprobation" as a result. Before the tour began, Sussex and England batsman <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a> wrote an open letter to Warner in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", stating Warner "must persuade that Bosanquet of yours to practise, practise, practise those funny 'googlies' of his till he is automatically certain of his length. That leg-break of his which breaks from the off might win a test match!"

Bosanquet was one of the few bowlers in the MCC team not to have some success in the opening two matches of the tour, although he impressed Warner. In addition, he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game. The third match of the tour was against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>; Bosanquet took four for 60, and his googly caused many problems, particularly for Australia's opening batsman <a href="Reggie%20Duff">Reggie Duff</a>. He continuously defeated the batsmen, maintaining his length effectively through the innings. By this stage of the tour, Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler in a strong attack if he could bowl a good length, particularly on hard, fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen. However, Bosnaquet's bowling form remained erratic; in a minor match against a weak side, the opposing captain made a joke about his team's bowling being no worse than Bosanquet's.

Bosanquet played in the first Test against Australia, making his Test debut for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>. Australia batted first and recovered from a poor start to score 285 runs; Bosanquet took the wickets of <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a> and <a href="Syd%20Gregory">Syd Gregory</a> with googlies to finish with two for 52 in 13 <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a>. He scored a single run when he batted, out of an English total of 577. In the second innings he bowled 23 overs and took one for 100. The English bowlers came under heavy punishment from the Australian batsmen; <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> scored an unbeaten 185 and the team reached 485. Bosanquet had <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> stumped, and Warner later wrote that he was in good form with the ball, beating Trumper with a googly and troubling others. England needed to score 194 to win and Bosanquet came to the wicket with 13 needed to win; he scored one run before the winning hit was made. A hand injury forced Bosanquet to miss the second Test. However, with England 2–0 up in the series, he returned for the third Test. On a very good pitch for batting, Bosanquet took three for 95 in an Australian innings of 388, and none of the batsmen were comfortable batting against his googly. When England replied, Bosanquet was out for 10 runs, hitting a poor shot as his team were bowled out for 245. In Australia's second innings, Bosanquet bowled badly at first, delivering <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a>es and <a href="long%20hop">long hop</a>s at the end of the third day's play. Next morning, his bowling improved as he established a good length, delivering a spell of seven overs in which he took four wickets for 23 runs, again causing confusion with his googly. He finished the innings with figures of four for 73. However, he failed again with the bat, scoring 10 runs in his second innings as England fell to a heavy defeat.
There followed a break in the series of almost a month as the MCC team played more state teams. In the match against <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a>, Bosanquet scored 35 and an unbeaten 124 which included eighteen fours and five hits over the boundary. However, his bowling was poor; Warner wrote that Bosanquet "bowled abominably". Against New South Wales, a team the tourists regarded as the biggest challenge outside of the Test matches, Bosnanquet was very successful. In the first innings, he scored 54 runs in 65 minutes, then took two for 51 with the ball. When the MCC batted again, he played an innings which Warner called the best of his career. Unbeaten on 17 at the start of the third day, Bosanquet scored 97 runs in 65 minutes before being dismissed for 114. Bosanquet followed this with figures of six for 45, including two wickets bowled by the googly.

The fourth Test proved to be the crucial game of the series. England scored 249, of which Bosanquet made 12 before falling to the final ball of the first day, and Australia replied with 131. Bosanquet was required to bowl only two overs. He failed again in the second innings, scoring seven but England reached 210. Australia required 329 to win, which was considered possible on a good pitch; Warner recorded that Australia's batsmen believed their team to be favourites. Bosanquet came on to bowl shortly before the tea interval and immediately took the wickets of <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a> and Syd Gregory. He went on to take another four wickets, at one point having taken five wickets for 12 runs, to complete figures of six for 51. England won by 157 runs to ensure they could not lose the series, being 3–1 up with one game remaining. Australia recorded a consolation victory in favourable conditions for the bowlers in the final Test, and Bosanquet scored 20 runs in the match and bowled four overs without taking a wicket. In the final match of the tour, Bosanquet scored 22 and took three for 70 in the first innings, one wicket coming when the batsman gave a catch to the wicketkeeper from a wide ball which bounced three times.

In all first-class matches on the tour, Bosanquet scored 587 runs at an average of 36.68 and took 37 wickets at an average of 27.27. In Test matches, he took 16 wickets at an average of 25.18 and scored 62 runs at an average of 8.85 with a top-score of 16. Following the team's return home, Bosanquet wrote an article giving his impressions of the tour for "Wisden". The main "Wisden" report stated: "Bosanquet's value with the ball cannot be judged from the averages, as on his bad days he is, as everyone knows, one of the most expensive of living bowlers. When he was in form the Australians thought him far more difficult on hard wickets than any of the other bowlers, Clement Hill saying, without any qualification, that his presence in the eleven won the rubber."

The reaction of crowds in Australia was slightly different. According to Justin Parkinson, in his book on the history of English legspin, they took to "calling Bosanquet 'Elsie', a tribute to the elaborate, supposedly effeminate jumpers he wore." They also named the googly delivery a "Bosie". However, this may have been more than a simple shortening of his name. According to Parkinson, it may have referred to the nickname ("Bosey") of <a href="Lord%20Alfred%20Douglas">Lord Alfred Douglas</a> who was widely known to have had a homosexual affair, a criminal act at the time, with <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>. This remained a topical subject, and the source of humour, in Australia. Parkinson suggests that the anonymous originator of the name "Bosie" for the googly must have been aware of the association. He also notes that the other common term in Australia for the googly was "wrong 'un", which was slang for both "criminal" and "homosexual". Parkinson suggests that these two terms for the googly, the nickname "Elsie", were attempts to "label the whole English ruling class as effete".

The 1904 season was Bosanquet's best with bat and ball. Although he made a slow start batting, failing to reach double figures in six of his first nine innings, he was immediately successful with the ball. He took nine for 107 for MCC against the touring South African team and seven for 83 for I Zingari against Gentlemen of England, going on to take 11 wickets in the latter match. Then for Middlesex, he scored 110 in 85 minutes with 16 fours, in a <a href="Tie%20%28cricket%29">tied</a> match against the South Africans, and 126 in two hours against Surrey including a five and 16 fours. In the latter match he also took five for 139. This preceded his selection for two Gentlemen v Players matches in six days. In the first at Lord's, he scored nine and 22 and took four wickets in the match. At the Oval, he hit 145 in 210 minutes with two fives and 15 fours. After taking two for 97 in the Players' first innings, he took six for 60 in the second to give the Gentlemen their second victory in a week. In a loss to <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, the eventual 1904 County Championship winners, Bosanquet took six for 99 for Middlesex and in a drawn game against Yorkshire, who finished second in the table, he scored 141 and took 10 for 248. Immediately following the Yorkshire game, Bosanquet took 12 for 240 in a defeat of Nottinghamshire. After a quiet time in the return game against Lancashire, Bosanquet had a run of three consecutive successful matches. In the first, he took six for 75 against Surrey. In a close victory over Kent, he took five for 23 and eight wickets in the match after scoring 80 runs, and he achieved figures of 14 for 190 in a win against Sussex. In an end of season festival game, Bosanquet took five for 89 for the South against the North. In all first-class matches, Bosanquet achieved the <a href="Double%20%28cricket%29">double</a> of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets: he scored 1,405 runs at an average of 36.02 and took 132 wickets at an average of 21.62, the only time in his career he passed 100 wickets in a season. He accumulated five fifties and four centuries; with the ball he took 10 or more wickets in four matches and had 14 five wicket hauls.

His performance in 1904 earned him selection as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>; the citation noted he was more likely that any other bowler to dismiss a strong side on a good batting wicket, and no batsmen had deciphered how he bowled the googly. However, it also remarked that "he sends down more bad balls than any other front rank bowler."

The Australians toured England in 1905, but Bosanquet played only three games before the first Test. He scored 93 against Nottinghamshire, while against Sussex, he scored centuries in each innings for the second time in his career. His first innings century took 105 minutes and his second took 75 minutes. He also took eight for 53 in the second innings to bowl Middlesex to victory and give him 11 wickets in the game. He became the first player in first-class cricket to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in the same match; only two further players have since achieved the feat, as of 2015. Bosanquet was selected for the opening Test match, his first such appearance in England. In England's first innings, he assisted in a recovery, making his highest Test score of 27. Australia took a first innings lead, but despite a failure by Bosanquet, England scored 426 for five <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> in their second innings. Australia were set 402 to win, which was considered unlikely in the time available so the tourists had to bat until the end of the game to achieve a draw. The pitch remained good for batting and Australia reached 62 without losing a wicket. Subsequently, Bosanquet took five quick wickets, including a good catch from his own bowling to dismiss Hill, to reduce Australia to 100 for five. Although the tourists managed a partial recovery, Bosanquet continued to take wickets. With very little time remaining owing to poor light—if play had stopped, Australia would have achieved a draw—he took the last wicket to fall, giving England a 213-run victory. Bosanquet had taken his best Test figures of eight for 107. "Wisden" reported: "The Englishmen owed everything to Bosanquet ... He gained nothing from the condition of the ground, the pitch remaining firm and true to the end."

After two county matches in which he did little with bat or ball, Bosanquet played in the second Test. However, in his two innings, he scored only six and four not out, and did not bowl in the only innings. After taking 11 wickets for Middlesex against Kent in the only match he played between the Tests, in the third match of the series, Bosanquet scored 20 and 22 not out and took one wicket in the match. This was his final appearance of the series as he was dropped for the final two Tests. "Wisden" reported that "Bosanquet was a complete disappointment". The almanack also commented in the report on the first Test: "In the first flush of his triumph his place in the England team seemed secure for the whole season, but he never reproduced his form, and dropped out of the eleven after the match at Leeds." This was his final Test. In seven matches for England he scored 147 runs at an average of 13.36 and took 25 wickets at 24.16.

In the remainder of the season, Bosanquet never took more than three wickets in an innings, although he scored a century against Essex and three other fifties. He played for the Gentlemen against the Players scoring 38 and 19 but did not take a wicket in the 17 overs he bowled. In 20 first-class matches, Bosanquet scored 1,198 runs (average 37.43) and took 63 wickets (average 27.77). After this season, he rarely bowled and later stated that he did not bowl the googly after 1905, particularly after one embarrassing attempt to do so in a match at Harrow. In another eight seasons of first-class cricket, he took only 22 wickets. However, his batting seemed to improve in this time.

After 1905, Bosanquet played fewer first-class matches owing to his business career, and appeared as a batsman rather than an all-rounder. He played rarely for Middlesex, but usually seemed to make runs despite his lack of practice. He played four matches in 1906. He scored 87 and 101 for Middlesex against Somerset in his first game and took five for 51 against Yorkshire in his second. His good form continued in his third match for Middlesex as he scored two fifties against Essex and he was chosen for the Gentlemen against the Players. Although he did not bowl in that match, he scored 56 in the first innings. In total, he scored 415 runs at 51.87 and took eight wickets at 46.00. The following season, he played six matches for Middlesex, took two wickets and scored 358 runs at 35.00 with three fifties. Bosanquet played more often in 1908. He made 1,081 runs at an average of 54.05, topping the first-class batting averages. He scored centuries for Middlesex against Somerset and Lancashire in addition to five fifties. He represented the Gentlemen v Players twice—at Lord's and in an end of season festival game—without reaching fifty. However, in two other festival games in September, Bosanquet scored a fifty for the South against the North and scored 214, the highest score of his career, for the Rest of England against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In the season, he also took 12 wickets at an average of 29.00, although only bowling more than 10 overs in an innings three times, the final wickets of his career.

Bosanquet did not appear in first-class cricket again until 1911 when he played two matches in the <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough Festival</a> at the end of the season. During the first game, he scored a century in 75 minutes for the Gentlemen against the Players, who had an attack including <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a>. In 1912, he played for Middlesex against the Australians but did not bat or bowl, before appearing in three festival games in August and September. He played twice in 1913, hitting two fifties for L. Robinson's XI against Cambridge University and scoring a third fifty in a match at the end of the season, while in 1914 he appeared for Middlesex against Hampshire in <a href="Frank%20Tarrant">Frank Tarrant</a>’s benefit match and for L. Robinson's XI against Oxford University. After the First World War, Bosanquet made seven appearances in the 1919 season, six of them for Middlesex, scoring three fifties in an aggregate of 335 runs (average 27.91). He did not appear again in first-class cricket. He ended his career with 11,696 runs at an average of 33.41 with 21 centuries. With the ball, he took 629 wickets at an average of 23.80. He continued to be successful in a good class of club cricket and in matches at country houses. His son later recalled how he "drifted from one country-house party to the next, tipping the butler on Monday morning, before travelling to his next social-cum-sporting invitation."

After he became a leg break bowler, Bosanquet bowled the ball very slowly and did not look dangerous. However, while still appearing to bowl a leg break, he could deliver an off break which confused the best batsmen in the world and this googly was recognised as a completely new style of delivery. He achieved this through dropping his wrist before releasing the ball. The unfamiliarity of this type of bowling increased his effectiveness on the occasions when he could bowl a good length. But he was never a reliable bowler; on other occasions, he bowled long hops and full tosses giving away easy runs. Warner noted that Bosanquet had been "described as the 'worst best bowler' in the world".

Bosanquet did not bat in a style typical of a cricketer from Eton, where batsmen were taught to play with style and grace. Warner described him as "decidedly stiff and awkward looking ... He does not seem to play the ball in a free, unconstrained way, but rather stabs at it and gives one the impression of making his stroke at the very last moment." In Australia, Bosanquet was troubled by fast pitches and struggled against bowlers such as <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> and <a href="Bert%20Hopkins">Bert Hopkins</a> who could make the ball move towards him through the air. Nevertheless, he displayed great confidence in his ability and on a pitch which assisted spinners, he could flick the ball onto the leg side very effectively. He could hit the ball hard, particularly when <a href="Drive%20%28cricket%29">driving</a>. "The Times" said: "He had a wonderful eye and great strength of fore-arm and anything short he could hit very hard."

In the First World War, Bosanquet was a lieutenant in the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>. On 5 April 1924, he married Mary Janet Kennedy-Jones, the daughter of a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28UK%29">Member of Parliament</a>. They had one child, <a href="Reginald%20Bosanquet">Reginald</a>, who later achieved fame as a television newsreader. When his father died, Bosanquet sold the family home in Middlesex and moved to Wykehurst Farm, Surrey, where he died on 12 October 1936. He left an estate valued at £2,276 0s. 4d.

As the googly caused a sensation following its invention, many other cricketers tried to emulate Bosanquet. <a href="Reggie%20Schwarz">Reggie Schwarz</a>, the South African cricketer who played for Middlesex, learned how to bowl the googly through observation of Bosanquet; Schwarz in turn passed it on to the South African bowlers <a href="Aubrey%20Faulkner">Aubrey Faulkner</a>, <a href="Bert%20Vogler">Bert Vogler</a> and <a href="Gordon%20White%20%28cricketer%29">Gordon White</a>. These four raised the bowling of the googly to a high standard and raised fears of the detrimental effect it would have on batting. Following the development of googly bowling by South Africans, it was further refined by English and Australian cricketers until it became firmly established. In later years, the googly was blamed for a deterioration in the quality and attractiveness of batting. Bosanquet refused to accept any blame and published a defence in "<a href="The%20Morning%20Post">The Morning Post</a>" during 1924, later reprinted in "Wisden", which humorously downplayed the impact of the googly. He wrote: "It is not for me to defend it. Other and more capable hands have taken it up and exploited it, and, if blame is to be allotted, let it be on their shoulders. For me is the task of the historian, and if I appear too much in the role of the proud parent, I ask forgiveness."

Until the invention of the googly, bowling was expected to be predictable, and the googly may initially have been considered an underhand tactic. On one occasion, Nottinghamshire batsman <a href="William%20Gunn%20%28cricketer%29">William Gunn</a> was stumped after running down the pitch in an attempt to stop a ball bowled by Bosanquet. Gunn's teammate <a href="Arthur%20Shrewsbury">Arthur Shrewsbury</a> then protested that Bosanquet's bowling was unfair. On another occasion, when asked if the googly was illegal, Bosanquet is said to have replied, "Oh no, only immoral." For many years, the googly remained known as a "Bosie" in Australia. His "Times" obituary stated, "No man probably has in his time had so important and lasting an influence on the game of cricket".

Give Peace a Chance (Grey's Anatomy)

"Give Peace a Chance" is the seventh episode of the <a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy%20%28season%206%29">sixth season</a> of the American television <a href="medical%20drama">medical drama</a> "<a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a>", and the show's 109th episode overall. Written by <a href="Peter%20Nowalk">Peter Nowalk</a> and directed by <a href="Chandra%20Wilson">Chandra Wilson</a>, the episode was originally broadcast on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC) in the United States on October 29, 2009. "Grey's Anatomy" centers on a group of young doctors in training. In this episode, <a href="Dr.%20Derek%20Shepherd">Dr. Derek Shepherd</a> (<a href="Patrick%20Dempsey">Patrick Dempsey</a>) performs an operation on a hospital technician's "inoperable" tumor, despite the objections of the chief of surgery, <a href="Dr.%20Richard%20Webber">Dr. Richard Webber</a> (<a href="James%20Pickens%2C%20Jr.">James Pickens, Jr.</a>).

The episode was designed to revolve around Dempsey's character. <a href="Katherine%20Heigl">Katherine Heigl</a> (<a href="Dr.%20Izzie%20Stevens">Dr. Izzie Stevens</a>) was absent from the episode, as she was filming the 2010 blockbuster "<a href="Life%20as%20We%20Know%20It%20%28film%29">Life as We Know It</a>". <a href="Mark%20Saul%20%28actor%29">Mark Saul</a>, <a href="Jesse%20Williams%20%28actor%29">Jesse Williams</a>, and <a href="Nora%20Zehetner">Nora Zehetner</a> returned as guest stars, while <a href="Faran%20Tahir">Faran Tahir</a> made his only appearance. "Give Peace a Chance" won Wilson an <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award">NAACP Image Award</a>, and was generally well received among critics, with Tahir's character particularly praised. The initial episode broadcast was ranked #4 for the night with 13.74 million viewers, and a 5.2/13 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings/share%20and%20total%20viewers">Nielsen rating/share</a> in the 18–49 demographic.

"Give Peace a Chance" opens with Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's chief of surgery, <a href="Dr.%20Richard%20Webber">Dr. Richard Webber</a> (<a href="James%20Pickens%2C%20Jr.">James Pickens, Jr.</a>) implementing a new computerized surgical scheduling system, which is disliked by many of the hospital's staff. Thereafter, Isaac (<a href="Faran%20Tahir">Faran Tahir</a>), a hospital lab technician, brings <a href="Dr.%20Derek%20Shepherd">Dr. Derek Shepherd</a> (<a href="Patrick%20Dempsey">Patrick Dempsey</a>) a scan of his tumor, which has been declared inoperable by several other physicians due to its complexity. Isaac asks Shepherd to remove it. Shepherd agrees, but Webber refuses permission for the procedure because of the high risk involved. Shepherd ignores the chief's directions and schedules the surgery. The interns and residents all want the chance to assist due to the rarity of such a tumor, so Shepherd hosts a competition in which the winner gets to join him in the operating room. After seeing Dr. Steve Mostow (<a href="Mark%20Saul%20%28actor%29">Mark Saul</a>) make a mistake, <a href="Dr.%20Cristina%20Yang">Dr. Cristina Yang</a> (<a href="Sandra%20Oh">Sandra Oh</a>) is confident that she will win the competition, but loses to <a href="Jackson%20Avery">Dr. Jackson Avery</a> (<a href="Jesse%20Williams%20%28actor%29">Jesse Williams</a>). <a href="Dr.%20Lexie%20Grey">Dr. Lexie Grey</a> (<a href="Chyler%20Leigh">Chyler Leigh</a>) is not invited to compete because Shepherd wants her to be his caregiver in what would be a long surgery. Knowing that she will not be able to use the bathroom for the entire procedure, Lexie decides to wear a diaper into the operating room; her courage and dedication impresses Yang.

<a href="Dr.%20Izzie%20Stevens">Dr. Izzie Stevens</a> (<a href="Katherine%20Heigl">Katherine Heigl</a>) is scheduled for an <a href="interleukin%202">interleukin 2</a> (IL-2) treatment but is absent from the hospital. <a href="Dr.%20Alex%20Karev">Dr. Alex Karev</a> (<a href="Justin%20Chambers">Justin Chambers</a>) calls her, but she does not answer or come, so Karev cries to fellow <a href="Residency%20%28medicine%29">resident</a> Dr. Reed Adamson (<a href="Nora%20Zehetner">Nora Zehetner</a>). Shepherd spends ten hours in the operating room contemplating what to do about the tumor, with the motivational support of fellow surgeons <a href="Mark%20Sloan%20%28Grey%27s%20Anatomy%29">Dr. Mark Sloan</a> (<a href="Eric%20Dane">Eric Dane</a>), <a href="Dr.%20Miranda%20Bailey">Dr. Miranda Bailey</a> (<a href="Chandra%20Wilson">Chandra Wilson</a>), and <a href="Dr.%20Callie%20Torres">Dr. Callie Torres</a> (<a href="Sara%20Ramirez">Sara Ramirez</a>). Webber orders Shepherd to end the surgery because he is wasting hospital resources. Shortly thereafter, Isaac awakens to Shepherd explaining that the surgery would not have been possible without paralyzing him. Isaac convinces Shepherd to operate again in secret the next day, and the latter maps out a diagram of the surgery on his bedroom wall while discussing it with his wife <a href="Dr.%20Meredith%20Grey">Dr. Meredith Grey</a> (<a href="Ellen%20Pompeo">Ellen Pompeo</a>), who is home on bed rest after donating part of her liver to her father in the episode "<a href="Tainted%20Obligation">Tainted Obligation</a>". Backed by his fellow attendings, Shepherd obtains Webber's permission to cut the chord but tells Avery and Lexie that they were not cutting the chord and playing by ear instead. He removes all but a tiny section of the tumor. Webber discovers that Shepherd is operating and is about to put an end to it, but <a href="Arizona%20Robbins">Dr. Arizona Robbins</a> (<a href="Jessica%20Capshaw">Jessica Capshaw</a>) tells him to go away. Shepherd has to cut a nerve to remove the rest of the tumor, but does not know which will result in paralysis. He decides with a game of "<a href="Eeny%2C%20meeny%2C%20miny%2C%20moe">Eeny, meeny, miny, moe</a>", ultimately cutting the correct nerve and eliminating the entirety of the tumor. Despite the successful surgery, Webber is enraged and verbally fires Shepherd. Shepherd dismisses this in a light tone and goes home to drink champagne with his wife.

Running for 43 minutes, the episode was written by Peter Nowalk and directed by Wilson; the latter portrays Bailey. Jenny Barak edited the music and Donald Lee Harris served as the production designer. Heigl was absent from the episode, as she was filming the <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a> "<a href="Life%20as%20We%20Know%20It%20%28film%29">Life as We Know It</a>" (2010). The song featured in the episode was <a href="Bat%20for%20Lashes">Bat for Lashes</a>' "Moon and Moon", featured on their second album "<a href="Two%20Suns">Two Suns</a>". Saul, Zehetner, and Williams returned to the episode as Mostow, Adamson, and Avery, respectively, while Tahir made his first and only appearance as Isaac. The scenes in the operating room were filmed at the Prospect Studios in <a href="Los%20Feliz%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Los Feliz, Los Angeles</a>; Nowalk said the scenes were difficult to shoot, due to the technicality involved. Pompeo's appearances in the episode were scarce, as she was eight and a half months pregnant during shooting.

According to Nowalk, the idea to have Lexie wear a diaper to get through the operation was inspired by an episode of "<a href="The%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a>". He added: "It wasn't that big of a leap for us to go diaper. Our doctors are hardcore by nature." Nowalk said that this episode was primarily focused around Shepherd, which he considered an "experiment". He commented that the idea of Isaac's storyline came from Dr. Robert Bray, a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles. Nowalk intended the nature of the episode to be "different", attributing it to the fact that Heigl's character was absent. He also praised Wilson for directing the episode, commenting that "she acts, she sings, and now she directs". The majority of the episode involved Shepherd staring at his patient's tumor, contemplating what to do. Nowalk offered his insight on this: 

"Give Peace a Chance" was originally broadcast on October 29, 2009 in the United States on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC). The episode underperformed the previous installment, "<a href="I%20Saw%20What%20I%20Saw">I Saw What I Saw</a>", in terms of viewership. It was viewed by a total of 13.74 million people, down 1.66 percent from the previous episode, which garnered 15.04 million viewers. In terms of viewership, "Give Peace a Chance" ranked fourth for the night, behind game two of the <a href="2009%20World%20Series">2009 World Series</a>, and <a href="CBS">CBS</a>'s "" and "<a href="The%20Mentalist">The Mentalist</a>". The installment did not rank high for viewership, but its 5.2/13 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> ranked second in its 9:00 <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern</a> time-slot and the entire night for both the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings/share%20and%20total%20viewers">rating and share</a> percentages of the 18–49 demographic, losing to the 2009 World Series but beating "CSI", "The Mentalist", and "<a href="Private%20Practice%20%28TV%20series%29">Private Practice</a>". Although its rating was in the top rankings for the night, it was a decrease from the previous episode, which garnered a 5.6/14 rating/share in the 18–49 demographic.

Critics were largely positive in their reviews of the episode. "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" Michael Pascua called "Give Peace a Chance" a "hit and miss" episode, criticizing the slang dialogue by saying it "sounded like it came from an <a href="MTV">MTV</a> drama", but praising the installment's "character driven development". Pascua was positive on the development of Tahir's character, writing: "I hope he comes back in a later episode just to remind these people about patience and hope." "TV Fanatic" Steve Marsi gave a positive review of the episode, saying it "won [him] over", and also praising Tahir's character. Marsi applauded the development of Dempsey's character, calling him "the best [doctor]", and noted that Wilson's directing may "net her an Emmy nomination".

Writing for "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", Jennifer Armstrong had mixed feedback on the episode, writing: "The all-medical, all-the-time episodes need to stop." However, she found it "fantastic" when Shepherd drew on the wall, and enjoyed Tahir's character, calling him "lovely". Armstrong also said that "Give Peace a Chance" was in ""<a href="ER%20%28TV%20series%29">ER</a>" territory", adding: "I do not watch "Grey's Anatomy" to get my "ER" fix." Adam Bryant of "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" enjoyed this episode compared to the previous one, but disliked the possible romantic development between Karev and Adamson. In his review, he concluded that the installment "proves that Meredith Grey doesn't have to do all the heavy lifting on this show".

"<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" Carrie Bell enjoyed the episode, praising the balance of cast members. She called Isaac "beloved", and found that the teamwork in the episode proved "there's no 'I' in team". Former "<a href="Star-Ledger">Star-Ledger</a>" editor <a href="Alan%20Sepinwall">Alan Sepinwall</a> gave a positive review of the entry, applauding the shift in themes and Shepherd's character development. Writing for <a href="BuddyTV">BuddyTV</a>, Glenn Diaz found the episode comical, calling the scene in which Robbins stands up to Webber "hilarious", and naming Yang the installment's "comic relief". Referring to Shepherd and Webber's constant arguments, an "<a href="AfterEllen.com">AfterEllen</a>" senior editor said: "Seriously, these two need to drop their pants and get it over with." Peter Nowalk's writing of the episode was nominated for a <a href="Humanitas%20Prize">Humanitas Prize</a> in the 60 Minute Category. The episode also earned Wilson an <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award">NAACP Image Award</a> under the Outstanding Directing in a Dramatic Series category.

Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar

The Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar was an <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">American fifty-cent piece</a> struck in 1925 at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>. Its main purpose was to raise money on behalf of the Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association for the <a href="Stone%20Mountain">Stone Mountain Memorial</a> near <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. Designed by sculptor <a href="Gutzon%20Borglum">Gutzon Borglum</a>, the coin features a depiction of Confederate generals <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> and <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a> on the obverse and the caption: "Memorial to the Valor of the Soldier of the South" on the reverse. The piece was also originally intended to be in memory of the recently deceased president, <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, but no mention of him appears on the coin.

In the early 20th century, proposals were made to carve a large sculpture in memory of General Lee on Stone Mountain, a huge rock outcropping. The owners of Stone Mountain agreed to transfer title on condition the work was completed within 12 years. Borglum, who was, like others involved, a <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> member, was engaged to design the memorial, and proposed expanding it to include a colossal monument depicting Confederate warriors, with Lee, Jackson, and Confederate President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> leading them.

The work proved expensive, and the Association advocated the issuance of a commemorative half dollar as a fundraiser for the memorial. Congress approved it, though to appease Northerners, the coin was also made in honor of Harding, under whose administration work had commenced. Borglum designed the coin, which was repeatedly rejected by the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>. All reference to Harding was removed from the design by order of President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>.

The Association sponsored extensive sales efforts for the coin throughout the South, though these were hurt by the firing of Borglum in 1925, which alienated many of his supporters, including the <a href="United%20Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a>. A 1928 audit of the fundraising showed excessive expenses and misuse of money, and construction halted the same year; a scaled-down sculpture was eventually completed in 1970. Because of the large quantities issued—over a million remain extant—the Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar remains inexpensive compared with other U.S. commemoratives.

The first European-descended settlers inhabited the land around <a href="Stone%20Mountain%2C%20Georgia">Stone Mountain, Georgia</a>, today in the east Atlanta suburbs, around 1790. They called the large outcropping, about long and high, "Rock Mountain". Rev. Adrel Sherwood of <a href="Macon%2C%20Georgia">Macon, Georgia</a>, first named it Stone Mountain in 1825. The town of New Gibraltar was founded nearby in 1839; its name would be changed to Stone Mountain by the <a href="Georgia%20Legislature">Georgia Legislature</a> in 1947. From about the time of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the mountain was used as a quarry; this would not entirely cease until the 1970s.

John Gutzon de la mothe Borglum (usually called <a href="Gutzon%20Borglum">Gutzon Borglum</a>) was born in <a href="Idaho%20Territory">Idaho Territory</a> in 1867, to one of several wives of a Dane who had converted to <a href="Mormon">Mormon</a>ism. As a boy, Borglum lived in various places in the Far West. Turning to art as a career, he attended the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Art%20Institute">San Francisco Art Academy</a>, the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Julian">Académie Julian</a>, and the <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Beaux-Arts">École des Beaux-Arts</a>. Greatly influenced by <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Rodin</a>, whom he met, Borglum switched from painting to sculpture in 1901. His "<a href="Mares%20of%20Diomedes">Mares of Diomedes</a>" won a gold medal at the 1904 <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition">Louisiana Purchase Exposition</a> in St. Louis, and became the first work of sculpture to be purchased by the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.

In 1914, editor John Temple Graves wrote in the "<a href="Atlanta%20Georgian">Atlanta Georgian</a>", suggesting the establishment of a memorial to <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> on Stone Mountain, "from this godlike eminence let our Confederate hero calmly look history and the future in the face!" Others who called for the establishment of a Confederate memorial there included William H. Terrell, an Atlanta attorney who believed that while the North had spent millions of dollars on monuments to the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a>, the South had not sufficiently honored Confederate heroes. Also active in the early days of the Stone Mountain proposal was Helen Plane (1829–1925), who had been a belle from Atlanta before the war, and whose husband had given his life at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> in 1862. She devoted the remainder of her life to preserving the memory of the Southern cause.

The release of the film "<a href="The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Nation">The Birth of a Nation</a>" in 1915 sparked increased interest in the Confederate cause in the South. Plane, who was lifetime honorary president of the Georgia organization of the <a href="United%20Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a> (UDC), asked Borglum to carve the image of General Lee on the mountain. The Stone Mountain project was initially a UDC endeavor. Officials originally contemplated a monument of perhaps by . Putting that on Stone Mountain, Borglum supposedly stated, would be like putting a postage stamp on a barn. He proposed a much larger sculpture, high and long, and drew up plans in his <a href="Stamford%2C%20Connecticut">Stamford, Connecticut</a>, studio. He envisioned a huge depiction of the Confederate army, including artillery and infantry, as well as 65 Confederate generals, five to be nominated by the governor of each Southern state. In 1917, the Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association (the Association) was founded to publicize and raise funds for a colossal sculpture at Stone Mountain. Samuel H. Venable and his family, owners of the land, agreed to deed it over for a monument, on condition that if the project was not completed in 12 years, title would revert to them. A formal dedication took place in May 1916; the preliminary work was interrupted by the US entry into <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a> in 1917.

Another organization which took an interest in the Stone Mountain work was the recently revived <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, of which both Venable and Borglum were members. The Klan, through much of the 20th century, held regular encampments on or near Stone Mountain. Plane, in a 1915 letter to Borglum, stated that the original Klan had saved the South from "Negro domination" in the <a href="Reconstruction%20era">Reconstruction era</a>, and suggested that the design include a small group of Klansmen in robes, seen in the distance, approaching.

Beginning in 1920, the project slowly came under the control of Atlanta businessmen, brought in to aid with the massive fundraising, and the UDC became marginalized. The work on the sculpture resumed on June 18, 1923, when Borglum began carving Lee's figure into the mountainside; he planned for General <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a> and <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate President</a> <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> to be close by Lee. Borglum's plans were for a huge sculpture depicting the Confederates, a memorial hall hewn from the granite at the base of the mountain in which artworks and artifacts could be displayed (as well as rolls of honor listing the contributors) and a giant amphitheater nearby. He estimated the total cost at $3.5 million. Instead, the scope of the project was scaled back, though different sources give varying cost estimates and dimensions. Borglum signed a contract to complete the group of Lee, Jackson, and Davis within three years for a cost of $250,000.

The work was expensive and by November 1923, the Association decided to advocate for a commemorative coin which it could buy from the government at face value and sell at a premium as a fundraiser. Two men each sought credit for coming up with the idea for a coin. Daniel W. Webb, executive secretary of the Association, said he had thought of it after finding an <a href="Alabama%20centennial%20half%20dollar">Alabama centennial half dollar</a> at home; journalist Harry Stillwell Edwards made a similar claim and apparently collected a reward from the Association.
On November 16, 1923, Edwards wrote to Bascom Slemp, secretary to President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> (the previous president, <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, had recently died). Edwards arranged a meeting between the President and himself, association president Hollins N. Randolph (an Atlanta lawyer and direct descendant of early president <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>), and Borglum. President Coolidge agreed to support authorizing legislation for a Stone Mountain coin.

Borglum later stated that the Association asked him to write to people in Washington because of his contacts in the Republican Coolidge administration. He wrote to the powerful Republican Massachusetts senator, <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge">Henry Cabot Lodge</a>, urging him to support legislation for a Stone Mountain commemorative coin; the appeal apparently worked, as late in 1923 the committee chairmen having jurisdiction over coinage, <a href="Reed%20Smoot">Reed Smoot</a> in the Senate and <a href="Louis%20Thomas%20McFadden">Louis Thomas McFadden</a> in the House of Representatives, introduced legislation for a Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar. McFadden later wrote that he sponsored the legislation because of his friendship with Borglum. With the threat of sectional opposition if the coin only honored the South, the bill's sponsors included language making the new half dollar also in memory of the recently deceased Harding (an Ohioan), during whose presidency the renewed work had begun. The bill passed by <a href="unanimous%20consent">unanimous consent</a> in the House on March 6, 1924, and in the Senate five days later; Coolidge signed it on March 17. The bill authorizing the coin read:

Borglum was busy between the passage of the bill and the end of May 1924, first working on the Children's Founders Roll medal, and then the half dollar. The Children's Founders Roll was open to white children up to the age of 18 who contributed one dollar to the building of the monument. Borglum must still have been fine-tuning the monument's design; Jackson's posture on the medal differs from that on the coin. Unlike the issued coin, Borglum's models showed the front part of Davis's horse, although the Confederate president is unseen, and marching soldiers appear in the background. Borglum met with Treasury Secretary <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a> who questioned first why "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>" appeared directly over Lee's head; Borglum responded that it was to pay tribute to the Confederates' faith. Mellon then asked what the thirteen stars on the obverse represented; Borglum replied that those on the north side of the <a href="Mason%E2%80%93Dixon%20line">Mason–Dixon line</a> could consider them to represent the thirteen original colonies (those south of it, the implication was, could consider them to be a tribute to the Southern states). Mellon laughed and gave preliminary approval. On July 2, Mellon showed the designs to President Coolidge; they were then sent to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> for its members' opinions.
According to numismatists William D. Hyder and R.W. Colbert, "Borglum, to put it mildly, was a temperamental artist who managed to offend most everyone with whom he worked". They note that "Borglum's past insolence had not left him in the good graces of the art community" and his designs met a hostile reception at the commission. Sculptor member <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, designer of the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a>, rejected Borglum's initial design on July 22, eight days after they were received. The inscription on the reverse included a tribute to Harding; Fraser deemed it inartistic. Borglum submitted a second set on August 14, this was again rejected; the commission criticized the design, which seemed to be only a segment of a larger one, rather than specifically designed to fit a half dollar. Borglum wanted to ignore what he deemed "damn fool suggestions", but the Association threatened to fire him if he did not complete the coin. Borglum was concerned the reverse was still too crowded, and proposed leaving off the eagle, but space was saved when Coolidge did not like the reference to Harding, and it was omitted. With the eagle still in place on the reverse, Fraser finally approved the designs on October 10, 1924. In all, Borglum made nine plaster models for the design.

Even though all necessary approvals had been received, the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> refused to proceed with preparations because of the lack of the mention of Harding, which it believed was congressionally mandated. Borglum wired Coolidge on October 31, notifying him of the problem; the President confirmed his approval of the design the following day. Despite the support of the federal government for the coin, the <a href="Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic">Grand Army of the Republic</a> (GAR), an organization of <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> Civil War veterans, tried to prevent the issuance of a coin they believed honored treason by lobbying in late 1924 and early 1925. Work on the sculpture slowed (the head of Jackson was then being carved) because of the sculptor being distracted by designing the coin, flaws in the rock on Stone Mountain, and the fact that the Association had ceased fundraising efforts in anticipation of a campaign to sell the coin. Revenues from the medal were not sufficient to meet expenses.

The obverse of the half dollar depicts Confederate generals Lee and Jackson, the latter with head bare, mounted on horseback. Although both Lee and Jackson were respected in the North, Davis would not have been acceptable on a federal coin, and he was omitted, although he appears on the Children's Founders Roll medal which Borglum adapted for the obverse of the half dollar. There are thirteen stars in the upper field of the obverse; they represent the thirteen states which either joined the Confederacy or had Confederate factions. Borglum's initials, "GB", are found on the extreme right of the piece, near the horses' tails. The reverse depicts an eagle with wings stretched, representative of liberty, perched upon a mountaintop. There are 35 stars in the field, supposedly to represent the number of states at the start of the Civil War, although there were in fact 34 in 1861, and there were 35 states only from 1863 to 1864, between the admissions of West Virginia and Nevada.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, writing in 1971, noted that the half dollar represents an unusual circumstance in American art, where a designer uses a coin as a "<a href="bozzetto">bozzetto</a>" or small-scale model of a work to be completed. Vermeule considered the children's medal a better work of art, due to the inclusion of Davis. He believed that Borglum's original design, before its rejection by the Commission of Fine Arts, was superior, as it included a sense of motion through the depiction of marching soldiers in the background, balanced by the inclusion of the head of Davis's horse, though the Confederate president himself is unseen. According to Vermeule, the original design "would have made a magnificent coin, an unusual compression of monumentality and power into a limited and unorthodox historical space".

The <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York converted Borglum's models to coinage dies. The first 1,000 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars were struck on a medal press at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> on January 21, 1925, the 101st anniversary of General Jackson's birth; Borglum and officials of the Association were present. The first piece struck was mounted on a plate made of gold mined in Georgia for presentation to President Coolidge. The second was mounted on a silver plaque, and presented to Secretary Mellon. The remainder of the first thousand were placed in numbered envelopes; some were presented to officials or those involved in the Stone Mountain project. Between January and March 1925, that mint struck 2,310,000 of the authorized mintage of 5,000,000, plus 4,709 pieces reserved for inspection by the 1926 <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. Except for the first thousand, for which Randolph paid in gold, the pieces were sent to the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, which advanced the funds to purchase them from the government.

Although the Association unveiled the completed head of Lee on January 19, 1924 (the general's birthday), within months, its relations with Borglum had become strained. Technical problems over the medal and the work on the mountain caused tensions, and political differences between Borglum, a Republican, and Randolph, an active Democrat, led to poor relations between the two. Borglum, Venable, and Randolph backed different KKK members for national leadership. Both Borglum and the Association accused each other of graft; the sculptor proposed that he form a syndicate to purchase the half dollars from the Mint and sell them with the profits to be applied directly to construction costs. Randolph ridiculed the suggestion, stating that it would allow Borglum to carve "whatever he pleased on the mountain". Borglum accused Randolph of using donations for his own benefit, and spending freely on an expense account. These dissensions became public, and in February 1925, the Association fired Borglum. Randolph stated, as one reason for dismissing the sculptor, that Borglum had taken seven months to design the coin, when, he said, any competent artist could have done it in three weeks. He accused Borglum of delaying so that the Association would be embarrassed. According to Freeman, "despite all the points of conflict between Borglum and the committee, it was actually the commemorative coin that ended his career at Stone Mountain."

Upon being dismissed, Borglum wrecked his models for the monument; the Association sought to have him jailed for destruction of property. Borglum was addressing the ladies of the Atlanta chapter of the UDC when his assistant, Jesse Tucker, burst in and hurried him out the door with a minimum of explanation, only moments before a sheriff's deputy arrived to serve the warrant. He left the state, but was arrested in <a href="Greensboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina</a>, though quickly allowed bail, and the Association abandoned extradition proceedings. Freed, the sculptor soon took up a project in South Dakota, <a href="Mount%20Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a>. The publicity surrounding these events hurt the Association's fundraising, as did allegations that the Association had misused hundreds of thousands of dollars put aside for the project.

The Association hired <a href="Augustus%20H.%20Lukeman">Augustus H. Lukeman</a> as replacement sculptor; all of Borglum's work was eventually blasted away. Despite the dispute with Borglum, the Association proceeded to market the half dollars; it hired New York publicist Harvey Hill to run the campaign. The Association hoped for the opportunity to present the first coin to President Coolidge in person as a means of overcoming the bad publicity; White House officials warily declined, writing that "no good purpose would be served by a formal presentation". The half dollars were officially released on July 3, 1925 (though some were displayed as early as May); they were sold at a price of one dollar. They were sent to 3,000 banks by the Federal Reserve, with the proceeds from sales credited to the Association. White Southerners applauded the piece as symbolizing sectional reconciliation, the federal government paying homage to its Confederate heritage.

The coins were to be distributed through banks, and the Federal Reserve System cooperated by moving coins as needed, though at the Association's expense. The Association set up local affiliates, with organizations throughout the South, as well as Oklahoma and the District of Columbia. Each state's governor served as nominal head of the organization within his jurisdiction; on July 20, 1925, at a meeting of the <a href="Conference%20of%20Southern%20Governors">Conference of Southern Governors</a> called for the purpose, they (or their representatives) resolved that the Association allocate sales quotas among the states on the "basis of white population and bank deposits". The pieces were to be sold at the price of one dollar, and local organizations were to generate promotions for selling them. The overall drive to sell half dollars was dubbed the "Harvest Campaign" and began with the governors' meeting in July 1925. Georgia Governor <a href="Clifford%20Walker">Clifford Walker</a> told his colleagues that the "South would be eternally disgraced if it failed to accept the challenge" of meeting the sales goal of 2,500,000 coins; nevertheless, the governors devoted little time to the campaign.

Although volunteer enthusiasm was essential to the Association's plans in the Harvest Campaign, it did not rely on it at the higher levels; the state chairs were compensated, both by salary and commission. J.W. Gibbes, clerk of the <a href="South%20Carolina%20House%20of%20Representatives">South Carolina House of Representatives</a>, was hired as that state's executive director; he undertook to sell 100,000 coins and received just under $3,500 in salary and commissions, all paid in 1926. Local volunteers organized Chamber of Commerce luncheons to sell coins throughout the South; chapters of the UDC purchased pieces to present to surviving Civil War veterans. The quota for Florida was 175,000 coins, with each town and city apportioned its share. Often, <a href="Kiwanis">Kiwanis</a> or <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotary</a> groups underwrote local quotas. Mrs. N. Burton Bass of Atlanta was reported to be the leading seller, once disposing of 233 coins in an afternoon. A series of dance balls honored the UDC members who sold large numbers of pieces. Nevertheless, Hyder and Colbert suggested that there was "a general lack of more ladies such as Mrs. Bass"; many municipalities had trouble finding local chairs. Outside the South, sales were promoted by three professional publicists hired by the Association. To keep public interest high, the Association released Lukeman's conceptions for Stone Mountain, which were on a smaller scale than Borglum's. Lukeman conceived a scaled-down concept, of the three Confederate leaders on horseback. Despite the campaign, sales were slower than expected. In late 1925, the Association offered Northern banks a commission of seven cents a coin; it is uncertain if any took up the offer. The continuing opposition of the GAR to the coins dampened sales in the North, and there was considerable criticism of the coin issue in newspapers.
One means of fundraising that Harvest Campaign administrators decided on was to <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23C">counterstamp</a> some of the coins for sale at premium prices. The letters and numbers are believed to have been punched by the Association, as they are almost entirely uniform. Some were given a state abbreviation and a number, and were sent to be auctioned in various towns. Gibbes reported that the counterstamped pieces sent to South Carolina sold for an average of $23, ranging from $10 to $110, and recommended that the auctions be preceded with the account of the sale of one in <a href="Bradenton%2C%20Florida">Bradenton, Florida</a>, for $1,300. Which town got which number was the luck of the draw. Others were marked with "U.D.C." and a state abbreviation, together with a number which probably represents a membership or chapter number. These were intended for presentation to members deserving of special honor, such as an outgoing president. They did not sell well, as the Association had alienated many UDC members over the firing of Borglum. The Association also announced a program for sale to the <a href="Sons%20of%20Confederate%20Veterans">Sons of Confederate Veterans</a>, although whether any coins were sold under this program is unclear, as none have been identified. Pieces marked "G.L." and "S.L." were puzzled over by collectors for many years; A. Steve Deitert in the January 2011 edition of "The Numismatist" identified the markings as "Gold Lavalier" and "Silver Lavalier". These coins were given to county winners and runners-up in a selling competition for young women.

The Association sold coins through other means. They asked companies to purchase them: the <a href="Baltimore%20%26amp%3B%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore & Ohio Railroad</a> [B&O], the <a href="Fireman%27s%20Fund%20Insurance%20Company">Southern Fireman's Fund Insurance Company</a>, the <a href="Coca-Cola%20Company">Coca-Cola Company</a>, and a number of banks, purchased thousands of pieces, many of which were given away as promotions. Those outside the South could obtain coins by orders passed through local banks. A bank in St. Louis gave away the half dollars to those who opened an account with at least $5; the B&O used them in making change.

The Association called an end to the Harvest Campaign as of March 31, 1926, most likely because the sales did not justify the continued salary expenses. Coins remaining at banks were to be sent to the Federal Reserve, and any credit balances remitted to the Association. Thereafter, coins were available either through the Association or the Federal Reserve at an increased price of $2. With a price increase and the end to the campaign, sales plummeted. Total sales from the Harvest Campaign were about 430,000 pieces. One exception to the drop in sales was a drive in New York under the sponsorship of Mayor <a href="Jimmy%20Walker">Jimmy Walker</a>, which succeeded in selling 250,000 coins in 1926, though at the original price of one dollar. <a href="Bernard%20Baruch">Bernard Baruch</a>, then a prominent investor and later a counselor of presidents, was honorary chairman of the organizing committee, and personally subscribed for some of the pieces.

The Atlanta chapter of the UDC in 1927 published a brochure accusing the Association of wrongfully firing Borglum and wasting between a quarter and a half million dollars. An audit of the Association's books was performed in 1928; the examiners found its records in good order, excepting those regarding the Harvest Campaign, which were inadequate. The audit found that for every three dollars of revenue brought in from the half dollars, two were paid out in expenses, a ratio Hyder and Colbert called "incredible". Of the total sum raised by the Association, only 27 cents of each dollar went to the carving. Venable stated that the Stone Mountain monument had "developed into the most colossal failure in history".

The Association was discredited by the results of the audit; the Georgia Senate voted to accuse it of gross mismanagement of funds. Randolph resigned when Venable made it clear he would not negotiate an extension of the twelve-year deadline unless he did. The Atlanta lawyer had begun a political career; the scandal finished it. With funds drying up, the Association stopped work on Stone Mountain on May 31, 1928, and when negotiations failed, the Venable family successfully sued to regain the property. Borglum was now a folk hero in Atlanta; he was called upon to return to Stone Mountain in the early 1930s, but busy with Mount Rushmore, he did not. At the time of Borglum's death in 1941, no work was being done on Stone Mountain. The State of Georgia voted funds to purchase Stone Mountain in 1958 and five years later selected <a href="Walker%20Kirkland%20Hancock">Walker Kirkland Hancock</a> as architect. The sculpture, which depicts Lee, Jackson and Davis, and bears only a resemblance to Borglum's original design, was dedicated in 1970. At by , it is the largest relief sculpture in the world.

In 1930, Secretary Mellon reported that although no Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars were held by the Mint, it was his understanding that large quantities of the piece were in the possession of banks. Eventually, arrangements were made to return a million half dollars to the Mint for melting. In spite of this, the State of Georgia still had Stone Mountain half dollars for sale at its exhibit at the 1933 <a href="Century%20of%20Progress%20Exposition">Century of Progress Exposition</a>. Many more were dumped into circulation in the 1930s. A quantity of half dollars once owned by Baruch were sold for $3.25 each through a Georgia bank in the 1950s to finance a building in honor of Baruch's mother, a Southerner, in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. A total of 1,314,709 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars were distributed, after deducting those pieces melted.

Due to the large quantities extant, Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars remain inexpensive in comparison with other commemoratives. The 2014 edition of "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists the piece at $65 in Almost Uncirculated condition (AU-50) with pieces in near-pristine MS-66 at $335.

Rhodesian mission in Lisbon

The Rhodesian mission in Lisbon (), the capital of Portugal, operated from September 1965 to May 1975. It was a <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a> representing <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> (or <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>), initially as a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> of Britain and, after the <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> in November 1965, as an <a href="list%20of%20historical%20unrecognized%20states">unrecognised state</a>.
Rhodesia informed Britain of its intent to open a Lisbon mission headed by an <a href="Diplomatic%20accreditation">accredited representative</a>, independent from the Britain Embassy in the city, in June 1965. <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Whitehall</a> refused to endorse the idea but Rhodesia continued nonetheless, and later that month appointed Harry Reedman to head the mission. The British government attempted unsuccessfully to block this unilateral act—Rhodesia's first—for some months afterwards.

The affair came amid the larger dispute between Whitehall and <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a> regarding the terms under which Rhodesia could be granted <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign independence</a>. Rhodesia's mostly white government insisted that statehood should come under the constitution introduced with Britain's approval in 1961, while Whitehall insisted that a set timetable for the introduction of black majority rule would have to be in place before the country could be fully independent. The Rhodesian government's stance on this matter caused it to become isolated within the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a>, which from 1964 excluded it from most of its internal bodies, while the Rhodesian military became unofficially embargoed by its established British and American suppliers.

Rhodesia had run itself as a self-governing colony since 1923, but ultimate responsibility for foreign affairs remained with Britain. Rhodesia's staunch opposition to immediate black rule and its disillusionment regarding Britain propelled it towards Portugal, which governed <a href="Portuguese%20Angola">Angola</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, territories respectively to the west and east of Rhodesia. In their attempt to prove that an independent Lisbon mission was legal, the Rhodesians presented an argument based on British legislation conferring on the colonial government the right to appoint its own "diplomatic agents, or consular or trade representatives, in countries which are willing to receive them". The British countered that ultimate purview over Rhodesian foreign affairs still lay with Whitehall. They proposed that Reedman be integrated into the British Embassy in Lisbon as a Rhodesian <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">consul</a>, but Rhodesia refused to accept a lesser post for Reedman than those enjoyed by the independent Rhodesian representatives in South Africa and Mozambique.

Following months of abortive Anglo-Rhodesian talks and unsuccessful attempts by Britain to deter Portugal diplomatically, Reedman travelled to Lisbon in September 1965 to take up his post at the head of an independent Rhodesian mission. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Portugal%29">Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, which insisted it was neutral regarding Rhodesia, outraged Whitehall by accepting Reedman's letter of accreditation—though Lisbon was careful to avoid provoking Britain, omitting the word "diplomatic" from the titles given to both Reedman and his mission. The Rhodesians still regarded themselves as victorious, saying they had set out to gain an independent diplomatic representative in Lisbon, and now had one. The historian J R T Wood later called this "Rhodesia's first independent and indeed unilateral act—the veritable straw in the wind." On 11 November 1965, less than two months after Reedman's investiture, Rhodesia went one further and unilaterally declared its independence from Britain. The mission in Lisbon operated until 1975, when it was closed following the <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> in Portugal the previous year.

Having been <a href="company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">governed and developed</a> by the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Company">British South Africa Company</a> since the 1890s, <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a> became a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> within the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> in 1923, when it was granted <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a> by <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Whitehall</a>. The Southern Rhodesian capital, <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, was henceforth empowered to run its own affairs in almost all matters, including defence. Foreign affairs was one of the few areas reserved by the British government. As the Empire's lone self-governing colony, Southern Rhodesia was considered a "<a href="sui%20generis">sui generis</a>" case, almost on a par with a <a href="dominion">dominion</a>. Starting in <a href="British%20Empire%20Economic%20Conference">1932</a>, <a href="Imperial%20Conference">Imperial Conference</a>s included the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those from the dominions, a unique situation which continued after Imperial Conferences were superseded by <a href="Commonwealth%20Prime%20Ministers%27%20Conference">Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference</a>s in 1944.

As most of the Southern Rhodesian politicians saw it, they were as good as independent; if full autonomy were granted in the form of dominionship, the only practical difference would be a rise in expenses for foreign representation, as Salisbury would have to maintain its own embassies abroad. Believing full dominion status to be effectively symbolic and "there for the asking", Prime Minister <a href="Godfrey%20Huggins%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Malvern">Godfrey Huggins</a> (in office from 1933 to 1953) regarded independence as a non-issue. He twice refused British overtures hinting at dominion status, and instead pursued an initially semi-independent <a href="Federation%20of%20Rhodesia%20and%20Nyasaland">Federation</a> with the directly administered British colonies of <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a> and <a href="Nyasaland">Nyasaland</a>.

Mandated by the results of <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20federation%20referendum%2C%201953">the 1953 referendum</a>, Federation began later that year with Southern Rhodesia, the most developed of the three territories, at its head. Salisbury doubled as Federal capital. The Federation was granted several privileges by Britain during its earlier years; for example, a 1957 British <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> empowered it to appoint its own "diplomatic agents, or consular or trade representatives, in countries which are willing to receive them" so long as it informed Britain when it was doing so. The most prominent of these appointments was made in 1961, when the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> split from the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> and became a republic. An accredited representative of Salisbury was set up in <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a> soon after, independent of Britain's embassy there. An independent office representing the Federation was also set up in <a href="Maputo">Lourenço Marques</a>, the capital of <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Portuguese Mozambique</a>, while further afield, Federal officials were set up within the <a href="British%20Embassy%2C%20Tokyo">British embassies in Japan</a>, West Germany, and <a href="Embassy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">the United States</a>.

The Federation ultimately failed because of the shifting international attitudes and rising black nationalist ambitions of the late 1950s and early 1960s, often collectively called the <a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">Wind of Change</a>. The idea of "<a href="no%20independence%20before%20majority%20rule">no independence before majority rule</a>" gained considerable ground in British political circles as the UK, <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">France</a> and <a href="Belgian%20colonial%20empire">Belgium</a> vastly accelerated their withdrawal from the continent. Amid a flurry of bloody civil wars, military coups and other disasters, most of the new African countries became autocratic one-party states within a few years. Already wary of <a href="black%20nationalism">black nationalism</a> on racial grounds, Salisbury became increasingly antipathetic towards it as a result of these developments, particularly when the brutal <a href="Congo%20Crisis">Congo Crisis</a> caused thousands of Congolese whites to become refugees in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. In 1962, with the Federation in its constitutional death throes amid Nyasaland's clamours for secession and immediate black rule, Federal Prime Minister <a href="Roy%20Welensky">Roy Welensky</a> was horrified and outraged to be told by Britain's <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Commonwealth%20Relations">Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations</a>, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a>, that "we British have lost the will to govern." "But we haven't," retorted Julian Greenfield, Welensky's law minister.

The Southern Rhodesians presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution, they would be first in line for independence, and would receive it without major adjustments to their 1961 constitution. Indeed, intergovernmental correspondence during early 1963 did much to confirm Salisbury's belief that this was the case. While Federal break-up talks progressed, Sandys issued a <a href="letter%20of%20intent">letter of intent</a> in which he said that powers conferred on the Federal government by British legislation would transfer to Southern Rhodesia at the end of Federation. It was agreed that Salisbury would keep the Federal overseas missions in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques, as well as the British Embassy desks in <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a>, Tokyo and Washington. Arrangements for Federal dissolution concluded in mid-1963, and the Federation formally ended on 31 December that year. Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland became independent during 1964, respectively renamed Zambia and Malawi, under black majority governments. Southern Rhodesia was denied the same on the grounds that whites held too dominant a position, prompting indignation and fury from the governing <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> (RF) and its supporters. Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a>'s failure to secure independence from Britain during early 1964 led to his forced resignation and replacement by his deputy, <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, in April that year.

Two months into his premiership, Smith was deeply offended when Whitehall informed him that, for the first time since <a href="British%20Empire%20Economic%20Conference">1932</a>, Southern Rhodesia would not be represented at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference as the decision had been taken to only include fully independent states in future. The quarrel over the terms for independence caused the Southern Rhodesian military's traditional British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and motivated Britain to cut off financial aid to Salisbury around the same time. The United States promptly followed suit. Political violence between the rival black nationalist movements in Rhodesia intensified during mid-1964, leading to jail terms or preventive restriction for several prominent nationalists, and concurrent bans for their respective parties. When Northern Rhodesia became Zambia in October 1964, Southern Rhodesia dropped "Southern" from its name, and initiated legislation to this effect, but Britain refused assent, saying that the colony could not legally rename itself. Salisbury continued using the shortened name anyway.

The Rhodesian government was ardently anti-communist, and opposed immediate black rule, which Smith said would cause "the destruction of our country", pointing to ongoing events such as the Congo Crisis as evidence. Parliament remained mostly white, but Salisbury contended it had close to unanimous support from all races in pursuing independence under the 1961 constitution, citing various tests of opinion it conducted in late 1964. The Prime Minister stood obdurately against any constitutional change he believed was too radical, regarding this as a matter of national and regional security. According to his memoirs, he worked to prevent a "mad rush into <a href="one%20man%2C%20one%20vote">one man, one vote</a> with all the resultant corruption, nepotism, chaos and economic disaster which we had witnessed in all the countries around us." The <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> Cabinet of British Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, which replaced the previous <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> administration in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">October 1964</a>, did not give credence to the Rhodesian tests of opinion, and insisted on majority rule as a condition for independence. The Commonwealth repeatedly urged Britain to intervene directly should Rhodesian defiance continue, while British liberals worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style <a href="Apartheid%20in%20South%20Africa">apartheid</a>.

British policy-makers regarded Portugal as a traditional friend—the <a href="Anglo-Portuguese%20Alliance">Anglo-Portuguese Alliance</a> dated back <a href="Treaty%20of%20Windsor%20%281386%29">to 1386</a>, and both countries were in the <a href="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</a> (NATO) and the <a href="European%20Free%20Trade%20Association">European Free Trade Association</a>—but the combined strength of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">communist bloc</a> and the <a href="Asian%E2%80%93African%20Conference">Afro-Asian lobby</a> in the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> forced the British to peel back their support for the <a href="pluricontinental">pluricontinental</a> "<a href="Estado%20Novo%20%28Portugal%29">Estado Novo</a>" ("New State") during the early 1960s. Portugal's <a href="Portuguese%20Colonial%20War">Colonial War</a>, starting in Angola in 1961, pitted it against a number of guerrilla factions in its African territories, most of which subscribed to communist political thinking. Britain opposed communist encroachment into southern Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly opposed general consensus at the UN, which roundly condemned colonialism in all forms and supported communist-backed insurgencies across the region, regarding them as racial liberation movements. It therefore attempted an awkward balancing act whereby it would appear to oppose Portugal without meaningfully doing so.

Britain's stance towards Rhodesia was influenced in a similar way, with Whitehall unable to back down on the policy of no independence before majority rule without causing international uproar. Also contributory was the disproportionate sway over Britain's African policy held by <a href="Julius%20Nyerere">Julius Nyerere</a>, the President of Tanzania, who was a fervent proponent for majority rule across Africa without delay, implemented by military force if need be. British politicians deferred to Nyerere on almost every proposal they made regarding Rhodesia during the 1960s and 1970s. In the immediate post-Federal period, Britain forlornly tried to stifle Rhodesia's further <a href="Alcora%20Exercise">alignment with South Africa and Portugal</a>, realising that British influence in the region was severely limited while the three remained so closely linked. A 1965 British government memorandum described the trio as "a defiant and mutually sustaining bloc".

Great personal rapport developed between Smith and his Portuguese counterpart, <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Oliveira%20Salazar">António de Oliveira Salazar</a>. On first meeting in Portugal in September 1964, the two Prime Ministers found they shared many common views regarding race relations in their respective countries, Britain's handling of the Commonwealth, and what Smith called the "complacency of the major powers of the free world" in the face of what the pair saw as inexorable communist expansionism. After hearing Smith's argument in favour of Rhodesian independence, Salazar privately pledged Portugal's complete support. The RF called a new general election for <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201965">May 1965</a> and, campaigning on an <a href="election%20promise">election promise</a> of independence, won a clean sweep of all 50 "A"-roll seats. A week later, Wilson met with Portuguese <a href="Minister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Portugal%29">Foreign Minister</a> Alberto Franco Nogueira, whom he pressed on Portugal's secret dealings with Rhodesia. Nogueira categorically denied anything of the sort.

Following the Rhodesian Front's decisive May 1965 election victory, parliament was opened by the British-appointed <a href="Governor%20of%20Southern%20Rhodesia">Governor</a>, <a href="Humphrey%20Gibbs">Sir Humphrey Gibbs</a>, on 9 June. For the first time, Rhodesia had an official <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> who was black: <a href="Josiah%20Gondo">Josiah Gondo</a>, leader of the United People's Party, now sat opposite Smith and the all-white RF in the House of Assembly. Though Gibbs represented the British Crown in Rhodesia, he had been a local resident most of his life, and had feet in both camps, regarding himself as loyal both to Rhodesia and to the faraway monarch. While opening parliament, he told the House of Assembly that the RF's strengthened majority amounted to "a mandate to lead the country to its full independence"—later in the speech he referred to this as "our independence".
Gibbs then said that Rhodesia wished to have the best possible relations with its neighbours, and startled British observers by saying the government had informed him that it would follow recommendations made by Portugal during recent talks, and would open its own <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a> in the Portuguese capital <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> as soon as was practical. Evan Campbell, Rhodesia's <a href="High%20Commissioner">High Commissioner</a> in London, asked Whitehall the same day to endorse the appointment of Harry Reedman as Rhodesia's "<a href="Diplomatic%20accreditation">accredited representative</a>" to Portugal, reasoning that the 1957 act allowing the Federation to do so still covered Rhodesia under the principle of <a href="Succession%20of%20states">national succession</a>. The 1963 letter of intent from Sandys confirmed this in Rhodesia's eyes. Historian J R T Wood calls this "Rhodesia's first independent and indeed unilateral act—the veritable straw in the wind."

Aside from reinforcing Luso-Rhodesian relations, the Lisbon appointment was designed to secure the African nation a diplomatic foothold in Europe outside of Britain's reach and to help Salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic allies on the continent. Among other things, the Rhodesians intended to make up the shortfalls in military equipment caused by the undeclared Anglo-American arms embargo. Reedman, the former minister for immigration and tourism, was also a retired officer of the British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (where he had been involved in bomber research), and an experienced engineer and businessman: all the right ingredients, the government thought, for someone in the position to source European aircraft, weapons and other equipment, while also representing Rhodesian interests in mainland Europe.

<a href="Fenner%20Brockway%2C%20Baron%20Brockway">Lord Brockway</a>, head of the <a href="Movement%20for%20Colonial%20Freedom">Movement for Colonial Freedom</a>, believed that Rhodesia was attempting to assert "de facto" independence in the eyes of the international community by deliberately defying Britain over the Lisbon issue. "If Salisbury is permitted to claim diplomatic rights in foreign capitals, its assertion of sovereignty is accepted," he wrote in an article for the British <a href="democratic%20socialism">democratic socialist</a> weekly "<a href="Tribune%20%28magazine%29">Tribune</a>".

Britain was caught unprepared by Campbell's request, and issued no response for over a week. In the meantime Campbell, whose retirement was due, was relieved by the Rhodesian government on 10 June. His replacement, Brigadier <a href="Andrew%20Skeen%20%28Rhodesia%29">Andrew Skeen</a>, took over Campbell's London office at <a href="Embassy%20of%20Zimbabwe%2C%20London">Rhodesia House</a>, 429 <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a> six days later.

Bent on securing Reedman's investiture quickly, the Rhodesian government made it publicly known on 19 June that, pursuant to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days. Whitehall still took no action. Wilson and his Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, <a href="Arthur%20Bottomley">Arthur Bottomley</a>, were occupied at <a href="Chequers">Chequers</a>, the official country residence of the British Prime Minister, where they were entertaining the Commonwealth heads of state.

In Bottomley's absence, his office explored the issue and resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but should not be allowed to appoint another in Lisbon; a <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">consul</a> was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.

Independence talks between Britain and Rhodesia continued for a fortnight without major reference to the Reedman appointment, with Britain more concerned with discussing a possible Rhodesian <a href="unilateral%20declaration%20of%20independence">unilateral declaration of independence</a> (UDI). Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which he said were unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to hold it together by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged to go on with negotiations, saying that he did not believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line.

In dealing with the immovable Smith, Wilson's ministers adopted a programme of deliberate frustration and delay: Britain would interminably stonewall the Rhodesian Prime Minister, maintaining the facade of continued negotiation by very occasionally repeating their stance, in the hope that either Smith would back down, or his Cabinet would eventually lose faith in his negotiating prowess and replace him with somebody more malleable. Wood writes that Wilson, Bottomley and their Labour contemporaries were "distracted by their own political agendas", and did not understand the extent of Rhodesia's considerable disillusionment with Britain by this time. Effectively "kicked ... out of the Commonwealth", as Huggins later commented, a fortress mentality was developing in Salisbury, propelling it towards unilateral action. Wood concludes that Britain's maintenance of this stonewalling tactic was misjudged, and only exacerbated the Rhodesian government's feeling of alienation.

In the British <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> on 26 July, Brockway pressed <a href="Stephen%20Taylor%2C%20Baron%20Taylor">Lord Taylor</a>, the <a href="Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>, on Rhodesia's claims, arguing that failure to block the Lisbon appointment would amount to conceding "de facto" recognition to Rhodesia as an independent state. Taylor's response was that Britain remained committed to upholding its ultimate purview over Rhodesian overseas relations. Brockway then asked how Rhodesia had attained its independent office in Pretoria; surely, he said, this provided "a precedent which was rather dangerous?" Taylor replied that Pretoria and Salisbury had exchanged High Commissioners before South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961, and that Britain had granted Rhodesia special dispensation to retain the Pretoria mission thereafter. He stressed that in Britain's eyes this was no precedent for Lisbon.

The British decided to despatch one of their Commonwealth ministers to Rhodesia for talks during early July, but debated for a while over whether it should be Bottomley or his deputy, <a href="Cledwyn%20Hughes%2C%20Baron%20Cledwyn%20of%20Penrhos">Cledwyn Hughes</a>, who should be sent. Wilson considered this a matter of urgency as he had heard a rumour that Rhodesia might declare independence on its main national holiday, <a href="Rhodes%27%20Day">Rhodes' Day</a> (that year 12 July), but this proved false. On 15 July, Britain's High Commissioner to Rhodesia, <a href="John%20Baines%20Johnston">John Baines Johnston</a>, was instructed to propose a week-long round of talks between Smith and Hughes in Salisbury. Johnston was given permission to cave if the Rhodesian Prime Minister insisted on meeting with Bottomley, but this did not prove necessary: Smith cabled back on the 18th accepting Hughes' visit. The British delegation arrived in Salisbury four days later.

Discussions proceeded rapidly during the week, but did not touch on the issue of Lisbon until the fifth day, 26 July, when Hughes and Johnston met with Smith, Deputy Prime Minister <a href="Clifford%20Dupont">Clifford Dupont</a>, and Trade and Industry Minister George Rudland. Dupont opened the discussion by referring to Sandys' statement from 1963, which said the Rhodesian government would retain any rights previously granted to the Federation, which Dupont reasoned surely included the ability given in 1957 to appoint its own overseas agents if it informed Britain. As Portugal had indicated its willingness to accept a Rhodesian diplomat, Dupont said, the Rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights.

Hughes countered that he did not believe the wording of the 1957 document gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.

Smith replied that in his interpretation Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting the idea that the Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.

Hughes met with several other Rhodesian figures before leaving late on 27 July, but Lisbon remained off the programme most of the time. Just before Hughes departed, Dupont released a statement saying that Reedman would take office in Lisbon on 1 August, and would be "warmly welcomed" by the Portuguese government. Hughes decried this in a brief telephone call to Smith, but could do little more before leaving Rhodesia that evening. On 29 July, Smith fielded questions from the press, commenting on both Lisbon and the independence talks in general. He expressed the belief that Rhodesia had made more progress towards independence talking with Hughes than it ever had before, but qualified this by saying only Wilson's reply to the proposals given to Hughes would show if this were indeed true. He said that although he thought Whitehall was keen to resolve the independence issue, he did not believe their line had changed. He declared that he and the RF would not change their stance in any way. Moving to the subject of Lisbon, Smith stressed that this was separate from the independence dispute, then overruled Dupont's announcement of two days before: Reedman's appointment would remain provisional until further notice, he said.

Bottomley toured West Africa during early August, and, in Ghana and Nigeria, gave several speeches reassuring his hosts that immediate majority rule was an unconditional requirement for Rhodesian independence. He ruled out the use of military force in the event of a Rhodesian UDI, and pledged to instead end such a rebellion through economic sanctions. Bottomley's dismissal of the use of force drew damning criticism from <a href="Joshua%20Nkomo">Joshua Nkomo</a>, the imprisoned leader of the Marxist–Leninist <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20People%27s%20Union">Zimbabwe African People's Union</a>, who said this showed Britain was not serious about decolonising Rhodesia as it had its other African possessions. Meanwhile, Bottomley's comments increased anti-British sentiment. In his memoirs, Smith describes the mood in forthright terms, accusing Britain of "resorting to politics of convenience and appeasement". "We waited and waited ... [but] the British were not prepared to make a clear decision," he writes; "they were consulting the bankrupt and communist dictatorships before replying to us." Becoming exasperated by the lack of progress, even the more hesitant members of the Rhodesian government began to see the road leading towards UDI as the only one viable for them. Lisbon, however, remained the immediate bone of contention, and on this issue the Rhodesians became yet more determined not to give an inch.

Smith organised a meeting with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, with the help of Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had come to the conclusion that Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.

Johnston dismissed Smith's argument, asserting that neither the Federation nor Rhodesia had ever made such an appointment (this was actually false; the Federal government had opened independent diplomatic missions in South Africa and Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia retained them both). Johnston concluded that Rhodesia was trying to prematurely advance its international standing. The previous entrustments, he said, had been made to allow Britain and Rhodesia to cooperate subject to Whitehall's ultimate authority, and did not entitle Rhodesia to do as it liked in the field of external affairs, especially if its chosen line ran counter to Britain's. In an attempt to intimidate Smith, Johnston sternly asked why the Rhodesian Prime Minister would risk causing a major international incident by deliberately defying Britain; Smith replied that following Britain's several slights against Rhodesia over the previous year and a half, Salisbury would not accept another. The conversation continued in this manner for some time afterwards. Smith proposed that the relevant documents be examined jointly by two judges, one British and one Rhodesian, but Johnston refused this. The meeting ended without agreement.

The Rhodesian press reported extensively on the Lisbon controversy during the second half of August, generally predicting that neither Britain, Portugal nor Rhodesia would back down. While most reporters believed that Whitehall would take a strong line, few could see any way it could actually stop Reedman from taking office. On 20 August, Bottomley spoke at his final conference in <a href="Lagos">Lagos</a>, and repeated all he had previously said regarding Britain's stance on Rhodesia. Back in London three days later, he reaffirmed his previous stance regarding Lisbon, saying that he would be pleased to have a Rhodesian on the staff of the British Embassy there, but would allow no more. In the same interview, he expressed the belief that Wilson had averted a Rhodesian UDI in October the previous year by warning Salisbury of the economic consequences. Speaking in <a href="Gweru">Gwelo</a> on 27 August, Smith derided this statement, calling it "incredible". His administration had not even considered a declaration of independence then, he said, but it was contemplated now, and he believed Anglo-Rhodesian relations were at their all-time lowest ebb. He urged Britain to return to the bargaining table quickly.

The British continued their policy of stalling Smith. At the end of August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, and could not be exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.

Johnston rued bitterly that the Rhodesians had apparently made practical arrangements for an independent office in Lisbon anyway, even going to the trouble of renting the prospective mission premises. He repeated the claim he had made in the meeting with Smith on 18 August, saying once more that the Federal government had not made appointments off its own bat. He accepted that there was an independent Rhodesian envoy in Pretoria, but argued that this was the result of South Africa's enforced withdrawal from the Commonwealth. He did not mention the Rhodesian (formerly Federal) office in Lourenço Marques, which Wood comments could be considered "precedent for Portugal".

On 5 September, the Salisbury "Sunday Mail" reported that Smith was standing firm on Reedman's absolute independence in Lisbon, and that Portugal had accepted the envoy. British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="Michael%20Stewart%2C%20Baron%20Stewart%20of%20Fulham">Michael Stewart</a> reacted with alarm, convening an urgent meeting the same day with Hughes and Sir Archibald Ross, Britain's ambassador to Portugal. Here Hughes proposed hauling Portugal over the coals, insisting that the Lisbon mission represented "creeping independence" for Rhodesia, and therefore had to be stopped.

Ross disagreed, reasoning this would only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free Trade Association and more. There was much at stake; Britain enjoyed an annual <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>48 million <a href="Balance%20of%20trade">trade surplus</a> with Portugal, and <a href="Comboios%20de%20Portugal">Portuguese Railways</a> was in the process of buying 50 <a href="diesel%20locomotive">diesel locomotive</a>s from <a href="English%20Electric">English Electric</a>. In the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> archipelago, Portugal provided NATO with a strategically key air base, which was unprotected by treaty; given the inclination, Lisbon might close it.

Hughes insisted that there was nothing more they could do to deter Rhodesia directly; they had already threatened to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy in Washington, with no effect. The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the matter with Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.

The same day, Bottomley wrote to Smith, saying that he and Wilson were disheartened by the lack of progress regarding both independence and the Lisbon appointment. He was willing to visit Rhodesia personally, but could not come until October because he had to be in <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> to attend the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29%20Conference">Labour Party Conference</a>, due to commence on 26 September. The next morning, on 8 September, Johnston told Smith that if Reedman proceeded to Portugal in open disregard for Britain's wishes, it would negatively affect future independence negotiations. Rhodesia's delay in justifying the appointment was also having a detrimental affect, Johnston asserted. Finally, he threatened to evict the Rhodesian envoys from Washington, Bonn and Tokyo if Rhodesia did not desist. Smith was yet again unmoved. Any procrastination regarding Lisbon was Britain's fault, he insisted. He told Johnston to wait for the afternoon session in Rhodesia's Legislative Assembly to hear Dupont's official announcement of Reedman's appointment, as well as the full Rhodesian explanation behind it.

Smith said he understood this would irk the British, but insisted that he and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.

Johnston protested that the British government could not take part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.

Meanwhile, Stewart and Ross argued with Nogueira and the Portuguese "<a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a>" in London, José Manuel de Villas-Boas de Vasconcellos Faria. On 8 September, Nogueira said the Portuguese were accepting Reedman as a Rhodesian representative, but were not defining his status as they wished to remain neutral in what they regarded as an exclusively Anglo-Rhodesian problem. So far as he could see, Nogueira said, Portugal had done no harm to British interests. Stewart firmly told Nogueira that Britain expected Portugal to make a statement within 24 hours saying that it would not deal with Reedman while he remained off the British Embassy staff. Nogueira replied that his government was not going to accord official diplomatic recognition to Reedman, and that Dupont understood this. Ross now threatened to involve NATO if Portugal did not thoroughly explain its conduct. Unmoved, Nogueira said this surprised him; if the British were so keen to have Reedman on the staff at their embassy, he answered, that was down to them. Portugal was totally neutral in the affair, he insisted.

Britain vigorously rallied other NATO countries to take a stand against Portugal over Reedman. France warned that NATO pressure was unlikely to yield results in his matter, but Belgium's NATO representative, André de Staercke, agreed to challenge Salazar on 11 September. At his meeting with de Staercke, Salazar denied that Portugal was giving Rhodesia its own diplomatic representation, and said there had been some misunderstanding. Portugal would not obstruct Reedman's entry should he arrive, Salazar said, as he was travelling on a (Rhodesian-issued) <a href="British%20passport">British passport</a>. On 14 September, Nogueira's ministry released a statement saying that if Britain challenged Portugal over Rhodesia at NATO, Lisbon would "use the greatest firmness to repel any attempt to attribute particular responsibilities or to make criticism of Portugal's position".

Britain raised the issue formally in the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Council">North Atlantic Council</a>, NATO's most senior political governing body, the same day. Here Portugal's delegate, Vasco da Cunha, argued that given the standing existence of independent Rhodesian offices in Lourenço Marques, Pretoria and London, the matter was between Britain and Rhodesia, and not Portugal's business. Rhodesia had simply asked to have Reedman head a representative office in Lisbon, and he would not present a letter of accreditation. If Rhodesia had exaggerated this, da Cunha said, that was not Portugal's concern. The Italian, Belgian, Danish, French and U.S. delegates in turn sided with Britain, and collectively asked da Cunha to tell his government to publicly declare its non-acceptance of Reedman while he lacked British approval. Da Cunha refused, saying this would only irritate his compatriots "because of the neglect by their allies of their interests in the past". The meeting broke up without agreement. Whitehall was pleased with the pro-British sentiment displayed therein, while Lisbon remained unmoved.

Having spent the previous week in London, Reedman flew into <a href="Lisbon%20Portela%20Airport">Lisbon Portela Airport</a> on 15 September 1965. He was met there by the Portuguese Foreign Ministry's assistant chief of protocol, Luis Quartim Bastos, and three Rhodesian officials, who had arrived a fortnight before. Nobody from the British Embassy was present. Bastos told a reporter that he was at the airport on Nogueira's behalf to accord Reedman "the classic welcome for the arrival of heads of mission". Speaking the next day, Reedman appeared genial and optimistic. "We [Portugal and Rhodesia] have everything in common," he said, "including the will for survival, an awareness of the true situation overseas, and a greater feeling towards what we are doing."

Two days later, Dupont announced that he had issued a letter of accreditation to Reedman for presentation to Nogueira. The envoy would not present <a href="letter%20of%20credence">credentials</a>, Dupont explained, as he was representing the Rhodesian government, and not its <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>, Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>. The Deputy Prime Minister expressed confusion regarding the appointment's discussion at NATO, saying that Rhodesia was far outside the organisation's geographical area of responsibility. He said that the letter of accreditation would confer on Reedman the title of "Accredited Diplomatic Representative", and that Reedman would thereafter head the "Rhodesian Diplomatic Mission" in Lisbon, which would operate on the same level as the Rhodesian office in Pretoria. The Portuguese Foreign Ministry quickly issued a statement correcting Dupont's wording, saying that Reedman would lead the "Rhodesian Mission", with no reference to diplomatic status.

To Britain's alarm and indignation, the Portuguese government announced on 21 September that Nogueira had accepted "a letter of introduction" from Reedman, conferring upon him the title "Chief of the Rhodesian Mission", with powers to deal with the Portuguese Foreign Ministry in Luso-Rhodesian matters without British interference. This followed the precedent set by Reedman's counterpart in South Africa, the statement said. Speaking publicly in Salisbury the same evening, Dupont told reporters that there had never been any intention to claim ambassadorial status for Reedman, and that Rhodesia had constantly kept Britain informed of what was happening regarding the appointment. So far as he was concerned, he said, the Rhodesian government had achieved its objective of attaining an independent diplomatic representative in Portugal, and had not exceeded its mandate in any way while doing so. Britain protested strenuously, saying Portugal was going back on its word. Portugal insisted that its reception of Reedman and his Lisbon mission did not prejudice Britain's responsibility over Rhodesia, and was justified because of the long-standing ties between Portugal and Rhodesia, as well as their common involvement in many southern African issues.

Reedman carried instructions from Salisbury to spend up to £3 million on European weapons, aircraft and equipment as soon as he could. The Rhodesian government now believed that it would almost certainly declare independence unilaterally and, knowing the purchase of materiel would be more difficult following this, wished to have the <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">Rhodesian Security Forces</a>' necessary ammunition, weapons, spare parts and other equipment in place beforehand. Soon after arriving in Portugal, Reedman contacted the Lisbon-based Zoio brothers, José, Luiz and Jean, who had recently supplied the <a href="Portuguese%20Armed%20Forces">Portuguese Armed Forces</a> in Angola with British-made weapons in direct contravention of NATO's embargo against arming Portugal's African-based troops. The Zoios were interested in stocking Rhodesia's arsenal, and promptly agreed to arrange an order of weapons from a third party on Reedman's behalf in exchange for a <a href="letter%20of%20credit">letter of credit</a> from the Rhodesian government.

Pretending their client was the government of Pakistan, the Zoio brothers contacted a licensed arms dealer from England, Major W R L Turp <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a> of <a href="Bexley">Bexley</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, who quickly agreed in principle, requesting a letter of credit from a <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> bank and appropriate <a href="end-user%20certificate">end-user certificate</a>s for the weapons. Meanwhile, Reedman's <a href="military%20attach%C3%A9">military attaché</a>, Wing Commander John Mussell, travelled to Belgium to buy starter cartridges for the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Avon">Rolls-Royce Avon</a> 109 jet engines used by the <a href="Rhodesian%20Air%20Force">Royal Rhodesian Air Force</a>'s <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> bombers, as well as engines for Rhodesia's <a href="Hawker%20Hunter">Hawker Hunter</a> jet fighters, which were produced in Belgium under licence from Britain.

On 24 September, Reedman appeared on Portugal's state-owned national radio station, <a href="R%C3%A1dio%20e%20Televis%C3%A3o%20de%20Portugal">Emissora Nacional de Radiodifusão</a>, addressing the Portuguese nation as "head of the Rhodesian diplomatic mission to Portugal". He spoke along lines reminiscent of Smith's speech to parliament on 30 June, saying the Afro-Asian element "made a mockery of the Commonwealth" and enabled Chinese-initiated communist encroachment into Africa. More than one Commonwealth member state hosted training facilities for black communist guerrillas, he said, which threatened all "civilised states in Africa". He dismissed one man, one vote as false "trash democracy", and said that in the present geopolitical climate countries run by black Africans inevitably destroyed themselves. "This your Rhodesian neighbour will not in any circumstances allow," he pledged. "We [Portugal and Rhodesia] stand together in a common cause because of civilisation."

Ross rebuked Nogueira for allowing the broadcast, saying its content was insidious and goading. Nogueira agreed that Reedman's words were provocative, but said Portugal could not be blamed as it did not censor public broadcasts. Britain considered withdrawing Ross in protest, but its Foreign Office ruled this out, saying Britain could not afford to be without an ambassador in Lisbon to influence Portugal's actions in the event of UDI. British Cabinet Secretary <a href="Burke%20Trend%2C%20Baron%20Trend">Burke Trend</a> rejected this view, pointing to Lisbon's conduct regarding Reedman, which he said showed the Portuguese "ha[d] very clearly made up their minds" to support a Rhodesian UDI. The British ambassador would not be able to affect matters, he surmised, and British interests would be better served by immediately taking a firm hand against Portugal, in the hope that this would send a strong message to Rhodesia. Ross then protested to the Portuguese about Reedman's calling himself "head of the Rhodesian diplomatic mission" on the radio; Lisbon replied impassively that this was a private expression of views by Reedman, and not Portugal's responsibility.

While the British remained firmly against separate Rhodesian representation in Lisbon, there was little they could do to stop it. Ross was nominally put on extended leave, but not withdrawn. Deciding that he could no longer wait for Bottomley to fulfil his promise to visit Rhodesia during October, Smith resolved to instead meet with Wilson personally in London, and arranged to travel on 3 October, arriving the next day. While Smith prepared to travel, Britain continued its frantic efforts to carry international anti-Rhodesian sentiment, among other things urging each NATO member government not to deal with Reedman. In London, Britons who sympathised with Smith came out to support him in large numbers, surprising both the British and the Rhodesians. The two Prime Ministers' talks were largely unproductive, and little common ground was found before Smith flew home on 12 October.

Two weeks later, Wilson travelled to Salisbury to continue the talks. The British Prime Minister proposed that future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament might be safeguarded by the revocation of some of Salisbury's self-governing powers, held since 1923. This was a horrific prospect in the eyes of his Rhodesian opponents, and proved the final straw for Smith's government. The <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> was signed by the Rhodesian Cabinet on 11 November 1965, to almost unanimous international acrimony. The next day the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> passed <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20216">Resolution 216</a>, which condemned the declaration as an illegal one "made by a racist minority", and called on all member states to withhold <a href="diplomatic%20recognition">diplomatic recognition</a>.

Smith was confident that the British military would never agree to engage in what he said would be a "fratricidal war" against Rhodesia; he was proven correct when a British <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> council, convened by Wilson and headed by <a href="Denis%20Healey">Denis Healey</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a>, determined such intervention "impossible", citing various logistical problems, the danger of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian attack on Zambia, and the psychological issues that would surely accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops. Wilson therefore put all his eggs in the sanctions basket, predicting in January 1966 that the embargo would bring Rhodesia to its knees "within a matter of weeks rather than months". The UN embargo proved ineffective, largely because both Portugal and South Africa refused to participate. Both declared themselves neutral in the Rhodesian affair, and continued to supply Rhodesia with vital resources such as oil, both at a governmental level and privately. Portugal provided the seaports of Mozambique and the oil refinery at Lourenço Marques. Car stickers marked ""—"Thank You Mozambique"—quickly became popular with white Rhodesian motorists.

Clandestine trade with other nations continued, initially at a reduced level; among other things, Portugal illicitly labelled unsold Rhodesian tobacco as Mozambican product, then sold it on Salisbury's behalf in Europe and Asia. Through this and a series of similar sanction-busting operations Rhodesia avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson, and, with the help of South Africa and Portugal, gradually became more self-sufficient. Aiming to directly cut off the main supply lines of oil to Rhodesia, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at <a href="Beira%2C%20Mozambique">Beira</a> and Lourenço Marques, Wilson set up the <a href="Beira%20Patrol">Beira Patrol</a>, a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> squadron based in the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a>, in March 1966. This blockade was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20221">Resolution 221</a>. Too small to cover both Beira and Lourenço Marques, and unable to legally fire on tankers once they were in Portuguese waters, the patrol met with little success, but it endured regardless for nearly a decade.
The Zoios' clandestine transaction with Turp initially progressed well, but fell apart in March 1966, when Turp discovered he would actually be arming Rhodesia rather than Pakistan, reacted with alarm and informed the British government. The British <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> tightened its control over arms transactions, and encouraged its NATO counterparts to do the same, while the Zoios turned their attention to Belgian, Italian and West German arms dealers. In October 1966, a huge consignment of army and air force equipment arrived in Rhodesia from the seaports of Mozambique, with many of the containers bearing metropolitan Portuguese markings. Prominent among the European weapons were <a href="FN%20FAL">FN FAL</a> battle rifles from Belgium, which allowed an unofficial Rhodesian trade delegation to operate quietly in spite of the sanctions.

Rhodesia's Lisbon mission remained open throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, providing a key link between the Rhodesian and Portuguese governments, which remained close. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970, Portugal bowed to British diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul-general, João de Freitas Cruz, from Salisbury, but the Rhodesian office in Lisbon remained open. With the <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> of 1974, Portugal's African policy was suddenly reversed. By contrast to the former authoritarian government, which had been committed to a pluricontinental Portugal, fighting costly wars against independence movements in its African territories to maintain it, the new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from Africa as quickly as possible. Following hurried negotiations between Portugal and the nationalist guerrillas in each territory, both Mozambique and Angola became independent under communist governments in 1975. Lisbon's stance on Rhodesia altered accordingly. The Portuguese government ordered the closure of the Rhodesian mission in April 1975, and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia. The Rhodesian mission in Lisbon formally closed on 1 May 1975.

Abuwtiyuw

The <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> dog Abuwtiyuw, also transcribed as Abutiu (died before 2280 BC), was one of the earliest documented domestic animals whose name is known. He is believed to have been a royal guard dog who lived in the <a href="Sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth Dynasty</a> (2345–2181 BC), and received an elaborate ceremonial burial in the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Giza Necropolis</a> at the behest of a pharaoh whose name is unknown.

An inscribed stone listing the gifts donated by the pharaoh for Abuwtiyuw's funeral was discovered by Egyptologist <a href="George%20Andrew%20Reisner">George A. Reisner</a> in October 1935. It was apparently part of the <a href="spolia">spoil material</a> incorporated into the structure of a Sixth Dynasty <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a> (pharaonic-era tomb) after the demolition of the funerary chapel belonging to Abuwtiyuw's owner, where the stone likely had originally been installed. The white <a href="limestone">limestone</a> tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2 cm (21.3×11.1×9.1 in). The inscription is composed of ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated by vertical lines.

Abuwtiyuw appears to have been a <a href="sighthound">sighthound</a>, a lightly built hunting dog similar to a <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>, with erect ears and a curly tail. The tomb in which his tablet was discovered is in <a href="Giza%20West%20Field%23Cemetery%20G2100">Cemetery G 2100</a> in Giza West Field, close to the western side of the <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a> (<a href="Pyramid%20of%20Khufu">Pyramid of Khufu</a>/Kheops).

<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> documents that in <a href="ancient%20Persia">ancient Persia</a> dogs were protected animals, held in the highest esteem during their lifetime. According to the ancient Greeks, dogs in ancient Egypt were treated with the same respect as they were in Persia, and were commonly <a href="mummy">mummified</a> after death before being buried in family tombs. The ancient Egyptians and others of the Near East believed that dogs were spiritual beings, similar to humans, and they were "often associated with particular deities and the powers they wield". A number of the early dynastic royal burial grounds contain the graves of dogs, along with women and servants of the royal household. <a href="Ashkelon">Ashkelon</a> cemetery in the <a href="Southern%20District%20%28Israel%29">Southern District</a> of <a href="Israel">Israel</a> is perhaps the best-documented dog cemetery in the ancient world, but dog mummies have been unearthed en masse in sites across Egypt including <a href="Rhoda%20Island">Rhoda</a> in Upper Egypt, <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a>, <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>, and near <a href="Maghagha">Maghagha</a>.

The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from cats and <a href="gazelle">gazelle</a>s to <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s, <a href="baboon">baboon</a>s, and birds. Typically, many animal species were consumed as meat after death, but it is highly unlikely that dogs would have been eaten. <a href="Radiograph">Radiograph</a>s of exhumed dogs in the ancient world have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a>, the <a href="Cynocephaly">jackal-headed</a> <a href="Egyptian%20pantheon">deity</a> associated with mummification and the <a href="Afterlife%23Ancient%20Egypt">afterlife</a> in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">ancient Egyptian religion</a>.

The only source from which Abuwtiyuw is known is a stone inscription tablet that may have come from the funerary chapel of the dog's owner. The tablet was apparently among spolia used to build another grave in approximately 2280 BC, a sixth-Dynasty <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a>, after the chapel's demolition. It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist <a href="George%20Andrew%20Reisner">George A. Reisner</a> during a joint <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>-<a href="Boston%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Boston Museum of Fine Arts</a> expedition, and removed from the site four days later.

The find was recorded by the main expedition photographer, Mohammedani Ibrahim, who took more than 9,321 large-format glass-plate images on Reisner's expeditions. The tablet is now held by the <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Egyptian Museum</a> in Cairo (inventory number JE 67573).

Neither the dog's grave nor mummy have been recovered. The tomb in which the tablet was unearthed is in <a href="Giza%20West%20Field%23Cemetery%20G2100">Cemetery G 2100</a> in Giza West Field, close to the western side of the <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a> (Pyramid of <a href="Khufu">Khufu</a>/Kheops). The white <a href="limestone">limestone</a> tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2 cm (21.3×11.1×9.1 in) and is inscribed with ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated from each other by vertical lines. Part of a <a href="leash">leash</a> is visible on the upper-right corner, suggesting that the tablet displayed an image of Abuwtiyuw with his owner.

The text of the inscription translated by Reisner describes the gifts offered by the pharaoh in tribute at Abuwtiyuw's funeral:

Although it was common to bury dogs in ancient Egypt, the funeral of Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate, an honour normally reserved for upper-class humans. The pharaoh's gifts suggest that the corpse was mummified, as was commonly done with humans at the time, in the belief that the "<a href="Ka%20%28Egyptian%20soul%29%23Ka%20%28vital%20spark%29">Ka</a>" of the dead would enter into its afterlife through the ceremonial burial.

Although no images of Abuwtiyuw have been found, the text characterizes him as "<a href="wikt%3A%E1%B9%AFzm">ṯzm</a>" (<a href="Tesem">Tesem</a>), a lightly built hunting dog similar to a <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>, with erect ears and a curly tail. The Tesem dog features in <a href="Prehistoric%20Egypt">predynastic</a> depictions, making it one of the oldest known breeds of dog, and images of it are common throughout Ancient Egyptian history. According to Reisner, the name "Abuwtiyuw" is not fully translatable, but he surmised that "ꜥbw" "("abuw")" is an <a href="Onomatopoesis">onomatopoeic</a> representation of a dog's bark, as this component often is found in Ancient Egyptian dog names. Edward C. Martin Jr. claims that the name means "With Pointed Ears", which would fit the description of the Tesem.

Michael Lee Capel (born October 13, 1961) is a former <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) right-handed <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> who played for the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a>, and <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a>. In 49 career games, Capel pitched 62.1 <a href="Innings%20pitched">innings</a>, <a href="strikeout">struck out</a> 43 <a href="Batting%20%28baseball%29">batters</a>, and had a career <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win–loss record</a> of 3–4 with a 4.62 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA). While he played in MLB, Capel stood at and weighed . A <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> in college and parts of his <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league baseball</a> career, he converted to <a href="Relief%20pitcher">relief pitching</a> while in Chicago's minor league system.

The <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> chose Capel in the 24th round of the <a href="1980%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1980 MLB draft</a>, but Capel did not sign with the team: instead, he opted to attend the <a href="University%20of%20Texas">University of Texas</a>. Capel played on the 1982 USA College All-Star Team, which competed in the <a href="1982%20Amateur%20World%20Series">Amateur World Series</a> in <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a> and placed third. The next year, Capel and the <a href="Texas%20Longhorns%20baseball">Texas Longhorns</a> won the <a href="College%20World%20Series">College World Series</a>. After he was drafted by the Cubs, Capel left Texas and signed to play professional baseball; he played in six seasons of <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league baseball</a> before he made his MLB debut in 1988. Capel spent the entire 1989 season in <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Triple-A</a>, one level below the majors, but the Cubs released him at the end of the year. He agreed to terms with the Brewers and played in MLB after an injury opened a spot on Milwaukee's roster, but was again released at the end of the season. A free agent, the Astros signed Capel, and over the course of the season he pitched in 25 games for the team. He spent the final part of his career in the Astros <a href="farm%20team">farm system</a>, and after he made the 1992 Triple-A <a href="All-star%20game">All-Star team</a>, Capel played his last season in 1993. After retirement, Capel worked as the general manager of a car dealership in <a href="Houston">Houston, Texas</a>.

Capel was born on October 13, 1961, in <a href="Marshall%2C%20Texas">Marshall, Texas</a>, and attended <a href="Spring%20High%20School">Spring High School</a> in <a href="Harris%20County%2C%20Texas">Harris County</a>. As a child, he enjoyed watching the Astros play on weekends. During his senior year in 1979, the Spring Lions won the AAAA <a href="Athletic%20conference">conference</a> state championship, and Capel was named to the All-State team, composed of the best high school players in the state. He set several pitching records at Spring High School. Future teammate <a href="Calvin%20Schiraldi">Calvin Schiraldi</a> called Capel a "hard thrower when he came out of high school" and "the top guy out of the state in 1980"; <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a> said he was "probably the best pitcher in the state at that time". The Philadelphia Phillies <a href="Draft%20%28sports%29">drafted</a> Capel with the 605th overall pick in the 1980 MLB Draft, but instead of signing with the Phillies, he chose to attend the University of Texas.

Capel enrolled at the University of Texas in 1981, but did not play baseball, as stretched ligaments in his elbow forced him to miss his freshman season. Capel pitched <a href="sidearm">sidearm</a>ed for the remainder of his collegiate career to compensate for a loss in the velocity of his <a href="fastball">fastball</a>. In 1982, he was named to the All-<a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a> team and pitched to a 9–0 <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win–loss record</a> with a 3.68 ERA, as the Longhorns finished 59–6. His 1982 winning percentage of 1.000 ties him with 10 others for the best single-season winning percentage in Longhorns history (with a minimum of nine <a href="Decision%20%28baseball%29">decisions</a>). At the <a href="1982%20College%20World%20Series">1982 College World Series</a>, Texas defeated the <a href="Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys%20baseball">Oklahoma State Cowboys</a> and the <a href="Stanford%20Cardinal%20baseball">Stanford Cardinal</a>, but losses to the <a href="Miami%20Hurricanes%20baseball">Miami Hurricanes</a> and the <a href="Wichita%20State%20Shockers%20baseball">Wichita State Shockers</a> eliminated them from play per the tournament's <a href="Double-elimination%20tournament">double-elimination</a> format. Capel played on the United States team in the <a href="1982%20Amateur%20World%20Series">1982 Amateur World Series</a> overseen by the <a href="International%20Baseball%20Federation">International Baseball Federation</a>. Starting against Australia, he pitched a 14–4 <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a> victory, as the match ended after seven innings per the championship's <a href="ten-run%20rule">ten-run rule</a>. The United States eventually placed third in the competition.

The 1983 Longhorns finished with a 61–14 record and were ranked as the number one team in the nation by "<a href="Collegiate%20Baseball%20Magazine">Collegiate Baseball Magazine</a>". That season, the Texas team featured four future MLB pitchers: Capel, Clemens, <a href="Bruce%20Ruffin%20%28baseball%29">Bruce Ruffin</a>, and Schiraldi. In the <a href="1983%20College%20World%20Series">1983 College World Series</a>, Capel allowed four <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a>s in a complete game against the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20baseball">Michigan Wolverines</a> as the Longhorns advanced to the World Series finals. Facing the <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20baseball">Alabama Crimson Tide</a>, the Longhorns made Clemens their <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> and won 4–3. The championship was the fourth World Series title in University of Texas history, and their first since 1975. Capel finished the season with a 13–1 record and a 2.98 ERA. His career winning percentage (.957) ties him with Rick Burley for the fifth-best in Texas Longhorns history. In June, before the College World Series, he was drafted by the Cubs with the 320th overall pick in the <a href="1983%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1983 MLB draft</a>.

After he signed a professional contract with the Cubs, Capel no longer threw sidearmed. Capel began professional baseball with the <a href="Class%20A%20%28baseball%29">Class A</a> <a href="Quad%20Cities%20River%20Bandits">Quad Cities Cubs</a>, but was promoted to the <a href="Double-A%20%28baseball%29">Double-A</a> <a href="Midland%20RockHounds">Midland Cubs</a> shortly into the season. Over 11 games, he finished with a 4–3 record and a 3.51 ERA. In 1984, Capel split playing time between the <a href="Class%20A-Advanced">Class A-Advanced</a> <a href="Lodi%20Crushers">Lodi Crushers</a> and Midland; he led Midland in losses (10) and <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a>es (11) and had the second-worst ERA (6.31) on the team. With Midland, Capel started 11 games out of the 16 in which he appeared. On his 0–7 record for the Crushers, Tom Alexander of the "<a href="Lodi%20News-Sentinel">Lodi News-Sentinel</a>" wrote that Capel's luck "has been all bad when it comes to wins". Both Lodi and Midland finished their seasons with losing records.

From 1985–86, he played for the Double-A <a href="Pittsfield%20Cubs">Pittsfield Cubs</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20League%20%28baseball%29">Eastern League</a>. In 1986, Capel only <a href="relief%20pitcher">pitched in relief</a>, had a career-best 1.87 ERA over 62.2 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings pitched</a>, and led his team with 13 <a href="save%20%28baseball%29">saves</a>. After he was promoted to the <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Triple-A</a> <a href="Iowa%20Cubs">Iowa Cubs</a>, Capel split time between <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting</a> and relieving roles in 1987. At 7–10, Capel tied for Iowa's lead in wins and losses, and led the team in <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s, with 75; his 7 wins became a career high, and his loss total matched a career high set in Midland three years earlier. After the season, Ray Sons of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" said Capel "may be ready for middle relief in Chicago", and Dave van Dyck listed him as a <a href="Prospect%20%28sports%29">prospect</a> for the 1988 season. During winter, Capel, <a href="Greg%20Maddux">Greg Maddux</a>, <a href="Manny%20Trillo">Manny Trillo</a>, <a href="Damon%20Berryhill">Damon Berryhill</a>, and several other Cubs played for teams in the Caribbean. Capel played for the <a href="%C3%81guilas%20del%20Zulia">Águilas del Zulia</a> of Venezuela and led the team with five saves.

Capel played in <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> ball as he tried to make Chicago's opening day roster. After the Cubs acquired <a href="Mike%20Bielecki">Mike Bielecki</a> from the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> on March 31, 1988, they assigned Capel to Triple-A despite a "Sun-Times" prediction that he would be on the MLB roster. Prior to the acquisition, when <a href="Al%20Nipper">Al Nipper</a> was supposed to become the Cubs' fifth starter, Capel was to take his spot in the <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a>. The Cubs recalled Capel and <a href="Mark%20Grace">Mark Grace</a> to the majors on May 3, while <a href="Drew%20Hall">Drew Hall</a> and <a href="Rolando%20Roomes">Rolando Roomes</a> were <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20transactions%23Options">optioned</a> to Iowa; at the time, he had a 1.54 ERA and two saves in Triple-A ball. On May 7, Capel made his MLB debut: he pitched the final 1.2 innings of a game against the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>, allowing no runs and no <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> but issuing a <a href="base%20on%20balls">walk</a> in a 2–1 Cubs loss. His first career win came the following day against the Giants, although he <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28B%29%23blown%20save">blew a save</a> by giving up a two-run <a href="home%20run">home run</a> to <a href="Bob%20Brenly">Bob Brenly</a> and lost a 5–4 lead. The Cubs ultimately won 13–7. Capel continued to pitch for the club until June 30, when the Cubs optioned him to Iowa to open a roster spot for <a href="Goose%20Gossage">Rich "Goose" Gossage</a> to come off the 15-day <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a> (DL).

He returned to the MLB club on August 8 to replace Schiraldi, but was demoted on August 13 before making an appearance, as Chicago activated <a href="Les%20Lancaster">Les Lancaster</a> from the DL. Capel rejoined the club on August 31, and pitched in five more games before the season's end. Over his first MLB season, Capel pitched in 20 games and allowed 16 <a href="earned%20run">earned run</a>s over 29.1 innings for a 4.91 ERA. He pitched the entire 1989 season for Iowa, appearing in 64 games for the team. On October 15, Capel was granted free agency by the Cubs; he signed with the Brewers two months later.

Capel competed against 22 other pitchers for an MLB roster spot in the Brewers' spring training camp. The Brewers optioned Capel to their Triple-A affiliate, the <a href="Denver%20Zephyrs">Denver Zephyrs</a>, on April 5, before the start of Milwaukee's 1990 season. On May 17, Denver placed Capel on the DL with a strained <a href="Achilles%20tendon">Achilles tendon</a>, which opened a roster spot on the Zephyrs and allowed the Brewers to send <a href="Jaime%20Navarro">Jaime Navarro</a> back to Denver. When the Brewers needed a replacement for the injured <a href="Bill%20Wegman">Bill Wegman</a>, Capel was called up to the major leagues. For his Brewers debut, Capel faced five batters and allowed four runs (two charged to Capel) against the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. His strikeout of <a href="Billy%20Ripken">Billy Ripken</a> was the only MLB <a href="Out%20%28baseball%29">out</a> Capel recorded in 1990. On June 8, he made his second and final outing with the Brewers and allowed four runs (three charged to Capel) against the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>; combined, batters hit .857 against Capel as he finished the season with a 135.00 ERA. When <a href="Greg%20Vaughn">Greg Vaughn</a>, returning from a <a href="Metatarsophalangeal%20joint%20sprain">turf toe</a> injury and a sprained left ankle, was activated from the DL on June 11, Capel was sent to Triple-A. He finished the season with Denver where he had a 4–3 record with a 4.26 ERA. On October 4, the Brewers granted Capel free agency; he signed with the Astros on January 5, 1991.

Capel began his 1991 season with the Triple-A <a href="Tucson%20Toros">Tucson Toros</a>; the Astros added Capel to their MLB roster on June 7. Two days later, against the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>, Capel allowed the game-winning home run to <a href="Howard%20Johnson%20%28baseball%29">Howard Johnson</a> in the top of the 11th inning. Against the Mets on June 14, Capel, starting pitcher <a href="Pete%20Harnisch">Pete Harnisch</a>, and closer <a href="Jim%20Clancy%20%28baseball%29">Jim Clancy</a> combined for a four-hitter. His final MLB appearance came on August 14 against the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a>, when he pitched one inning in relief of <a href="Jim%20Corsi%20%28baseball%29">Jim Corsi</a> in a 4–1 loss. Capel said that pitching for Houston was "the high point of my career". Over 25 games pitched, Capel finished the season with a 1–3 record and a 3.03 ERA.

To reduce their roster to 35 players, the Astros assigned Capel and seven others to the Toros prior to the <a href="1992%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1992 MLB season</a>. Capel was selected to the <a href="Triple-A%20All-Star%20Game">Triple-A All-Star Game</a> to replace <a href="Tim%20Scott%20%28baseball%29">Tim Scott</a>, whom the Padres promoted to MLB. He told Javier Morales of the "<a href="Arizona%20Daily%20Star">Arizona Daily Star</a>" that "this is one of the greatest thrills of my career", and he hoped it showed the Astros that he could pitch in MLB. <a href="Doug%20Jones%20%28baseball%29">Doug Jones</a> worked as Houston's closer in 1992, however, and Capel never played for the MLB club. For the Toros, Capel had a 6–6 record and a 2.19 ERA with a team-leading 18 saves. The following season, the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a> invited Capel to their spring camp as a non-roster invitee. Capel elected to remain with the Astros organization where he allowed 26 earned runs in 32.2 innings and pitched the entire season in Triple-A. The Toros, managed by <a href="Rick%20Sweet">Rick Sweet</a>, finished first in the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a> (PCL) South Division with an 83–60 record and made the playoffs. Unlike the 1993 MLB playoffs, in which four teams competed, only two teams could make the PCL playoffs. In the championship series, the Toros faced the <a href="Portland%20Beavers">Portland Beavers</a>, champions of the North Division and holders of a PCL-best 87–56 record. In a best-of-seven series, the Toros defeated the Beavers four games to two. After the season, the Astros did not re-sign Capel. While playing in MLB, Capel stood at and weighed .

In February 1986, Capel pitched in the University of Texas Alumni v. Varsity game, which ended in a 14–14 tie. Capel started to use <a href="dipping%20tobacco">dipping tobacco</a> in 1976 and in March 1988 had a non-cancerous lesion removed from his lip; he tried to quit the product in March 1988. Capel met his wife, Elizabeth, at Roger Clemens' wedding. Outside of baseball, he is a "close" friend of Clemens, and during Clemens' <a href="Roger%20Clemens%23Steroid%20use%20accusations">2012 perjury trial</a>, Capel testified on his work ethic and character. In 2012, Mike worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston.

Andjar Asmara

Abisin Abbas (; 26 February 1902 – 20 October 1961), better known by his pseudonym Andjar Asmara (), was a dramatist and filmmaker active in the cinema of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Born in <a href="Alahan%20Panjang">Alahan Panjang</a>, <a href="West%20Sumatra">West Sumatra</a>, he first worked as a reporter in <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> (modern-day Jakarta). He became a writer for the Padangsche Opera in <a href="Padang">Padang</a>, where he developed a new, dialogue-centric style, which later spread throughout the region. After returning to Batavia in 1929, he spent over a year as a theatre and film critic. In 1930 he joined the <a href="Dardanella%20%28theatre%20company%29">Dardanella touring troupe</a> as a writer. He went to India in an unsuccessful bid to film his <a href="stage%20play">stage play</a> "Dr Samsi".

After leaving Dardanella in 1936, Andjar established his own troupe. He also worked at a publishers, writing <a href="Serial%20%28literature%29">serials</a> based on successful films. In 1940 he was asked to join <a href="The%20Teng%20Chun">The Teng Chun</a>'s company, Java Industrial Film, helping with marketing and working as a director for two productions. After the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupation</a>, during which time he stayed in theatre, Andjar made a brief return to cinema. He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a>s, which were produced as films in the early 1950s. He published a novel, "Noesa Penida" (1950). Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism. Historians recognise him as a pioneer of theatre and one of the first <a href="native%20Indonesian">native Indonesian</a> film directors, although he had little creative control of his productions.
Andjar was born Abisin Abbas in <a href="Alahan%20Panjang">Alahan Panjang</a>, <a href="West%20Sumatra">West Sumatra</a>, on 26 February 1902. He gravitated toward traditional theatre at a young age after visits from the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera "stambul" troupes; he pretended to act with his friends in stage plays which they had seen. After completing his formal education up to the <a href="Meer%20Uitgebreid%20Lager%20Onderwijs">Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs</a> (junior high school) level – first in <a href="Malay-language">Malay-language</a> schools then Dutch ones – he moved to <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> (modern-day Jakarta). He worked as a reporter for two <a href="daily%20newspaper">daily newspaper</a>s, "Bintang Timoer" and "Bintang Hindia"; he may have also worked on a farm.

Around 1925, having had little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to <a href="Padang">Padang</a>, where he was a reporter for the <a href="Daily%20newspaper">daily</a> "Sinar Soematera". At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing <a href="stage%20play">stage play</a>s. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, "<a href="bangsawan">bangsawan</a>", he promoted a more natural style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; he referred to this as "toneel", based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of "Melati van Agam", a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and "<a href="Sitti%20Nurbaya">Sitti Nurbaya</a>", a 1922 novel by <a href="Marah%20Roesli">Marah Roesli</a>. These works were well received.
In the late 1920s, after spending some two years in <a href="Medan">Medan</a> with the daily "Sinar Soematra", Andjar returned to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine "Doenia Film", a Malay adaptation of the Dutch-language magazine "Filmland"; although an adaptation, "Doenia Film" also contained original coverage of the domestic theatre and film industry. At the time, the cinema of the Indies was becoming established: the first domestic film, "<a href="Loetoeng%20Kasaroeng">Loetoeng Kasaroeng</a>" ("The Lost Lutung"), was released in 1926, and four additional films were released in 1927 and 1928. Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical productions; for example, the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar inspired the marketing for 1929's "<a href="Njai%20Dasima%20%281929%20film%29">Njai Dasima</a>", which emphasised the exclusively <a href="native%20Indonesians">native</a> cast. In 1930 Andjar left "Doenia Film" and was replaced by <a href="Bachtiar%20Effendi">Bachtiar Effendi</a>.

Andjar became a writer for the theatrical troupe <a href="Dardanella%20%28theatre%20company%29">Dardanella</a> in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the "toneel" as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier "stambul" troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including "Dr Samsi" and "Singa Minangkabau" ("The Lion of Minangkabau"). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama "Dr Samsi", which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous <a href="Indo%20people">Indo</a> discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife <a href="Ratna%20Asmara">Ratna</a>.

Upon his return to the Indies, Andjar formed another theatrical troupe, Bolero, with Effendi, but left the troupe around 1940 to work at Kolf Publishers in <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>. Effendi was left as the head of Bolero, which then became more politicised. At Kolf Andjar edited the publisher's magazine "Poestaka Timoer". As his work entailed writing synopses and <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serials</a> based on popular films for Kolf's magazine, he became increasingly involved in the film industry. He was soon asked by <a href="The%20Teng%20Chun">The Teng Chun</a>, with whom he had maintained a business relationship, to direct a film for his company Java Industrial Film (JIF); with this Andjar became one of several noted theatrical personnel who migrated to film following <a href="Albert%20Balink">Albert Balink</a>'s 1937 hit "<a href="Terang%20Boelan">Terang Boelan</a>" ("Full Moon").

After handling the marketing for "<a href="Rentjong%20Atjeh">Rentjong Atjeh</a>" ("Rencong of Aceh", 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with "<a href="Kartinah">Kartinah</a>", a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. "<a href="Academia">Academia</a>" was critical of the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed "<a href="Noesa%20Penida">Noesa Penida</a>", a tragedy based in <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian <a href="Entertainment%20journalism">entertainment journalist</a> Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a>, who was generally also the producer.

During the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupation</a> from 1942 to 1945, the nation's film industry nearly ceased to exist: all but one studio were closed, and all films released were <a href="Japanese%20propaganda%20during%20World%20War%20II">propaganda</a> pieces to assist the Japanese war effort and promote the <a href="Greater%20East%20Asia%20Co-Prosperity%20Sphere">Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</a>. Andjar was not involved in these but was excited by the artistic merits of <a href="Japanese%20cinema">Japanese films</a>. Although he wrote several short stories during this time, three of which <a href="List%20of%20literary%20works%20published%20in%20Asia%20Raja">were published</a> in the pro-Japanese newspaper "<a href="Asia%20Raja">Asia Raja</a>" in 1942, Andjar focused on theatre, forming the troupe Tjahaya Timoer. He often visited the Cultural Centre (Keimin Bunka Sidosho) in Jakarta, where two employees, <a href="D.%20Djajakusuma">D. Djajakusuma</a> and <a href="Usmar%20Ismail">Usmar Ismail</a>, discussed filmmaking with him. Both became influential film directors during the 1950s.

After <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">Indonesia's independence</a>, Andjar moved to <a href="Purwokerto">Purwokerto</a> to lead the daily "Perdjoeangan Rakjat". After the paper collapsed, he returned to film, film a piece entitled "<a href="Djaoeh%20Dimata">Djaoeh Dimata</a>" for the <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20Civil%20Administration">Netherlands Indies Civil Administration</a> in 1948. This was followed by two additional films, "Anggrek Bulan" ("Moon Orchid"; 1948) and "<a href="Gadis%20Desa">Gadis Desa</a>" ("Maiden from the Village"; 1949), both based on plays he wrote several years earlier. In 1950, Andjar published his only novel, "Noesa Penida", a critique of the <a href="Balinese%20caste%20system">Balinese caste system</a>, which followed lovers from different levels of the social hierarchy. Meanwhile, he continued to write and publish <a href="paperback">paperback</a> serials adapted from local films.

Andjar's screenplay "Dr Samsi" was finally adapted as a film in 1952 by Ratna Asmara, who had become Indonesia's first female film director with her 1950 film "<a href="Sedap%20Malam">Sedap Malam</a>" ("Sweetness of the Night"). The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail. It would prove Andjar's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime. Although no longer writing films, Andjar remained active in the country's film industry. In 1955 he headed the inaugural <a href="Indonesian%20Film%20Festival">Indonesian Film Festival</a>, which was criticized when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films, Usmar Ismail's "<a href="Lewat%20Djam%20Malam">Lewat Djam Malam</a>" ("After the Curfew") and <a href="Lilik%20Sudjio">Lilik Sudjio</a>'s "<a href="Tarmina">Tarmina</a>". Critics wrote that "Lewat Djam Malam" was easily the stronger of the two and suggested that <a href="Djamaluddin%20Malik">Djamaluddin Malik</a>, "Tarmina" producer, had influenced the jury's decision.

In 1958 Asmara became the head of the entertainment magazine "Varia", where the fellow director <a href="Raden%20Ariffien">Raden Ariffien</a> served as his deputy. Asmara held the position until his death; among other roles, he wrote a series of memoires on the history of theatre in the country. He died on 20 October 1961 in Cipanas, <a href="West%20Java">West Java</a>, during a trip to <a href="Bandung">Bandung</a> and was buried in Jakarta.

Andjar's "toneels" were generally based on day-to-day experiences, rather than the tales of princes and ancient wars which were standard at the time. Regarding Andjar's "toneels", the Indonesian literary critic <a href="Bakri%20Siregar">Bakri Siregar</a> writes that Andjar's stage plays, as well as those of fellow dramatist <a href="Njoo%20Cheong%20Seng">Njoo Cheong Seng</a>, revitalised the genre and made the works more realistic. However, he considered the conflict in these works to have been poorly developed. Andjar believed that the Padangsche Opera's performances influenced other troupes in <a href="West%20Sumatra">West Sumatra</a> to adapt the "toneel" format, which later spread throughout the Indies.

Matthew Isaac Cohen, a scholar of Indonesian performing arts, describes Andjar as "Indonesia's foremost theater critic during the colonial period", noting that he wrote extensively on the history of theatre in the Indies. Cohen also believes that Andjar also worked to justify the "toneel" style and distance it from the earlier "stambul". Even after entering the film industry, Andjar considered the theatre more culturally significant than cinema. However, the Indonesian journalist Soebagijo I.N. writes that Andjar remains best known for his film work.

Andjar was one of the first native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar Effendi, Soeska, and <a href="Inoe%20Perbatasari">Inoe Perbatasari</a>. Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow the whims of the <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> film moguls, which resulted in the films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit. The film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, brought with them new ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.

Episode 14 (Twin Peaks)

"Episode 14", also known as "Lonely Souls", is the seventh episode of the <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20episodes%23Season%202%20%281990%E2%80%9391%29">second season</a> of the American mystery television series "<a href="Twin%20Peaks">Twin Peaks</a>". The episode was written by series co-creator <a href="Mark%20Frost">Mark Frost</a> and directed by series co-creator <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>. It features series regulars <a href="Kyle%20MacLachlan">Kyle MacLachlan</a>, <a href="Michael%20Ontkean">Michael Ontkean</a>, <a href="Ray%20Wise">Ray Wise</a> and <a href="Richard%20Beymer">Richard Beymer</a>; and guest stars <a href="Frank%20Silva">Frank Silva</a> (uncredited) as <a href="Killer%20BOB">Killer BOB</a>, <a href="Hank%20Worden">Hank Worden</a> as The Waiter, <a href="Julee%20Cruise">Julee Cruise</a> as Singer, and David Lynch as <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Gordon%20Cole">Gordon Cole</a>.

"Twin Peaks" centers on the investigation into the murder of schoolgirl <a href="Laura%20Palmer">Laura Palmer</a> (<a href="Sheryl%20Lee">Sheryl Lee</a>) in the small rural town in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington state</a> after which the series is named. In this episode, during the ongoing investigation into Laura's death, <a href="FBI">FBI</a> special agent <a href="Dale%20Cooper">Dale Cooper</a> (MacLachlan) and <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Harry%20Truman">Sheriff Truman</a> (Ontkean) continue to search for her killer, the demonic BOB, who has possessed a human host. Aided by <a href="MIKE%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Mike</a> (Al Strobel), Cooper and Truman arrest <a href="Benjamin%20Horne">Benjamin Horne</a> (Beymer), believing him to be inhabited by BOB. Later that night, Cooper is warned by <a href="The%20Giant%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">The Giant</a> (<a href="Carel%20Struycken">Carel Struycken</a>) that "it is happening again", while BOB's real host, Leland Palmer (Wise), murders <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Maddy%20Ferguson">Madeline Ferguson</a> (Lee).

"Episode 14" was first broadcast on November 10, 1990, on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC) and was watched by an audience of 17.2 million households in the United States, about 20 percent of the available audience. The episode was well received, garnering positive reviews after its initial broadcast and in subsequent years, but it has been criticized for unduly prolonging the revelation of Laura's killer. Academic readings of the entry have highlighted the theme of duality and the cinematography in the revelation scene.

The small fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl <a href="Laura%20Palmer">Laura Palmer</a> (<a href="Sheryl%20Lee">Sheryl Lee</a>) and the attempted murder of her friend <a href="List%20of%20characters%20in%20Twin%20Peaks%23Ronette%20Pulaski">Ronette Pulaski</a> (Phoebe Augustine). <a href="FBI">FBI</a> special agent <a href="Dale%20Cooper">Dale Cooper</a> (<a href="Kyle%20MacLachlan">Kyle MacLachlan</a>) has been sent to the town to investigate, and has come to the realization that the killer was possessed by a demonic entity—<a href="Killer%20BOB">Killer BOB</a> (<a href="Frank%20Silva">Frank Silva</a>). <a href="MIKE%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">MIKE</a> (Al Strobel), a similar spirit, has spoken to Cooper and his FBI superior, Regional Bureau Chief <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Gordon%20Cole">Gordon Cole</a> (<a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>), explaining the nature of their existence.

Meanwhile, <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Maddy%20Ferguson">Madeline "Maddy" Ferguson</a> (Lee), Laura's cousin, has arrived in Twin Peaks from <a href="Missoula%2C%20Montana">Missoula, Montana</a>, and helps Laura's friends <a href="Donna%20Hayward">Donna Hayward</a> (<a href="Lara%20Flynn%20Boyle">Lara Flynn Boyle</a>) and <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23James%20Hurley">James Hurley</a> (<a href="James%20Marshall%20%28actor%29">James Marshall</a>) investigate the killing. Donna finds <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Harold%20Smith">Harold Smith</a> (<a href="Lenny%20Von%20Dohlen">Lenny Von Dohlen</a>), one of Laura's friends to whom she had given a secret diary, and Donna and Maddy attempt to steal it from him.

It is morning at the Sheriff's Station. Agent Cooper, Chief Gordon Cole, <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Harry%20Truman">Sheriff Harry S. Truman</a> (<a href="Michael%20Ontkean">Michael Ontkean</a>), <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Andy%20Brennan">Deputy Andy Brennan</a> (<a href="Harry%20Goaz">Harry Goaz</a>), <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Deputy%20Tommy%20%26quot%3BHawk%26quot%3B%20Hill">Deputy Hawk</a> (<a href="Michael%20Horse">Michael Horse</a>), and <a href="MIKE">Phillip Gerard</a> (<a href="Al%20Strobel">Al Strobel</a>) are drinking coffee in the lobby. Truman informs that preparations have been made for them at The Great Northern. Gerard, currently possessed by MIKE, mutters his description of Bob's current location. Truman tells Hawk to search Harold Smith's apartment. Cooper tells Hawk to search for Laura Palmer's secret diary. Cole bids all farewell and leaves for Bend, Oregon.

Cooper, <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Will%20Hayward">Doctor Hayward</a> (<a href="Warren%20Frost">Warren Frost</a>), Brennan, and Gerard / MIKE are in the lobby of The Great Northern Hotel attempting to find BOB's human host. The hotel is hosting a contingent of sailors who are bouncing rubber balls in the hotel lobby. MIKE is seated while hotel guests are brought to him one by one for "inspection." One after another, MIKE turns each away. An angry <a href="Ben%20Horne">Benjamin Horne</a> (<a href="Richard%20Beymer">Richard Beymer</a>) enters the lobby demanding to know what is going on. Just then, Gerard enters a fit and collapses while grasping at his missing arm.

Meanwhile, Deputy Hawk visits the residence of Harold Smith and finds him hanging dead amongst his orchids. Maddy announces to her Uncle <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Leland%20Palmer">Leland</a> (<a href="Ray%20Wise">Ray Wise</a>) and Aunt <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Sarah%20Palmer">Sarah</a> (<a href="Grace%20Zabriskie">Grace Zabriskie</a>) that she is leaving Twin Peaks to return to her home in Missoula, Montana. Cooper, Truman, and a police team arrive at Smith's residence. They discover the torn-up remains of Laura Palmer's secret diary strewn about, and a suicide note that reads, "J'ai une âme solitaire." Cooper translates, "I am a lonely soul."

Elsewhere, <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Bobby%20Briggs">Bobby Briggs</a> (<a href="Dana%20Ashbrook">Dana Ashbrook</a>) and <a href="Shelly%20Johnson%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Shelly Johnson</a> (<a href="M%C3%A4dchen%20Amick">Mädchen Amick</a>) discuss their financial concerns regarding Shelly's <a href="Catatonia">catatonic</a> husband <a href="Leo%20Johnson%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Leo</a> (<a href="Eric%20Da%20Re">Eric Da Re</a>). <a href="Audrey%20Horne">Audrey Horne</a> (<a href="Sherilyn%20Fenn">Sherilyn Fenn</a>) confronts her father Ben over his ownership of the brothel <a href="One%20Eyed%20Jacks%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">One Eyed Jacks</a>. He confesses that he and Laura Palmer had a sexual relationship. When Audrey asks him if he killed her, he replies "I loved her." Later, Shelly arrives for work at the Double R Diner and tearfully informs <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Norma%20Jennings">Norma Jennings</a> (<a href="Peggy%20Lipton">Peggy Lipton</a>) that she has to quit the diner to care for Leo full-time. <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Ed%20Hurley">Ed Hurley</a> (<a href="Everett%20McGill">Everett McGill</a>) and his wife <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Nadine%20Hurley">Nadine</a> (<a href="Wendy%20Robie">Wendy Robie</a>) enter the diner. Nadine, believing she is an eighteen-year old high school student, asks Norma about her relationship with Ed, to their embarrassment. Nadine then accidentally shatters her milkshake glass. At the Johnson residence, Bobby Briggs and <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Mike%20Nelson">Mike Nelson</a> (Gary Hershberger) break open the heel of Leo Johnson's boot, discovering a <a href="microcassette">microcassette</a> hidden within.

Cooper examines the remains of Laura's secret diary at the police station, finding repeated references to BOB, and a description of sexual abuse since childhood. Laura wrote that BOB was a friend of her father, and in another entry wrote, "Someday I'm going to tell the world about Ben Horne." Audrey then enters and tells Cooper about Ben and Laura's affair. After she leaves, Cooper reminds Sheriff Truman of <a href="The%20Giant%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">The Giant</a>'s message, "Without chemicals, he points". Cooper states that MIKE manifests when his human host, Philip Gerard, is not medicated, and that MIKE fainted that morning just as a certain person approached him. Cooper exclaims to Truman, "Harry, we need a warrant...a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Horne!"

Later that evening, Benjamin Horne is meeting with Mr. Tojamura at The Great Northern. Mr. Tojamura gives Horne a check for $5 million to purchase the lands of the Packard Sawmill. Immediately after accepting the check, Sheriff Truman, Deputy Hawk, and Agent Cooper enter Horne's office. Truman arrests Horne for murder. Horne attempts to flee but is restrained and handcuffed. At the Palmer home, a severely impaired <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Sarah%20Palmer">Sarah Palmer</a> crawls down the stairs, crying to Leland for help. A phonograph is spinning in the background, its needle skipping at the end of the record.

After jailing Horne at the Sheriff's Station, Cooper and Truman encounter the <a href="Log%20Lady">Log Lady</a> (<a href="Catherine%20E.%20Coulson">Catherine E. Coulson</a>), who tells Cooper, "...there are owls in The Roadhouse." Cooper replies, "Something is happening, isn't it, Margaret?" The moon is full, partially obscured by a dark and cloudy sky.

At the Packard residence, <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Pete%20Martell">Pete Martell</a> (<a href="Jack%20Nance">Jack Nance</a>) is fixing himself a midnight snack. He encounters Mr. Tojamura in the dark, who roughly embraces and kisses him, causing Pete to drop and shatter his plate. In a high dudgeon, Pete orders Tojamura to leave. Tojamura coyly reveals that he is actually <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Catherine%20Martell">Catherine Martell</a> (<a href="Piper%20Laurie">Piper Laurie</a>) in disguise. The two embrace as Pete emotionally dissolves.

Sarah Palmer crawls into her living room. She sees a vision of a pale white horse then passes out. Leland Palmer is fixing his tie in the mirror, ignoring her.

Cooper, Truman, and The Log Lady visit The Roadhouse, which is filled with sailors. <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23Donna%20Hayward">Donna Hayward</a> (<a href="Lara%20Flynn%20Boyle">Lara Flynn Boyle</a>) and <a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20characters%23James%20Hurley">James Hurley</a> (<a href="James%20Marshall%20%28actor%29">James Marshall</a>) are seated together discussing Harold's death and Maddy's departure from Twin Peaks. Bobby Briggs is seated at the bar next to the old waiter (<a href="Hank%20Worden">Hank Worden</a>) from The Great Northern. While a <a href="Julee%20Cruise">singer</a> and band perform, Cooper has a vision of The Giant standing alone on stage. The Giant says to Cooper, "It is happening again." He repeats this warning.

At the Palmer home, Leland smiles at himself in the mirror. BOB stares back at him from the reflection and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her "Laura," while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words "Missoula, Montana" in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter "O" under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.

Cooper's vision of The Giant ends, replaced by the singer and band. The old waiter walks over to Cooper and says, "I'm so sorry." Donna begins to sob. James comforts her, to no avail. Bobby Briggs turns from the bar, overcome by sadness as well. Cooper stares out, bewildered, as the band repeats a melancholy refrain.

"Episode 14" was written by series co-creator <a href="Mark%20Frost">Mark Frost</a>, who had written six previous episodes and directed the first-season finale, "<a href="Episode%207%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Episode 7</a>". Frost co-wrote three further installments—"<a href="Episode%2016%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Episode 16</a>", "<a href="List%20of%20Twin%20Peaks%20episodes%23ep27">Episode 26</a>" and <a href="Episode%2029%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Episode 29</a>"— and all of the episodes of the <a href="Twin%20Peaks%20%282017%20TV%20series%29">2017 limited series</a>. This episode was directed by Lynch, the fifth such episode of "Twin Peaks"; he later directed "<a href="Episode%2029%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Episode 29</a>", the series' finale, and all of the installments of the limited series. It was rated <a href="TV-14">TV-14</a> in the United States during initial rebroadcasts; it was later re-rated to <a href="TV-PG">TV-PG</a>. Lynch has later stated that he feels he was able to show more on screen in the episode than he expected the network's standards and practicies office to allow. He credits this to the unusual imagery used, adding "if it's not quite standard it sneaks through, but it could be that the 'not quite standard' things make it even more terrifying and disturbing".

The cast of "Twin Peaks" did not know who would be revealed as Palmer's killer for some time. Wise had hoped his character Leland would not be the eventual murderer; as the parent of a young girl he was disturbed by the idea of portraying a man who had murdered his daughter. Wise was called to a meeting with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, during which Lynch told those assembled that Leland Palmer was the killer: while addressing Wise, Lynch said "Ray, it was you, it was always you". However, Wise felt that the end result was "beautiful", and that it left him and his character "satisfied and redeemed". Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter <a href="Jennifer%20Lynch">Jennifer</a>, who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie-in novel "<a href="The%20Secret%20Diary%20of%20Laura%20Palmer">The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer</a>".

Lynch has mentioned that he tried to avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series "<a href="The%20Fugitive%20%28TV%20series%29">The Fugitive</a>", which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated "each week, you know, they [the writers for "The Fugitive"] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".

The climactic murder of Madeline Ferguson in the episode features extensive use of <a href="jump%20cut">jump cut</a>s to portray Leland Palmer's <a href="spirit%20possession">spirit possession</a>, switching rapidly between actors Ray Wise and Frank Silva. The scene is unusually long for a murder on television, lasting over four minutes. Some of its elements, including the insertion of a paper letter under Ferguson's fingernail and the use of jump cuts to events in the Roadhouse bar, are intended to echo similar aspects of "<a href="Pilot%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Pilot</a>".

Erica Sheen and Annette Davison, in their book "The Cinema of David Lynch: American Dreams, Nightmare Visions", have drawn attention to the use of <a href="mise%20en%20sc%C3%A8ne">mise en scène</a> early in the episode. A scene featuring Ferguson, Leland and Sarah Palmer sitting in the Palmers' living room pans across the family's "bric-à-brac". This technique draws attention to the painting with which Ferguson will be assaulted, and it highlights the similarity between Ferguson and Palmer by focusing on "the famous homecoming queen shot" of Palmer while Ferguson's face is visible. Sheen and Davison argued that the scene highlights the "emotional claustrophobia" felt by Ferguson, and that the set surrounding her was deliberately assembled to create this feeling.

The revelation scene, in which Bob is shown to have inhabited Leland Palmer, has been noted for its sense of duality, a common theme throughout "Twin Peaks". In "Full of Secrets: Critical Approaches to Twin Peaks", David Lavery wrote that upon The Giant's appearance to Dale Cooper, "The Giant has transmuted the public place into something private". Lavery added that the murder scene is "in the living room, the public within the private". He summarized that the ambiguity between the public perception and the private perception—"the outer and the inner"—"reverberates" throughout the scene. In his view, Maddy Ferguson was Laura Palmer's "double" and Leland is "doubled" by Bob. However, Lavery referred to the duality of Leland and Bob as a "subjective formation" and added that the use of jump cuts "could be Maddy's view of Leland just as much as Leland's view of himself".

This scene has also been noted by critic Sue Lafky from the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Film%20and%20Video">Journal of Film and Video</a>" as one of several in the series that suggest incest and <a href="necrophilia">necrophilia</a>. She speculated that "Leland/Bob may have raped the dead or dying Maddie", comparing this to the "necrophilic fantasies" that Laura Palmer's corpse evokes, and Ben Horne's unwitting brush with incest when he encounters his daughter Audrey at a brothel. Earlier in the episode it is revealed that Laura had been subject to sexual abuse by BOB, and implicitly Leland, which was further explored in the 1992 prequel film, "".

"Episode 14" first aired on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> network on November 10, 1990. The initial broadcast was viewed by 17.2 million households in the United States, making it the fifty-first most-viewed broadcast episode for the week. These viewing figures represented 20 percent of the available audience and 10.4 percent of all households in the country. This represented a significant rise in viewing figures compared to the preceding episode, "Episode 13", which was seen by 11.3 million households. However, the following episode, "Episode 15", suffered a drop in viewing figures, attracting 13.3 million households.

The episode was well received critically. Writing for the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", <a href="Richard%20Roeper">Richard Roeper</a> noted that fans and critics had begun to lose interest in the series by this point, but felt that "even at its most strained and obtuse, ["Twin Peaks"] displays more imagination and effort than almost everything else in TV land". He added that viewers may have been put off by the series' frame of time, explaining that only two weeks of narrative time had elapsed since "Pilot", a slow pace contrasted with the "fast-forward, instant payoff philosophy of most television". <a href="AllRovi">AllRovi</a>'s Andrea LeVasseur described the installment as "pivotal", noting that it "answers some of the series' long-running questions".

Writing for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", Keith Phipps rated the episode an "A", adding "it's not like there's any shortage of action". He felt that the effects used in the episode were effective and frightening while still seeming low-key. In his view, the episode's blending of surrealism and horror was similar to scenes from Lynch's 2001 film "<a href="Mulholland%20Drive%20%28film%29">Mulholland Drive</a>". Phipps described the climactic murder as "one of the most disturbing moments in the Lynch filmography", adding that it was a recurring Lynchian theme to represent the end of innocence as an actual death. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Matt Fowler included the murder at number 16 in a list of the "Top 20 Creepiest Moments on TV", describing it as "nightmare fuel". Fowler felt the depiction of the killing was "savage" and unusually long for a television scene; however, he added that the rampant speculation as to the identity of the killer meant that whoever it was revealed to have been, it would be "somewhat expected".

Keith Uhlich, writing for "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>", described the episode as "quintessential Lynch, perhaps his finest work", noting that the climactic murder scene was more powerful because of its necessary use of implication and suggestion. However, Uhlich felt that the installment was "a tough act to follow", arguing that the only subsequent installments that competed with it were the series' finale and the 1992 <a href="psychological%20thriller">psychological thriller</a> film "", which is based on "Twin Peaks". <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a>'s Jamie S. Rich described the installment as "a violent, disturbing revelation". Rich felt that the entry's supernatural elements assured the audience that there was "a grander scheme to the Laura Palmer story", elevating the series' long-running murder plot beyond "just a random night partying with drug dealers gone wrong".

Terang Boelan

Terang Boelan (; <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian</a> for "Full Moon", "Terang Bulan" in the <a href="Perfected%20Spelling%20System">Perfected Spelling System</a>) is a 1937 film from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (now Indonesia). Written by <a href="Saeroen">Saeroen</a>, directed by <a href="Albert%20Balink">Albert Balink</a>, and starring <a href="Rd%20Mochtar">Rd Mochtar</a>, <a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a> and Eddie T. Effendi, "Terang Boelan" follows two lovers who elope after one is almost forced to marry an <a href="opium">opium</a> smuggler. The film was shot in the Indies and Singapore, and was partially inspired by the 1936 Hollywood film "<a href="The%20Jungle%20Princess">The Jungle Princess</a>". It was aimed at <a href="native%20Indonesians">native</a> audiences and included "<a href="keroncong">keroncong</a>" music, which was popular at the time, and several actors from Balink's previous work "<a href="Pareh">Pareh</a>" (1936).

"Terang Boelan" was a commercial success in both the Indies and abroad, earning 200,000 <a href="Straits%20dollar">Straits dollar</a>s in <a href="British%20Malaya">British Malaya</a>. This success revived the faltering domestic film industry and inspired films aimed at <a href="Malay%20people">Malay</a> audiences in Malaya, creating a formula of songs, beautiful scenery and romance that was followed for decades afterwards. The Indonesian film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> described it as a turning point in the history of Indonesian cinema for its catalytic effect on the industry's growth. Like many Indonesian films of the era, "Terang Boelan" has been <a href="lost%20film">lost</a> since at least the 1970s.

Rohaya (<a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a>) must separate from her lover, Kasim (<a href="Rd%20Mochtar">Rd Mochtar</a>), so that she can marry her father's choice, the disreputable but rich Musa (Eddie T. Effendi). The night before the wedding, Kasim plays the song "<a href="Terang%20Bulan">Terang Boelan</a>" for Rohaya, and they agree to <a href="elope">elope</a>. The following day, Rohaya and Kasim escape from Sawoba Island to <a href="Malacca">Malacca</a>, where Kasim begins work at a <a href="drydock">drydock</a> and Rohaya keeps busy as a housewife. They discover that Kasim's old friend, Dullah (<a href="Kartolo">Kartolo</a>), has lived in Malacca for some time.

Their life together is interrupted when Musa, who is revealed to be an opium dealer, discovers them. While Kasim is away at work, Rohaya's father (Muhin) comes and takes her back to Sawoba. Kasim, having discovered Musa's deeds, also returns to Sawoba and rallies the villagers to his side by telling them of Musa's opium dealings. He and Musa begin fighting. When it appears Kasim may lose, he is saved by Dullah, who had followed him back to Sawoba. The villagers and Rohaya's father agree that Kasim and Rohaya should be together, as they are truly in love.

During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> had been made by the American-educated <a href="Chinese-Indonesian">Chinese-Indonesian</a> director <a href="The%20Teng%20Chun">The Teng Chun</a>. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by <a href="Chinese%20mythology">Chinese mythology</a> or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among <a href="Native%20Indonesians">native audiences</a> because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that there was a very low <a href="profit%20margin">profit margin</a> for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.

In an attempt to show that locally produced, well-made films could be profitable, the Dutch journalist <a href="Albert%20Balink">Albert Balink</a>, who had no formal film experience, produced "<a href="Pareh">Pareh</a>" ("Rice") in 1935 in collaboration with the ethnic Chinese <a href="Wong%20brothers">Wong brothers</a> (Othniel and Joshua), and the Dutch documentary filmmaker <a href="Mannus%20Franken">Mannus Franken</a>. The film cost 20 times as much as an average local production, in part because of Balink's perfectionism, and was ultimately a failure. The Indonesian writer and cultural critic <a href="Armijn%20Pane">Armijn Pane</a> wrote that "Pareh" had performed poorly with native audiences as it was seen as looking at them through European eyes. "Pareh" bankrupted its producers, and enabled The Teng Chun to dominate the industry – although with less traditional stories – for a further two years.

By late 1936 Balink had obtained financial backing from several domestic and foreign companies with which he, the Wongs, and Franken opened the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (, or ANIF) in <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> (now Jakarta). Although this new establishment focused mainly on <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a>s and documentaries, on 1 January 1937 ANIF announced that it would produce several <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a>s, one of which was "Terang Boelan".

The story for "Terang Boelan" was written by <a href="Saeroen">Saeroen</a>, a reporter with the newspaper "Pemandangan" who had close connections to the theatrical community, shortly after the domestic release of the American-produced <a href="Dorothy%20Lamour">Dorothy Lamour</a> vehicle "<a href="The%20Jungle%20Princess">The Jungle Princess</a>" (1936), which served as an inspiration. The Indonesian film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> wrote that this gave "Terang Boelan" stylistic and thematic similarities to the earlier film. The Indonesian film critic Salim Said also recognised such similarities, describing "Terang Boelan" as reflecting the "jungle princess" works popular at the time. Saeroen named the fictional island on which "Terang Boelan" takes place "Sawoba" after the crew: Saeroen, Wong, and Balink.

Production had begun by February 1937, under Balink's direction and with the Wongs as cinematographers, only to be interrupted by the relocation of ANIF's offices. Filming had begun by May of that year. Sources conflict as to whether Franken was involved: Biran wrote that Franken had been left in charge of the studio's documentaries, while the American film scholar <a href="Karl%20G.%20Heider">Karl G. Heider</a> recorded Franken as co-directing the film. As opposed to The Teng Chun, who aimed his films at lower-class audiences, Balink aimed his film at educated native Indonesians, attempting to show them not from a European perspective but as they viewed themselves. According to Said, this arose as a reaction to failure and resulted in a less <a href="ethnological">ethnological</a> approach. "Terang Boelan" was shot in black-and-white using highly flammable <a href="nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a> at <a href="Cilincing">Cilincing</a> in Batavia, Merak Beach in <a href="Banten">Banten</a>, and <a href="Tanjong%20Katong">Tanjong Katong</a> in Singapore. The use of nitrate film may have been a factor in the film's later loss.

The cast of "Terang Boelan" mainly consisted of actors who had appeared in "Pareh". This included the <a href="leading%20actor">leading actor</a>, Rd Mochtar, and several minor players, including Eddie T. Effendi and Soekarsih. Other cast members, including the <a href="leading%20lady">leading lady</a> Roekiah and her husband Kartolo, were drawn from traditional "toneel" theatrical troupes; this may have been part of an effort to attract theatregoers. The film, which included the songs "Terang Boelan" and "Boenga Mawar" ("Rose"), required its cast to sing "<a href="keroncong">keroncong</a>" music (traditional music with <a href="Portuguese%20colonialism%20in%20Indonesia">Portuguese</a> influences); because Mochtar's voice was ill-suited to the task, the musician <a href="Ismail%20Marzuki">Ismail Marzuki</a> – who also composed the film's score – sang while Mochtar <a href="lip%20sync">lip sync</a>ed.

"Terang Boelan" premiered on 8 December 1937 at the Rex Theatre in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies; it played to a nearly full theatre. Also marketed under the Dutch title "Het Eilan der Droomen", the film was advertised as showing that the Indies were as beautiful as <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, a popular island paradise in Hollywood films. Posters also emphasised the use of Indonesian-language dialogue. William van der Heide, a lecturer on film studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Newcastle%20%28Australia%29">University of Newcastle</a> in Australia, notes that the film continued a trend of "Indonesianisation", or the application of a national (Indonesian) understanding to borrowed concepts; for "Terang Boelan" this indigenisation process involved the inclusion of "exotic local settings" and "keroncong" music. Such adaptations of foreign films had arisen several years earlier and continued long after "Terang Boelan" release.

The film was a commercial success, both in the Indies and nearby <a href="British%20Malaya">British Malaya</a>. Native audiences filled the cinemas, most of them working-class people, including native fans of "toneel" and "keroncong" who rarely watched films. After being licensed by <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Radio Pictures</a>, the film was screened in British Malaya, where it was advertised as "the first and best Malay musical" and earned 200,000 <a href="Straits%20dollar">Straits dollar</a>s (then equivalent to <a href="US%24">US$</a> 114,470) in two months. "Terang Boelan" proved to be the most successful production in the area until "Krisis" ("Crisis") in 1953, released after the Netherlands recognised Indonesia's independence in 1949.

Despite the success, ANIF was displeased with the film and halted its other non-documentary productions; one of the studio's cameramen, an <a href="Indo%20people">Indo</a> man named J.J.W. Steffens, suggested that ANIF's management preferred works of non-fiction as a more intellectual medium. Disappointed by the company's reaction, Balink left the Indies and emigrated to the United States in March 1938. "Terang Boelan" cast left ANIF not long afterwards and, after briefly touring Malaya, joined <a href="Tan%27s%20Film">Tan's Film</a>. They made their first film for Tan's, "<a href="Fatima%20%281938%20film%29">Fatima</a>", in 1938. Mochtar, who soon married fellow "Terang Boelan" actress Soekarsih, continued to be cast as Roekiah's lover; the two were a popular screen couple until Mochtar left Tan's in 1940 over a wage dispute.

The success of "Terang Boelan" led to an increase in film production in the colony, many of the films following the same formula, including songs, beautiful scenery and romance. Before "Terang Boelan", local studios had generally been unsuccessful in finding a formula popular with audiences, but the triple successes of "Terang Boelan", "Fatima", and "<a href="Alang-Alang%20%28film%29">Alang-Alang</a>" ("Grass", 1939) revived the industry. Four new <a href="production%20house">production house</a>s were established in 1940, and actors and actresses previously attached to theatrical troupes entered the film industry, which was reaching new audiences. Most locally produced <a href="List%20of%20films%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">films released in the Indies</a> were made between 1939 and the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupation</a> in 1942. Meanwhile, in Malaya, the brothers <a href="Run%20Run%20Shaw">Run Run</a> and <a href="Runme%20Shaw">Runme Shaw</a>, drawing inspiration from "Terang Boelan" and "Alang-Alang" success with <a href="Ethnic%20Malays">Malay audiences</a>, established Malay Film Productions in Singapore, where it became one of the more successful production houses.

Heider considered "Terang Boelan" one of the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's earlier film "Pareh" was the other. He notes that "Terang Boelan" "set the tone for popular Indonesian cinema", a tone that remained dominant into the 1990s. Biran considered the film a turning point in the history of <a href="Indonesian%20cinema">Indonesian cinema</a>, showing the possibilities of the medium and serving as a catalyst for further development. Said concurred, describing the film as a milestone in Indonesia's history because of the widespread formula it introduced. The repeated use of "Terang Boelan" formula has been criticised. The director <a href="Teguh%20Karya">Teguh Karya</a>, for instance, denounced films that used it without building on it, leaving the formula "undeveloped and static".

"Terang Boelan" is considered <a href="Lost%20film">lost</a>, as are most domestic productions from the era. The Filipino film historian and director <a href="Nick%20Deocampo">Nick Deocampo</a> noted that productions made with nitrate film – such as "Terang Boelan" – burned easily and were thus easily lost, but suggested that copies of the film may have survived until the 1970s. In a 1991 publication Said, Heider, and the American translator <a href="John%20H.%20McGlynn">John H. McGlynn</a> expressed hope that a copy of the film might be lying around in someone's attic or closet in Indonesia or the Netherlands.

Frank's Cock

Frank's Cock is a 1993 Canadian <a href="short%20film">short film</a> written and directed by <a href="Mike%20Hoolboom">Mike Hoolboom</a>. The eight-minute production stars <a href="Callum%20Keith%20Rennie">Callum Keith Rennie</a> as an unnamed narrator who discusses his relationship with his partner, Frank. The two met while the narrator was a teenager and spent nearly ten years together. Frank has since been diagnosed with <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a>, and the narrator fears his death. The story was based on the experience of one of Hoolboom's friends at <a href="People%20With%20AIDS">People With AIDS</a>, which Hoolboom adapted after receiving a commission to create a short film about <a href="breakup">breaking up</a>.

Shot on a low budget, the work is shown in a split-screen format with interspersed scenes from popular culture, <a href="gay%20pornography">gay pornography</a>, and <a href="Human%20embryogenesis">human embryo formation</a>; this format is meant to symbolise the "fragmentation of the body" experienced by AIDS sufferers. Produced by Alex Mackenzie, "Frank's Cock" was critically acclaimed and won several awards, including the NFB–John Spotton Award for best Canadian short film at the <a href="1994%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">1994 Toronto International Film Festival</a>. The script has been republished several times and has inspired a short on <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> issues in Canada's <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">native community</a>.

An unnamed narrator (<a href="Callum%20Keith%20Rennie">Callum Keith Rennie</a>), who as a teenager intended to be the "<a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> of sex" or "<a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> with a hard-on", discusses how he met and fell in love with an older man named Frank. After the two met at a <a href="group%20sex">group sex</a> session, they began an older brother–younger brother fantasy and moved in together. Frank has a voracious sexual appetite and, at times, invites the narrator for whole-day sex sessions. He is a tender lover, teaching his partner how to fly a <a href="box%20kite">box kite</a> and cooking <a href="omelette">omelette</a>s for him. The narrator is pleased with Frank's attentions and their sexual experimentation, although he is initially confused by Frank's insistence on listening to <a href="Peter%20Gzowski">Peter Gzowski</a>'s "<a href="Morningside%20%28radio%20program%29">Morningside</a>" during sex. As their ten-year anniversary approaches, Frank – having lost much weight and developed <a href="Kaposi%27s%20sarcoma">Kaposi's sarcoma</a>s – has been diagnosed with <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a>, leaving the narrator stunned; he concludes the narration with "I'm going to miss him. He was the best friend I ever had."

The Canadian director <a href="Mike%20Hoolboom">Mike Hoolboom</a> was diagnosed with <a href="HIV">HIV</a> in 1988 or 1989, after going to donate blood. In a 1993 interview, he stated that he felt himself working harder after the diagnosis, finishing films at a more rapid rate because he was uncertain how long he would live. Hoolboom also became "fascinated with a body of parts spliced and spliced again", experimenting with "interruptive rhythms" as a way to reexamine simple acts. Having previously focused on films about the body, Hoolboom began dealing heavily with fragmentation, HIV/AIDS, and situations faced by those with the virus; "Frank's Cock" was his first venture directly addressing the AIDS issue.

While living in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, Hoolboom joined the local <a href="People%20With%20AIDS">People With AIDS</a> (PWA) group. There he befriended a man (Joey in some sources, Alan in others) whose partner was dying of AIDS. Upon his friend's suggestion, Hoolboom began work on a script for "a real movie": one which portrayed an AIDS patient as full of love, not one that showed the patient's friends abandoning him. The friend was, however, unwilling to appear in the film. In writing the script Hoolboom tried to keep elements of humour; he later said that the humour was necessary as the source had insisted "most of our relationship was incredibly joyous and happy and a good time".

After receiving a commission to make a short film for the Vancouver-based cooperative Cineworks, Hoolboom began working on realising the script with a low budget and limited amount of <a href="16%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20film">16 mm film</a> from the <a href="National%20Film%20Board%20of%20Canada">National Film Board of Canada</a>; he was one of seven artists commissioned to "spark local production" with short films on <a href="breakup">breakup</a>, which were ultimately included in the omnibus "Breaking Up". Rennie – at that time a relative unknown – agreed to deliver the monologue. Hoolboom was pleased with the results, writing that Rennie presented the monologue as if "he'd been living this story all along." The majority of the technical work, including direction, cinematography, and editing, was handled by Hoolboom; Alex Mackenzie, working for Cineworks, produced the film.

Part of the terms of his grant were that Hoolboom was allowed a limited number of <a href="Film%20editing">edit</a>s (one or three). After pondering how to complete the film under such terms, Hoolboom chose to use no edits. He recorded previously edited footage, some appropriated from various sources, through a hole in a piece of cardboard, producing a single quadrant; he repeated this process three times, using the same film, which resulted in four quadrants with four different images. Production was completed by early 1993, and in screenings "Frank's Cock" was marketed as an "extremely explicit" <a href="experimental%20film">experimental film</a>.

Although societal awareness of AIDS had developed at a slower pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, <a href="Nik%20Sheehan">Nik Sheehan</a>'s "No Sad Songs" and <a href="John%20Erman">John Erman</a>'s "<a href="An%20Early%20Frost">An Early Frost</a>" respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made "Frank's Cock"; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.

"Frank's Cock" divides the screen into quadrants, with the majority of the film focusing on the upper-right corner of the screen. In this panel, Rennie's character gives a monologue, which is sometimes illustrated by images in other panels: the lower-right panel flashes scenes of hardcore <a href="gay%20pornography">gay pornography</a>, the upper-left shows scenes representing <a href="Human%20embryogenesis">human embryo formation</a>, while the lower-left flashes excerpts from popular art. Aside from the original footage of Rennie, the short appropriated clips from the "<a href="Nova%20%28TV%20series%29">Nova</a>" episode "<a href="The%20Miracle%20of%20Life">The Miracle of Life</a>", the gay pornographic film "The Best of Blondes", and the <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>'s 1992 song "<a href="Erotica%20%28song%29">Erotica</a>". The effect was later reused in Hoolboom's 1997 short "Positiv".

Janis Cole, writing for "POV" magazine, described the split-screen effect as supporting the text while "creating an optical treatment purposefully grounded in both dream and reality", as elements show out of sync. Jeff Rush and Cynthia Baughman, writing in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Film%20and%20Video">Journal of Film and Video</a>", described the film as showing that "text can reverse the traditional balance of words = abstractions/images = the concrete" through the creation of vivid, perhaps disturbing, word pictures which serve as tangible images contrasted with the faint abstractions which are the actual images. Jack Rusholme, prefacing a retrospective of Hoolboom's works by Experimenta Media Arts, wrote that the split-screen evokes the effects of AIDS, in which "the body [is] broken into dispersed vantages", while the narration serves to "bind with words what this disease will render lifeless and inert". In a 1994 interview, Hoolboom stated that his intent was to represent the "fragmentation of the body" experienced by AIDS sufferers.

"Frank's Cock" has received warm critical reviews, both in Canada and abroad. Cole called it an "extraordinary experimental documentary" that is "as bold as the title implies" and a strong argument for the widespread dissemination of short films. Waugh placed "Frank's Cock" as one of a "great AIDS triptych", together with Hoolboom's later works "<a href="Letters%20from%20Home%20%28film%29">Letters from Home</a>" (1996) and "Positiv". The Canadian film scholar Darell Varga wrote that the film is an "emotionally riveting" eulogy to the loss of love. Karen Tisch, writing in "Take One", found that the short built its emotional power "delicately but steadily"; she suggested that its <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a> (TIFF) win was well-deserved.

Reviewing for the <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>n independent film magazine "In the Picture", James Twentyman wrote that the film was "relatively straightforward" but strong and provocative, emphasising the "soul-baring" nature of the monologue. Rush and Baughman found that the short took the narrative voice beyond what is mainstream, demonstrating "the power of word and image", while Rusholme described "Frank's Cock" as Hoolboom's "most explicit AIDS narrative". The Swiss film festival Viper touted the short as expressing humour and <a href="sexual%20obsession">sexual obsession</a> in the face of a plague.

Hoolboom has stated that he felt the film was accessible to both gay or straight audiences, which should "open them up to differences of form and why [one] would make something formally different." Waugh suggested that this was successful, as in his experience audiences often cried at screenings.

"Frank's Cock" won several awards at domestic and international film festivals. At the <a href="1994%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">1994 TIFF</a> it won the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival%20Award%20for%20Best%20Canadian%20Short%20Film">NFB–John Spotton Award</a>, given for the best Canadian short film. The jury cited "Frank's Cock" for its "evocative images, ... impeccable writing and "<a href="mise-en-sc%C3%A8ne">mise-en-scène</a>", ... moving depiction of the universal human experiences of love and loss in the age of AIDS, and especially for its success in shaking our preconceptions". The selection included <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>2,500 in prize money and a further C$2,500 worth of <a href="film%20processing">film processing</a>. When accepting the award, Hoolboom quipped ""Frank's Cock" has never seemed so large"; Waugh, however, suggests that the title "caused more embarrassment than mirth" when it was read during the citation. Special citations were also read for Andrew Munger's "Make Some Noise" and <a href="Philip%20Hoffman%20%28filmmaker%29">Philip Hoffman</a>'s "Technilogic Ordering".

That year the film won a Golden Leopard at the <a href="Locarno%20International%20Film%20Festival">Locarno International Film Festival</a> in <a href="Locarno">Locarno</a>, Switzerland. At the <a href="Ann%20Arbor%20Film%20Festival">Ann Arbor Film Festival</a> in <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, "Frank's Cock" won Best Dramatic Film. The Canadian Filmmakers' Distribution Centre, which has distribution rights for the film, notes further awards at the Interfilm Festival in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> and Second Prize Experimental at the <a href="College%20of%20Mass%20Communication%20%26amp%3B%20Media%20Arts%23Big%20Muddy%20Film%20Festival">Big Muddy Film Festival</a> in <a href="Carbondale%2C%20Illinois">Carbondale, Illinois</a> (both 1995), while Hoolboom records "Frank's Cock" as receiving an honourable mention at the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a>'s Queer Film Fest (1994).

The script for "Frank's Cock" has been published several times, including in the script anthology "By the Skin of Their Tongues" and in the "Journal of Film and Video" (both 1997). The film influenced Adam Garnet Jones' "Secret Weapons" (2008), commissioned by the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre in celebration of its fortieth anniversary. However, unlike "Frank's Cock", "Secret Weapons" focused on an <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> identity within <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">Canada's native community</a>.

After his success at the TIFF, Hoolboom directed numerous further films, many showing a "fascination with its impermanence"; several, including "Letters From Home", dealt explicitly with AIDS. Rennie, who had also received critical acclaim for his supporting role in <a href="Mina%20Shum">Mina Shum</a>'s "<a href="Double%20Happiness%20%28film%29">Double Happiness</a>" (1994), later became known for playing villains in Hollywood films.

Rhythm Killers

Rhythm Killers is a <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by Jamaican musical duo <a href="Sly%20and%20Robbie">Sly and Robbie</a>. It was released in May 1987 by <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>.

By the time of the album's recording, Sly and Robbie had transitioned away from their prolific work in the <a href="reggae">reggae</a> genre. They spent the 1980s experimenting with <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> sounds and contemporary recording technology on international, cross-genre endeavors, as reflected by "Rhythm Killers". For the album, they enlisted record producer <a href="Bill%20Laswell">Bill Laswell</a> and an ensemble of musicians to work with at Quad Recording in New York City. Along with their live instruments, the duo used electronic recording equipment such as the <a href="Fairlight%20CMI">Fairlight CMI</a> synthesizer and <a href="electronic%20drum">electronic drum</a>s.

The predominantly <a href="funk">funk</a> and <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">dance</a>-oriented album is arranged into two <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">side</a>-long gapless <a href="suite%20%28music%29">suites</a> of songs. Other styles featured on the record include <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, <a href="worldbeat">worldbeat</a>, and <a href="downtown%20music">downtown music</a>. Laswell's densely <a href="multitrack%20recording">layered</a> production incorporated electronic <a href="groove%20%28music%29">grooves</a>, hard beats, string synthesizers, and <a href="Cross-beat">cross-rhythms</a> produced by turntable <a href="scratching">scratches</a>, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive <a href="rapping">raps</a>.

"Rhythm Killers" <a href="record%20chart">charted</a> in four countries, including the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 35. It was promoted with two <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a>, including the UK hit "Boops (Here to Go)". The album received positive reviews from critics and was ranked in year-end lists by "<a href="NME">NME</a>" magazine and "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, who named it the seventh best record of 1987. Encouraged by its success, Sly and Robbie continued their digital direction on subsequent albums. "Rhythm Killers" has since been <a href="out%20of%20print">out of print</a>.

Amid their prolific <a href="reggae">reggae</a> output as sessions musicians, solo artists, and production duo, <a href="Sly%20and%20Robbie">Sly and Robbie</a>—drummer <a href="Sly%20Dunbar">Sly Dunbar</a> and bassist Robbie Shakespeare—opened their own record label Taxi Records and attained a distribution deal with <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a> during the early 1980s. After Island founder and executive <a href="Chris%20Blackwell">Chris Blackwell</a> hired them to work with singer <a href="Grace%20Jones">Grace Jones</a>, the duo developed a more sparse, robotic production style with <a href="funk">funk</a> and <a href="Dub%20music">dub</a> influences. This deviated from their past reggae work, as well as the genre's <a href="roots%20reggae">roots</a> sound and light rhythms. Sly and Robbie recorded primarily at Blackwell's <a href="Compass%20Point%20Studios">Compass Point Studios</a> in the Bahamas with state-of-the-art equipment, which led to Dunbar's experimentation with <a href="electronic%20drum">electronic drum</a>s and <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a>s.

After their work with <a href="Black%20Uhuru">Black Uhuru</a> and that group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued more international music endeavors. They branched out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer <a href="Bill%20Laswell">Bill Laswell</a>, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>'s 1985 album "<a href="She%27s%20the%20Boss">She's the Boss</a>". In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album "<a href="Language%20Barrier%20%28Sly%20and%20Robbie%20album%29">Language Barrier</a>", which had guest contributions from <a href="Herbie%20Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>, <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="Afrika%20Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a>, and <a href="Manu%20DiBango">Manu DiBango</a>. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film "<a href="Never%20Say%20Never%20Again">Never Say Never Again</a>". The track had been done with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.

A dub album, "Language Barrier" showcased a musical clash between the duo's characteristic rhythms and Laswell's own production style, with African jazz influences, predominant use of the <a href="Fairlight%20CMI">Fairlight CMI</a> <a href="Sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">sampling</a> <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>, and experimentations with tempo and dub techniques. Dunbar was enthused by newer recording technology and, in a 1987 interview for "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>", said that he wanted to "be a part of it, not be left out." Although it had a lukewarm reception from <a href="music%20journalism">music critics</a>, "Language Barrier" was Sly and Robbie's first work to receive international exposure. For their next album, they sought to record a like-minded album to expand their audience.

After releasing "The Sting" (1986) and "Electro Reggae" (1987) as members of their Taxi Gang band, Sly and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on "Rhythm Killers". They recorded the album over a period of three months at Quad Recording in New York City. Before entering the studio, Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demos</a> to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at the studio, as they had been known to do since their early years in Jamaica.

In an effort to <a href="Crossover%20%28music%29">crossover</a> with music listeners outside of reggae's market, Sly and Robbie heightened their experimentation with other musical sounds, particularly funk and occasional <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a>. Despite his eclectic output, Laswell himself had started out as a bass player in funk groups, an experience that inspired him to compose his musical arrangements with a rhythmic foundation. Dunbar explained their approach for the album in an interview for "<a href="Musician%20%28magazine%29">Musician</a>" at the time, saying that "We're trying to get new fans. Once they come into the funk, they're going to have to come into the reggae, because that's where we're going to take them." Sly and Robbie's direction was also influenced by the supervision of Blackwell who, according to Dunbar, "wanted us to make two tracks, 17 minutes long. So we cut two tracks and extended them, each <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">side</a> consisting of three songs. Non-stop dancing, that's the idea."

In the early stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused primarily on constructing difficult <a href="groove%20%28music%29">grooves</a> for songs. To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone and <a href="Cut%20%28music%29">cut</a> a drum part without having a melody in mind. He recounted his approach for the album to "Musician", saying that "I just played what I felt, working from a sense of 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.' And Robbie would come in the next night and lay a bass part." Unlike most reggae or funk bassists, Shakespeare approached his playing as a <a href="jazz">jazz</a> soloist and attempted numerous subtle <a href="variation%20%28music%29">variations</a> to his <a href="riff%20%28music%29">riff</a>. He said that his inspiration "comes from God. Sometimes endless ideas just keep coming to me. Sometimes I'll change the <a href="drum%20beat">drum pattern</a> to a bass line and Sly will play the <a href="bassline">bass line</a> on the drums." Along with live percussion, Dunbar played <a href="Simmons%20%28electronic%20drum%20company%29">Simmons drums</a>, and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording. Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds.

Sly and Robbie worked with an ensemble of musicians, including funk artists <a href="Bootsy%20Collins">Bootsy Collins</a>, <a href="Bernie%20Worrell">Bernie Worrell</a>, and <a href="Sly%20Fox%20%28band%29">Gary "Mudbone" Cooper</a>, reggae vocalist <a href="Shinehead">Shinehead</a>, <a href="avant-garde%20jazz">avant-garde jazz</a> musicians <a href="Karl%20Berger">Karl Berger</a> and <a href="Henry%20Threadgill">Henry Threadgill</a>, hip hop artist <a href="Rammellzee">Rammellzee</a>, turntablist <a href="Grand%20Mixer%20DXT">D.S.T.</a>, and guitarist <a href="Nicky%20Skopelitis">Nicky Skopelitis</a>. "Rhythm Killers" was produced by Laswell with his band <a href="Material%20%28band%29">Material</a>, which included Shakespeare, vocalist <a href="Bernard%20Fowler">Bernard Fowler</a>, and percussionist <a href="A%C3%AFyb%20Dieng">Aïyb Dieng</a>, among others. Sly and Robbie recorded songs in single <a href="take">take</a>s and cut approximately 20 tracks a day with Laswell and engineer <a href="Robert%20Musso">Robert Musso</a>, who used <a href="Reel-to-reel%20audio%20tape%20recording">reel-to-reel tape recording</a>. Laswell also hired violinist <a href="Mark%20Feldman">Mark Feldman</a>, who was working at a <a href="dinner%20theater">dinner theater</a> in Connecticut at the time. He had Feldman read <a href="Chord%20chart">charts</a> in the strings section and play <a href="syncopation">syncopated</a> lines, which he found "a little more funky" than the theater. The album was <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> at <a href="Avatar%20Studios">The Power Station</a> and <a href="audio%20mastering">mastered</a> by <a href="Howie%20Weinberg">Howie Weinberg</a> at <a href="Masterdisk">Masterdisk</a> in New York City.

"Rhythm Killers" is characterized as a work of funk music by "<a href="Musician%20%28magazine%29">Musician</a>" magazine's Alan di Perna, while "<a href="Stereo%20Review">Stereo Review</a>" critic Phyl Garland called it a <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">dance</a> album. The album's songs feature <a href="Contrast%20%28music%29">contrasting</a> musical elements. Writer and musicologist <a href="Robert%20Palmer%20%28writer%29">Robert Palmer</a> viewed it as an attempt at "an ambitious dance-music synthesis, with funk the stylistic common denominator", adding that the "funk ethos – less is more, the groove is the tune – underlies all of Mr. Laswell's work". Although it is not a reggae album, "Rhythm Killers" exhibits Sly and Robbie's Taxi Records production aesthetic, which drew on their cultural connection to Jamaican <a href="Dance%20hall%20%28Jamaican%29">dance halls</a> and their collective interest in experimental <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> sounds. Dunbar was particularly fascinated with the <a href="Pollard%20Syndrum">Syndrum</a> instrument, and "Rhythm Killers" is one of the last albums to feature live drums by him. Incorporating mechanized beats, <a href="rocksteady">rocksteady</a> tempos, and sinuous bass, the aesthetic presaged <a href="ragga">ragga</a> music and the rise of digital instrumentation in reggae during the 1980s. Similar to "Language Barrier", "Rhythm Killers" has a dense, thudding sound and heavy-handed, humorless tone, but features more recognizable <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a>.

The songs on "Rhythm Killers" are typified by deep bass, striking beats, low-frequency grooves, improvisational rhythms, electronic percussion, <a href="disco">disco</a>-era string synthesizers, aggressive guitar riffs, and stylistic influences from reggae, early hip hop, <a href="downtown%20music">downtown music</a>, <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, and <a href="worldbeat">worldbeat</a> genres. They are densely <a href="Multitrack%20recording">layered</a> in a fashion similar to <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a>'s <a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a> production. Bud Kliment of "<a href="Trouser%20Press">Trouser Press</a>" said they comprise a groove-oriented "<a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a>" that is "heavy-bottomed from start to finish". Similar to the album's funk instrumentation, the guest rappers have exclamatory, confrontational tones and percussive vocals. The vocals are complemented by improvisatory turntable <a href="scratching">scratches</a> and both African- and Latin-influenced percussion, which resulted in <a href="Cross-beat">cross-rhythms</a> during the songs. Carl Matthews of the "<a href="Baltimore%20Afro-American">Baltimore Afro-American</a>" observed "a noticeable looseness in the vocals and a sort of <a href="Parliament-Funkadelic">P-Funk</a> quality to the rhythm tracks." Mat Smith from "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" said the enthusiastic music was driven by a "schizophrenic art of noise attack all lashed around a nonstop rhythm that bumps each track nose to tail tight."

According to the "<a href="Spin%20Alternative%20Record%20Guide">Spin Alternative Record Guide</a>" (1995), "Rhythm Killers" "truly broke ground" after the experimentation on "Language Barrier" and served as "the story of late-20th-century <a href="African-American%20music">black music</a> done as <a href="symphony">symphony</a>." Music journalist <a href="Peter%20Shapiro%20%28journalist%29">Peter Shapiro</a> noticed "a striking collision of <a href="urban%20culture">urban</a> sounds" in the album's music, while <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a> called it an "unpredictable salute to the liveliness and character of <a href="Urban%20contemporary">urban pop</a> music in its broadest sense." Mike Joyce of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" found it "more punchy and elastic" than "Language Barrier" and felt "the accent is still on electronic rhythms, but the mood is vibrantly expansive". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> called the album Sly and Robbie's "Laswellized <a href="art%20music">art</a>-funk statement". He characterized the duo as a "world pop" rhythm section and said their style is complemented by "a chauvinistic variation on Bill Laswell's usual international brigade". <a href="John%20Leland%20%28journalist%29">John Leland</a> argued that the album is "the continuous synthesis that Laswell promised on Herbie Hancock's '<a href="Rockit%20%28song%29">Rockit</a>'", "extended in both length and scope", as it features "a knack for unexpected juxtapositions and no respect for artificial boundaries." According to "<a href="The%20Nation">The Nation</a>", the sounds on the record ranged from <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> to <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>.
The album's songs are arranged into a <a href="Gapless%20playback">gapless</a> <a href="suite%20%28music%29">suite</a> on each side, both of which begin with <a href="cover%20version">covers</a> of early 1970s <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> songs. Garland writes that each side is stylistically "derived" from its respective opening track and distinguishes the two side-opening tracks as "anchoring songs [that] serve as starting points for uninterrupted improvisations in rhythm that build to multiple climaxes while drawing from wildly disparate musical styles." "Fire", a cover of the <a href="Ohio%20Players">Ohio Players</a>' 1974 <a href="Fire%20%28Ohio%20Players%20song%29">song of the same name</a>, was reworked as an extended <a href="vamp%20%28music%29">vamp</a> with an uncredited <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">sample</a> of <a href="Liquid%20Liquid">Liquid Liquid</a>'s 1983 song "Cavern", and lyrics proclaiming "bass" to be "<a href="Where%20no%20man%20has%20gone%20before">the final frontier</a>". It features vocals by Shinehead, whose rap begins with a <a href="Howard%20Cosell">Howard Cosell</a> impersonation, and Bootsy Collins, who advises listeners that "you have one desire and that's to dance until you drop." "Boop" is a <a href="Jamaican%20Patois">Jamaican Patois</a> slang term for a man who spends money for the benefit of a younger woman. Both "Fire" and "Boops (Here to Go)" touch on popular <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> topics.

Opening the second side, "Yes, We Can Can" is a cover of <a href="the%20Pointer%20Sisters">the Pointer Sisters</a> 1973 <a href="Yes%20We%20Can%20Can">song of the same name</a>, originally written by <a href="Allen%20Toussaint">Allen Toussaint</a>. It eschews the original song's jazz influence for hip hop elements, gritty dub, and <a href="Art%20of%20Noise">Art of Noise</a>-like grooves. Co-written by <a href="Shinehead">Shinehead</a>, "Rhythm Killer" features aggressive percussion, frantic <a href="Deejay%20%28Jamaican%29">toasting</a> by Shinehead, <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">descending</a> strings, and downtown saxophone <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrases</a> by Henry Threadgill. It was featured in the 1988 film "<a href="Colors%20%28film%29">Colors</a>". The song's groove transitions into "Bank Job", which has a relaxed style, lavish production, and <a href="accent%20%28music%29">accented</a> electronic rhythms.

"Rhythm Killers" was released by Island Records in May 1987, on <a href="compact%20disc">CD</a>, <a href="LP%20record">LP</a>, and <a href="compact%20cassette">cassette</a> formats. It reached the <a href="record%20chart">record chart</a>s in the Netherlands, Sweden, and New Zealand, where it reached its highest overall position at number 12 and charted for eight weeks. In the United Kingdom, it spent five weeks on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">albums chart</a>, peaking at number 35. It did not chart in the United States. The album's <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a>, "Boops (Here to Go)", reached number 22 on the US "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs">Dance Club Play Singles</a>. It was a <a href="hit%20single">hit</a> in the UK, where it charted for 11 weeks and reached number 12 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. The song was later sampled on <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a>' 2006 song "<a href="Rudebox%20%28song%29">Rudebox</a>". "Fire", the second single, peaked at number 14 in New Zealand, where it charted for nine weeks. It also peaked at number 60 and charted for four weeks in the UK.

"Rhythm Killers" was well received by contemporary critics. In a review for "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>", <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> remarked that having mastered reggae, Sly and Robbie proved they could perform funk music just as well. Steve Hochman from the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" hailed it as one of 1987's best records from any genre because of how Sly and Robbie drew on the funk's past 20 years, "from <a href="Sly%20and%20the%20Family%20Stone">Sly & the Family Stone</a> through <a href="George%20Clinton%20%28musician%29">George Clinton</a>, along the way throwing in reggae, rap and even a bit of <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a>." In "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", Gavin Edwards called it "a thirty-five-minute dance party full of surprises and strange noises", writing that it "sounds like the Great Missing <a href="disc%20jockey">DJ</a> Set—albeit one played by live musicians with perfect telepathy." "<a href="i-D">i-D</a>" magazine's Simon Witter said it was the most entertaining and exceptionally conceived dance album of the year, while Garland from "Stereo Review" called it one of the best dance records in some time because the duo's creative yet accessible urban dance music showed how to combine the best parts of older music with contemporary recording techniques. 

In a negative review, Greg Taylor from "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" criticized the music as "wallpaper" undermined by a gaudy hip hop production. John Leland of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" wrote that while "Rhythm Killers" may be ambitious and successful as a "dialogue on the crosscultural elasticity of the funk", it lacked vigor as actual funk music and never got beyond its concept and "into the funk". In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Palmer found the musical ideas innovative and its concept "a worthy one"—that "funk is the <a href="wikt%3ARosetta%20Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> of contemporary dance music"—but he observed an excess of disordered effects and funk-derived sounds on what were otherwise expressive rhythm tracks.

At the end of 1987, it was named the year's eighth best album by "<a href="The%20Face%20%28magazine%29">The Face</a>" magazine, and 25th best album by "<a href="NME">NME</a>", who also named "Boops (Here to Go)" the year's 18th best single. "<a href="Rockdelux">Rockdelux</a>" ranked "Rhythm Killers" 11th best, and "Boops (Here to Go)" the sixth best song of 1987. The album also finished 25th in the <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in "The Village Voice". Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, named it the seventh best album of the year. 

Encouraged by the record's success, Sly and Robbie recorded "The Summit" (1988), an instrumental ragga album with digital <a href="riddim">riddim</a>s that was decried by roots critics, and "Silent Assassin" (1990), a collaboration with several American rappers. The latter album's fusion of Jamaican dub and American hip hop was a precursor to the rise of <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> in the US during the early 1990s. Bootsy Collins, who had kept a low profile for much of the 1980s, followed-up his appearance on "Rhythm Killers" with a comeback album, "<a href="What%27s%20Bootsy%20Doin%27%3F">What's Bootsy Doin'?</a>", in 1988. Shinehead's own appearance on the album bolstered his mainstream exposure as he was receiving American radio airplay with his debut single and performing on an international tour. "Rhythm Killers" was <a href="reissue">reissue</a>d by Island on 4 June 1990, but eventually became <a href="out%20of%20print">out of print</a>.

In retrospect, culture critic <a href="Mark%20Anthony%20Neal">Mark Anthony Neal</a> deemed "Rhythm Killers" an essential album of 1980s underground funk, while reggae historian <a href="Steve%20Barrow">Steve Barrow</a> cited it as one of the most engaging projects Sly and Robbie were involved in during the 1980s. In a retrospective article, "<a href="The%20State%20%28newspaper%29">The State</a>" wrote that on albums such as "Rhythm Killers", they frequently attempted to broaden the role of their instruments and consequently took bass and drums to "unexplored rhythmic frontiers". Music journalist Mark Coleman, writing in "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>", said that the album was "so coherent and smooth that you could mistake it for a suite if it wasn't also so thoroughly down and dirty." In "<a href="Rough%20Guides">The Rough Guide to Rock</a>" (2003), Peter Shapiro cited the album as Laswell's "best outside production" and one that "fulfilled his fusion/fission concept ... in which some of the finest dance musicians in the world jam on two side-long grooves that imply <a href="New%20Orleans%20rhythm%20and%20blues">New Orleans R&B</a>, 70s funk, hip-hop and ragga are all part of the same continuum." In a mixed review, <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> editor Stephen Cook called it "a valiant venture gone awry" and felt that the songs are monotonous and comprising "one tired electronic groove after another".

All tracks were produced by <a href="Bill%20Laswell">Bill Laswell</a> and <a href="Material%20%28band%29">Material</a>.

History of Liverpool F.C. (1985–present)

The history of <a href="Liverpool%20Football%20Club">Liverpool Football Club</a> from 1985 to the present day covers the appointment of <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> as manager, the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a>, and the club's return to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%20in%20European%20football">European competition</a> in 1991. Throughout this period, the club played in the top tier of English football, which in 1992 became the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.

Dalglish was appointed as <a href="Player-coach">player and manager</a> after <a href="Joe%20Fagan">Joe Fagan</a> resigned following the 1985 <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>, which resulted in Liverpool's indefinite ban from European competition. Liverpool won the league championship and <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in Dalglish's first season, and won a further league championship in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1987–88</a>. The Hillsborough disaster, which occurred during an FA Cup semi-final against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> at <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough Stadium</a> in April 1989, resulted in the deaths of 96 of the club's supporters. After the disaster, Dalglish led the club to their 18th title, in <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1989–90</a>; but the job was becoming too stressful and he resigned in February 1991. The <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> into the disaster recommended the end of standing terraces; to comply with its findings, <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> was converted to an <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a> during the early 1990s, which greatly reduced its capacity.

Dalglish's successor <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a> won the FA Cup in his first full season in charge. In the newly formed Premier League, he struggled to sustain the club's domestic successes, and was replaced by <a href="Roy%20Evans">Roy Evans</a> midway through the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20FA%20Premier%20League">1993–94 season</a>. Liverpool improved to fourth the following season and won the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a>. In 1998, <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a> was appointed co-manager alongside Evans. The arrangement lasted until November when Evans resigned and Houllier became the sole manager. The club won a unique <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> of trophies in 2001, and a year later finished second to Arsenal, their highest league finish in 11 years. Houllier departed the club in mid-2004.

Liverpool won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the fifth time in <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a>'s debut season, and he guided the club to a further FA Cup success in 2006. Midway through the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2006–07 season</a>, the club was bought by Americans <a href="Tom%20Hicks">Tom Hicks</a> and <a href="George%20N.%20Gillett%2C%20Jr.">George Gillett</a>. At the start of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a>, Liverpool were on the verge of bankruptcy; the club was sold to <a href="Fenway%20Sports%20Group">New England Sports Ventures</a> following a high court ruling. <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a>, who took over from Benítez, left the club in 2011, and Dalglish was again placed in charge of team affairs. He was replaced by <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> after the team finished eighth in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Premier%20League">2011–12 season</a>. Rodgers guided Liverpool to second in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a>, but board disagreements over transfers and poor team performances led to his sacking in October 2015. <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a> was his replacement.

Dalglish became manager following the resignation of Fagan after the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>. He started by replacing long-serving full-backs <a href="Phil%20Neal">Phil Neal</a> and <a href="Alan%20Kennedy">Alan Kennedy</a> with <a href="Steve%20Nicol">Steve Nicol</a> and <a href="Jim%20Beglin">Jim Beglin</a>. Liverpool began the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1985–86 season</a> poorly and were ten points behind <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> at the end of September. The club continued to struggle until the end of the season when they won eleven of their last twelve matches, as their rivals were dropping points. Liverpool needed to beat <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in the last game of the season to win the league championship. A goal from Dalglish secured the championship. The club also progressed to the <a href="1986%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1986 FA Cup Final</a>, where they faced <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. Liverpool went behind to a first-half goal from <a href="Gary%20Lineker">Gary Lineker</a>, but two goals from <a href="Ian%20Rush">Ian Rush</a> and a <a href="Craig%20Johnston">Craig Johnston</a> goal in the second half secured a 3–1 victory. The club had achieved a double of league championship and FA Cup in the same season for the first time.
At the start of the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1986–87 season</a>, Rush announced his intention to leave Liverpool for Italian team <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> when the season was finished. Rush did not want to leave but the club decided to sell him, as they were short of money due to their expulsion from European competition. Midway through the season, Dalglish signed <a href="John%20Aldridge">John Aldridge</a> to replace Rush when he left. Prior to his departure, Rush scored 40 goals. Liverpool finished second in the league behind Everton, and were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>. The club did reach the <a href="1987%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1987 Football League Cup Final</a>, but they were beaten 2–1 by <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. At the end of the season, Dalglish signed <a href="Peter%20Beardsley">Peter Beardsley</a> and <a href="John%20Barnes%20%28footballer%29">John Barnes</a> to improve their attack. Liverpool regained the league championship; they did not suffer defeat until their 29th match against Everton, one of two losses during the season. The club had the chance to complete the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">double</a>, as they reached the <a href="1988%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> of the FA Cup against <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon</a>. Although favourites against a club who had only become a member of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> eleven years previously, they lost the match 1–0.

Rush returned to Liverpool for the start of the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1988–89 season</a>, due to homesickness. Liverpool struggled at the start of the season and by January they were nine points behind leaders Arsenal; by April the teams were level on points, and Arsenal were ahead on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>. By this time, Liverpool had reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> at <a href="Hillsborough%20stadium">Hillsborough stadium</a> on 15 April 1989. Within six minutes the match was abandoned; overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end of the ground resulted in the death of ninety-six people, as they were crushed against perimeter fencing. Ninety-four fans died, in what became known as the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a>, that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness. Liverpool won the replay 3–1 to reach the <a href="1989%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> against Everton. They led for the majority of the match from an Aldridge goal. <a href="Stuart%20McCall">Stuart McCall</a> scored in the 89th minute to take the game into extra-time. Substitute Rush scored in the 95th minute, but McCall scored again in the 102nd minute to level the match. Another goal from Rush two minutes later secured a 3–2 victory for Liverpool. Once again, Liverpool had a chance at the double. Their final match of the season was against second-placed Arsenal, who were three points behind. The game had originally been scheduled for 23 April, but Liverpool's FA Cup commitments meant it was postponed and rearranged for 26 May. Arsenal needed to win <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%200%E2%80%932%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20%2826%20May%201989%29">the match</a> by two clear goals to win the league championship. They took the lead in the 52nd minute when striker <a href="Alan%20Smith%20%28footballer%20born%201962%29">Alan Smith</a> scored. With the match in <a href="Association_football%23Duration_and_tie-breaking_methods">injury time</a>, <a href="Michael%20Thomas%20%28footballer%20born%201967%29">Michael Thomas</a> scored to give Arsenal a 2–0 victory. The result meant Arsenal won the championship on goals scored.

After the season, an inquiry headed by <a href="Peter%20Taylor%2C%20Baron%20Taylor%20of%20Gosforth">Lord Taylor</a> was set up to establish the causes of the Hillsborough disaster. The subsequent <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>, published in 1990, found that failure of police control was the main reason for the disaster and recommended that major stadiums remove terracing and become all-seater venues. Liverpool started the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1989–90 season</a> in good form, exemplified by a <a href="Liverpool%209%E2%80%930%20Crystal%20Palace%20%281989%29">9–0</a> victory over newly promoted <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. Eight different players scored for the club, the only time this has occurred in English football. In October and November they lost four games, but they recovered to go unbeaten until a 1–0 loss to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in March. Following the match, Liverpool signed forward <a href="Ronny%20Rosenthal">Ronny Rosenthal</a> on loan from <a href="Standard%20Li%C3%A8ge">Standard Liège</a>. His impact was immediate; he scored seven goals in eight appearances, including a hat-trick against <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> to help Liverpool to their eighteenth league championship. The club progressed to the semi-finals of the FA Cup, but they lost 4–3 to Crystal Palace after extra time.

Liverpool started the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1990–91 season</a> by winning their first eight league games. They remained unbeaten until a 3–0 loss to Arsenal in December, followed by another to Crystal Palace at the end of the month. The club's form began to tail off and Arsenal moved above them in January. After a 4–4 draw against Everton in an FA Cup replay in February, Dalglish announced his resignation as manager, citing stress as the reason. Coach <a href="Ronnie%20Moran">Ronnie Moran</a> became caretaker manager; he won three of the ten matches he was in charge of, as they fell further behind Arsenal. Former player <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a> was announced as manager in April, but the club were unable to catch Arsenal, who won the league by seven points. Souness reshaped the team during the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1991–92 season</a>, which not been replenished by Dalglish since the signings of Barnes and Beardsley. Beardsley, <a href="Gary%20Gillespie">Gary Gillespie</a> and <a href="Steve%20McMahon%20%28footballer%29">Steve McMahon</a> were sold. Souness bought <a href="Dean%20Saunders">Dean Saunders</a> for £2.9 million, but Liverpool finished in sixth position, the first time they had finished outside the top two since 1981. The club did reach the <a href="1992%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> of the FA Cup against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, which they won 2–0. The season saw Liverpool compete in Europe for the first time since the Heysel stadium disaster in 1985; they were readmitted a year after other English clubs. Liverpool reached the quarter-finals of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, where they lost to Italian team <a href="Genoa%20C.F.C.">Genoa</a> 4–1 over two legs. <a href="The%20Boot%20Room">The Boot Room</a>, which had been a meeting place for Liverpool's coaches since <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> was manager was demolished during Souness' time at the club. A new press room was built in its place.

Anfield was redeveloped at the start of the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1992–93 season</a> following the recommendations of the Taylor report. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand, which included <a href="executive%20boxes">executive boxes</a> and <a href="Conference%20hall">function suites</a> as well as 11,000 seats. Renamed the Centenary Stand, it was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by <a href="UEFA">Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)</a> <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20UEFA">president</a> <a href="Lennart%20Johansson">Lennart Johansson</a>. In the inaugural season of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, Liverpool again finished in sixth place, losing fifteen of their forty-two matches. They exited early in the FA Cup, League Cup and <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>. In the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1993–94 season</a> Liverpool won their first three games, but their form dipped as they lost four consecutive games. One positive was the emergence of striker <a href="Robbie%20Fowler">Robbie Fowler</a> from the club's youth team. He scored on his first-team debut against <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in the first leg of a League Cup tie, and scored all five goals in the return leg as Liverpool won 5–0. Liverpool continued to struggle during the season, culminating in a defeat to <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> in an FA Cup replay. Souness was sacked after the match and replaced by coach <a href="Roy%20Evans">Roy Evans</a>. The club ended the season in eighth place after losing sixteen of their games. Liverpool began to fall behind their rivals off the pitch. Manchester United made £93 million after they were floated on the stock market, while Liverpool made £22 million when media company <a href="Granada%20plc">Granada</a> bought 9.9% of the club.
After the construction of the Centenary Stand, the <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadia%29">Spion Kop</a> was redeveloped for the start of the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1994–95 season</a>. The stand became all-seater, retaining the single tier with a reduced capacity of 12,000. In Evans's first full season in charge Liverpool finished in fourth place, their best finish since the departure of Dalglish. The club reached the sixth round of the FA Cup, before losing 2–1 to Tottenham Hotspur and reached the <a href="1995%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1995 Football League Cup Final</a> against <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. Two goals from <a href="Steve%20McManaman">Steve McManaman</a> helped Liverpool to a 2–1 victory as they won their fifth League Cup. The season also saw several long-serving players leave the club, as Grobbelaar, Nicol and <a href="Ronnie%20Whelan">Ronnie Whelan</a> departed. Before the start of the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1995–96 season</a>, Liverpool signalled their intent to improve upon the previous season, signing forward <a href="Stan%20Collymore">Stan Collymore</a> for a British club record £8.5 million. Collymore scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> in the first game of the season. Liverpool finished in third place. They reached the <a href="1996%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> of the FA Cup against Manchester United; an 85th-minute goal from <a href="Eric%20Cantona">Eric Cantona</a> secured a 1–0 victory for United.

Liverpool started the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1996–97 season</a> well, and by the turn of the year they were top of the league, two points clear of Arsenal. The club were unable to maintain their form during the rest of the season, losses to <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>, Manchester United and Wimbledon resulted in the club finishing the season in fourth position. Despite early exits in the League and FA Cup, Liverpool reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They were unable to progress after a 3–0 defeat in the first-leg, despite winning the second leg 2–0 and were knocked out 3–2 on aggregate against French team <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris Saint-Germain</a>. Liverpool were without striker Fowler for the start of the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1997–98 season</a> after he suffered knee ligament damage in a pre-season friendly. This was offset by the emergence of <a href="Michael%20Owen">Michael Owen</a>, who scored eighteen goals from thirty-six appearances. <a href="Paul%20Ince">Paul Ince</a> was signed to replace Barnes who joined <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. Liverpool were unable to challenge eventual winners Arsenal and finished thirteen points behind in third place. Further redevelopment took place at Anfield during the season with a second tier added to the Anfield Road stand.

Liverpool appointed Frenchman <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a> as co-manager alongside Evans for the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>. Poor results put pressure on the partnership and after a 3–1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup, Evans resigned. Houllier's first game as sole manager was a 3–1 defeat to Leeds United. Liverpool's form did not improve under Houllier and early exits in the UEFA and FA Cup were followed by the club finishing the season in seventh place, missing the qualification spots for European competition. Houllier reshaped the squad at the start of the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000 season</a>. New players were brought into the squad such as <a href="Dietmar%20Hamann">Dietmar Hamann</a>, <a href="Sami%20Hyypi%C3%A4">Sami Hyypiä</a> and <a href="Sander%20Westerveld">Sander Westerveld</a>; <a href="David%20James%20%28footballer%29">David James</a>, Ince and McManaman left the club. Houllier continued the reshaping into the season when he signed forward <a href="Emile%20Heskey">Emile Heskey</a> for a club record £11 million in March. Liverpool failed to secure a return to the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, as they finished the season in fourth place. Their also performed poorly in the FA and League Cup, exiting early in both competitions.
In the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2000–01 season</a> Liverpool won three competitions to complete a unique <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> of trophies. The first trophy was the League Cup, when they beat <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> 5–4 in a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a> after the match had finished <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1–1</a>. They then won the FA Cup, as Owen scored two goals in the last ten minutes to overturn a one-goal deficit to win <a href="2001%20FA%20Cup%20Final">the match against Arsenal 2–1</a>. The final trophy the club won was the UEFA Cup. An own goal in the last minute of <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a> by <a href="Delf%C3%AD%20Geli">Delfí Geli</a> secured a <a href="2001%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">5–4</a> victory over Spanish team <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">Alavés</a>. Liverpool finished the league in third place, securing a return to the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) for the first time since the Heysel Stadium disaster. Liverpool's participation in the UEFA Champions League in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2001–02 season</a> saw the club reach the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by German team <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> 4–3 on aggregate. The season was Liverpool's best in the league in recent years, as they finished second, seven points behind Arsenal. Despite their improved performance in the league, Liverpool were unable to defend the FA and League Cup, exiting in the fourth and third rounds respectively. The season was overshadowed by Houllier's heart problems. He suffered chest pain at half-time during a match with Leeds at Anfield. He had an eleven-hour operation to fix an acute <a href="aortic%20dissection">dissection of the aorta</a> and did not return until February. His assistant <a href="Phil%20Thompson">Phil Thompson</a> took charge of the team in the interim.

Houllier signed several players at the start of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2002–03 season</a>, including <a href="Bruno%20Cheyrou">Bruno Cheyrou</a>, <a href="Salif%20Diao">Salif Diao</a> and <a href="El-Hadji%20Diouf">El-Hadji Diouf</a>. The former was preferred to <a href="Nicolas%20Anelka">Nicolas Anelka</a>, despite the latter performing well during his loan from Paris Saint-Germain the previous season. Liverpool were unbeaten in their first twelve games in the league, which gave them a seven-point lead. A defeat to <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> in their next game started a run of twelve games without victory until they beat <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> 1–0 in January. The club finished the season in fifth place. Despite early exits in the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League, Liverpool won the League Cup, defeating Manchester United in the <a href="2003%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. The <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2003–04 season</a> started poorly for Liverpool as they lost their first game 2–1 to Chelsea. By the end of the year they had lost six of their eighteen matches in the league. In the second half of the season they only lost a further four games to finish in fourth position securing a place in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2004–05 UEFA Champions League</a>. They exited the UEFA and League Cup in the fourth round. In the FA Cup, they were eliminated by <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> 1–0 in a fifth-round replay. At the end of the season Houllier was replaced as manager by <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a>.

The <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a> was a disappointment in the league as Liverpool finished in fifth place outside the UEFA Champions League qualification places. They were eliminated from the FA Cup third round by <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>. The club reached the final of the League Cup, but <a href="2005%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">lost 3–2 to Chelsea</a>. Liverpool also reached the <a href="2005%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> of the UEFA Champions League and it appeared the club would lose their second final of the season when they were 3–0 down to Italian team <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> at half-time, but three goals in six minutes allowed Liverpool to draw level at 3–3. No goals in extra time meant the match went to a penalty shoot-out, which they won 3–2. A fifth-place finish in the Premier League meant Liverpool were not guaranteed entry into the Champions League and faced the prospect of not being able to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%202005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20qualification">required to start</a> in the first qualifying round. They were eliminated in the first knockout round by Portuguese team <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>. In the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a> they finished in third place. They also reached the <a href="2006%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2006 FA Cup Final</a> where they faced <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>. Liverpool won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out after the match finished 3–3.

The <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2006–07 season</a> was Liverpool's first after American businessmen <a href="George%20N.%20Gillett%20Jr.">George Gillett</a> and <a href="Tom%20Hicks">Tom Hicks</a> bought the club, in a deal which valued it and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. Liverpool once more came third in the league, this time 21 points behind Manchester United. They went out of both domestic cup competitions to Arsenal, but reached the <a href="2007%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2007 UEFA Champions League Final</a> where they again faced Milan. Unlike 2005, Liverpool were unable to recover from going behind, and lost the match 2–1. During the summer, Benítez strengthened his team by signing <a href="Fernando%20Torres">Fernando Torres</a> for a club record £24 million, and midfielders <a href="Ryan%20Babel">Ryan Babel</a> and <a href="Yossi%20Benayoun">Yossi Benayoun</a>. They drew thirteen of their 38 matches and finished the season in fourth place. Liverpool exited the FA and League Cup in the fifth round, but in the UEFA Champions League reached the semi-finals for the third time in four seasons, where they lost 4–3 on aggregate to Chelsea. Torres scored 33 goals in all competitions, and in the process broke two club records; he became the first Liverpool striker since Fowler to score more than 20 goals in a league season, and equalled <a href="Roger%20Hunt">Roger Hunt</a>'s run of scoring in consecutive league matches at Anfield (8).

In the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a> a 5–1 victory over Newcastle United in December gave Liverpool a three-point lead in the league with half of the season remaining. They did not win any games in January, and despite good form for the remainder of the season, were unable to catch Manchester United and finished in second place. In the FA and League Cup as they were eliminated in the fourth round. In the UEFA Champions League, they were again eliminated by Chelsea, this time at the quarter-final stage. The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a> was a disappointment for Liverpool as they were unable to improve on the previous season's performance, finishing seventh in the league. They lost eleven matches, nine more than the previous season, to finish outside the top four for the first time since 2005. The club also suffered poor form in the UEFA Champions League, they were eliminated in the group stages and subsequently entered the UEFA Cup (now rebranded as the UEFA Europa League). In the Europa League they reached the semi-finals. Their opponents were Spanish team <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, who progressed to the final on the away goals rule after the tie finished 2–2 on aggregate. Benitez left the club by mutual consent at the end of the season and was replaced by <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a>.
The club was sold to <a href="Fenway%20Sports%20Group">Fenway Sports Group</a> during the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a>. Accounts had shown that Liverpool were £350 million in debt with losses of £55 million, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion. <a href="The%20Royal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland">The Royal Bank of Scotland</a> who were the club's creditors, took owners Gillett and Hicks to court to force through a sale. The court ruled in the creditors' favour and the club was sold to Fenway Sports Group for £300 million on 15 October 2010. On the pitch, Liverpool's performances were poor. A 3–1 defeat to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> in January, left the club in twelfth place in the league with nine defeats from twenty games. Hodgson was sacked after the match and replaced by former manager Dalglish. After a loss in his first match against Manchester United in the FA Cup, Liverpool eventually finished the season in sixth place. Dalglish bought several players at the start of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2011–12 season</a>, including <a href="Charlie%20Adam">Charlie Adam</a>, <a href="Stewart%20Downing">Stewart Downing</a> and <a href="Jordan%20Henderson">Jordan Henderson</a>. They finished in eighth place, the club's worst finish in eighteen years. In both the League Cup and FA Cup, they reached the final. The club won a record eighth League Cup, with a <a href="2012%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">3–2</a> penalty shoot-out victory against <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> after the match finished 2–2. Liverpool lost the <a href="2012%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2012 FA Cup Final</a> 2–1 to Chelsea. The season was marred by the Luis Suárez racial abuse incident in October during a match against Manchester United, in which he racially abused <a href="Patrice%20Evra">Patrice Evra</a>. He was fined £40,000 and banned for eight games. Dalglish was sacked at the end of the season and replaced by <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a>.

Rodgers promised "to dedicate my life to fight for this club and defend the great principles of Liverpool Football Club on and off the field." Liverpool finished seventh in his first season, but outperformed expectations the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">following season</a> to put them into title contention. A run of 11 consecutive victories was halted by a 2–0 home loss to Chelsea. The defeat meant the title race was out of Liverpool's control. Having taken a 3–0 lead in their next match – away at Crystal Palace, Liverpool conceded three times in the final 15 minutes to draw 3–3. The result dented their title aspirations; although Liverpool went into the final day with a mathematical chance of winning the league, they were overhauled by Manchester City. In July, Suárez was sold to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> for £75 million, and the following January <a href="Steven%20Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> agreed a move to <a href="LA%20Galaxy">LA Galaxy</a> at the end of the campaign, ending 17 years at the club. Rodgers was sacked after a poor start to the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a>, and was replaced by German <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a>. Liverpool reached the finals of the League Cup and UEFA Europa League, losing the former 3–1 in a penalty shootout after <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">the match finished 1–1</a>, and <a href="2016%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">the latter</a> 3–1 to <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>.

Eraserhead

Eraserhead is a 1977 American <a href="Experimental%20film">experimental</a> <a href="Body%20horror">body horror film</a> written, produced, and directed by <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>. The film's <a href="film%20editing">editing</a>, score and <a href="sound%20design">sound design</a> were also helmed by Lynch, with pieces by a variety of other musicians also featured. Shot in <a href="black%20and%20white">black and white</a>, "Eraserhead" is Lynch's <a href="List%20of%20directorial%20debuts">first feature-length film</a>, following several short works. Starring <a href="Jack%20Nance">Jack Nance</a>, <a href="Charlotte%20Stewart">Charlotte Stewart</a>, <a href="Jeanne%20Bates">Jeanne Bates</a>, <a href="Judith%20Roberts%20%28actress%29">Judith Anna Roberts</a>, Laurel Near, and <a href="Jack%20Fisk">Jack Fisk</a>, it tells the story of Henry Spencer (Nance), who is left to care for his grossly deformed child in a desolate industrial landscape.

"Eraserhead" was produced with the assistance of the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> (AFI) during Lynch's time studying there. The film nonetheless spent several years in <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> because of funding difficulties; donations from Fisk and his wife <a href="Sissy%20Spacek">Sissy Spacek</a> kept production afloat. It was shot on several locations owned by the AFI in <a href="California">California</a>, including <a href="Greystone%20Mansion">Greystone Mansion</a> and a set of disused stables in which Lynch lived. Lynch and sound designer <a href="Alan%20Splet">Alan Splet</a> spent a year working on the film's audio after their studio was soundproofed. The soundtrack features organ music by <a href="Fats%20Waller">Fats Waller</a> and includes the song "<a href="In%20Heaven">In Heaven</a>", written for the film by <a href="Peter%20Ivers">Peter Ivers</a>.

Initially opening to small audiences and little interest, "Eraserhead" gained popularity over several long runs as a <a href="midnight%20movie">midnight movie</a>. Since its release, the film has earned positive reviews. The surrealist imagery and sexual undercurrents have been seen as key thematic elements, and the intricate <a href="sound%20design">sound design</a> as its technical highlight. In 2004, the film was preserved in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the United States <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

The Man in the Planet (<a href="Jack%20Fisk">Jack Fisk</a>) pulls levers in his home in space, while the head of Henry Spencer (<a href="Jack%20Nance">Jack Nance</a>) floats in the sky. A giant <a href="spermatozoon">spermatozoon</a>-like creature emerges from Spencer's mouth, floating into the void. The Man in the Planet appears to control the creature with his levers, eventually making it fall into a pool of water.

In an industrial cityscape, Spencer walks home with his groceries. He is stopped outside his apartment by the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall (<a href="Judith%20Anna%20Roberts">Judith Anna Roberts</a>), who informs him that his girlfriend, Mary X (<a href="Charlotte%20Stewart">Charlotte Stewart</a>), has invited him to dinner with her family. Spencer leaves his groceries in his apartment, which is filled with piles of dirt and dead vegetation. That night, Spencer visits X's home, conversing awkwardly with her mother. At the dinner table, he is asked to carve a chicken that X's talkative father, Bill (Allen Joseph), calls "man-made"; the bird writhes on the plate and gushes blood. After dinner, Spencer is cornered by X's mother, who asks him if he and Mary X had sexual intercourse, and then tries to kiss him. She tells him that X has had his child and that the two must marry. X, however, is not sure if what she bore is a child.

The couple move into Spencer's one-room apartment and begin caring for the child—a swaddled bundle with an inhuman, snakelike face, resembling the spermatozoon-like creature. The infant refuses all food, crying incessantly and intolerably. The sound drives X hysterical, and she leaves Spencer and the child. Spencer attempts to care for the child, and he learns that it struggles to breathe and has developed painful sores.

Spencer begins experiencing visions, again seeing the Man in the Planet, as well as the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near), who sings to him as she stomps upon spermatozoon-like creatures. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a pool of blood and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.

Spencer seeks out the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer returns to his room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of scissors and for the first time removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and <a href="white%20noise">white noise</a> crescendo.

Writer and director <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a> had previously studied for a career as an artist, and he had created several short films to animate his paintings. By 1970, however, he had switched his focus to film-making, and at the age of 24 he accepted a scholarship at the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>'s Center for Advanced Film Studies. Lynch disliked the course and considered dropping out, but after being offered the chance to produce a script of his own devising, he changed his mind. He was given permission to use the school's entire campus for film sets; he converted the school's disused stables into a series of sets and lived there. In addition, <a href="Greystone%20Mansion">Greystone Mansion</a>, also owned by the AFI, was used for many scenes.

Lynch had initially begun work on a script titled "Gardenback", based on his painting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back. "Gardenback" was a surrealist script about adultery, which featured a continually growing insect representing one man's lust for his neighbor. The script would have resulted in a roughly 45-minute-long film, which the AFI felt was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script. In its place, Lynch presented "Eraserhead", which he had developed based on a daydream of a man's head being taken to a pencil factory by a small boy. Several board members at the AFI were still opposed to producing such a surrealist work, but they acquiesced when Dean <a href="Frank%20Daniel">Frank Daniel</a> threatened to resign if it were to be vetoed. Lynch's script for "Eraserhead" was influenced by his reading as a film student; <a href="Franz%20Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>'s 1915 novella "<a href="The%20Metamorphosis">The Metamorphosis</a>" and <a href="Nikolai%20Gogol">Nikolai Gogol</a>'s 1836 short story "<a href="The%20Nose%20%28Gogol%20short%20story%29">The Nose</a>" were strong influences on the screenplay. Lynch also confirmed in an interview with "<a href="Metro%20Silicon%20Valley">Metro Silicon Valley</a>" that the film "came together" when he opened up a <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, read one verse from it, and shut it; in retrospect, Lynch could not remember if the verse was from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> or the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. In 2007, Lynch said "Believe it or not, "Eraserhead" is my most spiritual film."

The script is also thought to have been inspired by Lynch's fear of fatherhood; his daughter <a href="Jennifer%20Lynch">Jennifer</a> had been born with "severely <a href="clubbed%20feet">clubbed feet</a>", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child. Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of "Eraserhead". Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe ... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back". Film critic Greg Olson, in his book "David Lynch: Beautiful Dark", posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, giving the director a "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" which has subsequently shaped his films.

Initial casting for the film began in 1971, and Jack Nance was quickly selected for the lead role. However, the staff at the AFI had underestimated the project's scale—they had initially <a href="Greenlight">green-lit</a> "Eraserhead" after viewing a twenty-one page screenplay, assuming that the film industry's usual ratio of one minute of film per scripted page would reduce the film to approximately twenty minutes. This misunderstanding, coupled with Lynch's own meticulous direction, caused the film to remain in production for a number of years. In an extreme example of this labored schedule, one scene in the film begins with Nance's character opening a door—a full year passed before he was filmed entering the room. Nance, however, was dedicated to producing the film and retained the unorthodox hairstyle his character sported for the entirety of its gestation.

Buoyed with regular donations from Lynch's childhood friend Jack Fisk and Fisk's wife <a href="Sissy%20Spacek">Sissy Spacek</a>, production continued for several years. Additional funds were provided by Nance's wife <a href="Catherine%20E.%20Coulson">Catherine E. Coulson</a>, who worked as a waitress and donated her income, and by Lynch himself, who delivered newspapers throughout the film's principal photography. During one of the many lulls in filming, Lynch was able to produce the short film "<a href="The%20Short%20Films%20of%20David%20Lynch">The Amputee</a>", taking advantage of the AFI's wish to test new film stock before committing to bulk purchases. The short piece starred Coulson, who continued working with Lynch as a technician on "Eraserhead". "Eraserhead" production crew was very small, composed of Lynch; <a href="sound%20design">sound design</a>er <a href="Alan%20Splet">Alan Splet</a>; <a href="cinematography">cinematographer</a> Herb Cardwell, who left the production for financial reasons and was replaced with <a href="Frederick%20Elmes">Frederick Elmes</a>; production manager and prop technician Doreen Small; and Coulson, who worked in a variety of roles.

The physical effects used to create the deformed child have been kept secret. The projectionist who worked on the film's <a href="dailies">dailies</a> was blindfolded by Lynch to avoid revealing the prop's nature, and he has refused to discuss the effects in subsequent interviews. The prop—which Nance nicknamed "Spike"—featured several working parts; its neck, eyes and mouth were capable of independent operation. Lynch has offered cryptic comments on the prop, at times stating that "it was born nearby" or "maybe it was found". It has been speculated by "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" John Patterson that the prop may have been constructed from a skinned rabbit or a lamb fetus. The child has been seen as a precursor to elements of other Lynch films, such as <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">John Merrick</a>'s make-up in 1980's "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28film%29">The Elephant Man</a>" and the <a href="Sandworm%20%28Dune%29">sandworms</a> of 1984's "<a href="Dune%20%281984%20film%29">Dune</a>".

During production, Lynch began experimenting with a technique of recording dialogue that had been spoken phonetically backwards and reversing the resulting audio. Although the technique was not used in the film, Lynch returned to it for "<a href="Episode%202%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29">Episode 2</a>", the third episode of his 1990 television series "<a href="Twin%20Peaks">Twin Peaks</a>". Lynch also began his interest in <a href="Transcendental%20Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> during the film's production, adopting a <a href="vegetarianism">vegetarian diet</a> and giving up smoking and alcohol consumption.

Lynch worked with Alan Splet to design the film's sound. The pair arranged and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. Sounds were created in a variety of ways—for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb and frequency.

After a poorly received <a href="test%20screening">test screening</a>, in which Lynch believes he had mixed the soundtrack at too high a volume, the director cut twenty minutes of footage from the film, bringing its length to 89 minutes. Among the cut footage is a scene featuring Coulson as the infant's midwife, another of a man torturing two women—one again played by Coulson—with a car battery, and one of Spencer toying with a dead cat.

The soundtrack to "Eraserhead" was released by <a href="I.R.S.%20Records">I.R.S. Records</a> in 1982. The two tracks included on the album feature excerpts of organ music by <a href="Fats%20Waller">Fats Waller</a> and the song "<a href="In%20Heaven">In Heaven</a>", written for the film by <a href="Peter%20Ivers">Peter Ivers</a>. The soundtrack was re-released on August 7, 2012, by <a href="Sacred%20Bones%20Records">Sacred Bones Records</a> in a limited pressing of 1,500 copies. The album has been seen as presaging the <a href="dark%20ambient">dark ambient</a> music genre, and its presentation of background noise and non-musical cues has been described by <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>'s Mark Richardson as "a sound track (two words) in the literal sense".

"Eraserhead" sound design has been considered one of its defining elements. Although the film features several hallmark visuals—the deformed infant and the sprawling industrial setting—these are matched by their accompanying sounds, as the "incessant mewling" and "evocative aural landscape" are paired with these respectively. The film features several constant industrial sounds, providing low-level background noise in every scene. This fosters a "threatening" and "unnerving" atmosphere, which has been imitated in works such as <a href="David%20Fincher">David Fincher</a>'s 1995 thriller "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Seven</a>" and the <a href="Coen%20brothers">Coen brothers</a>' 1991 drama "<a href="Barton%20Fink">Barton Fink</a>". The constant low-level noise has been perceived by James Wierzbicki in his book "Music, Sound and Filmmakers: Sonic Style in Cinema" as perhaps a product of Henry Spencer's imagination, and the soundtrack has been described as "ruthlessly negligent of the difference between dream and reality". The film also begins a trend within Lynch's work of relating <a href="diegesis">diegetic</a> music to dreams, as when the Lady in the Radiator sings "In Heaven" during Spencer's extended dream sequence. This is also present in "Episode 2" of "Twin Peaks", in which diegetic music carries over from a character's dream to his waking thoughts; and in 1986's "<a href="Blue%20Velvet%20%28film%29">Blue Velvet</a>", in which a similar focus is given to <a href="Roy%20Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s "<a href="In%20Dreams%20%28Roy%20Orbison%20song%29">In Dreams</a>".

The film has also been noted for its strong sexual themes. Opening with an image of conception, the film then portrays Henry Spencer as a character who is terrified of, but fascinated by, sex. The recurring images of sperm-like creatures, including the child, are a constant presence during the film's sex scenes; the apparent "<a href="girl%20next%20door">girl next door</a>" appeal of the Lady in the Radiator is abandoned during her musical number as she begins to violently smash Spencer's sperm creatures and aggressively meets his gaze. David J. Skal, in his book "The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror", has described the film as "depict[ing] human reproduction as a desolate freak show, an occupation fit only for the damned". Skal also posits a different characterization of the Lady in the Radiator, casting her as "desperately eager for an unseen audience's approval". In his book "David Lynch Decoded", Mark Allyn Stewart proposes that the Lady in the Radiator is in fact Spencer's <a href="subconscious">subconscious</a>, a manifestation of his own urge to kill his child, who embraces him after he does so, as if to reassure him that he has done right.

As a character, Spencer has been seen as an <a href="everyman">everyman</a> figure, his blank expression and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a <a href="pacifism">pacifistic</a> and <a href="fatalism">fatalistic</a> inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by the domineering and controlling influences that beset him. Spencer's passivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip "<a href="The%20Angriest%20Dog%20in%20the%20World">The Angriest Dog in the World</a>".

"Eraserhead" premièred at the <a href="Filmex">Filmex</a> film festival in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, on March 19, 1977. On its opening night, the film was attended by twenty-five people; twenty-four viewed it the following evening. However, <a href="Ben%20Barenholtz">Ben Barenholtz</a>, head of distributor Libra Films International, persuaded local theater Cinema Village to run the film as a midnight feature, where it continued for a year. After this, it ran for ninety-nine weeks at New York's <a href="IFC%20Center">Waverly Cinema</a>, had a year-long midnight run at <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="Roxie%20Theater">Roxie Theater</a> from 1978 to 1979, and achieved a three-year tenure at Los Angeles' <a href="Nuart%20Theatre">Nuart Theatre</a> between 1978 and 1981. The film was a commercial success, grossing $7 million in the United States. "Eraserhead" was also screened as part of the 1978 <a href="BFI%20London%20Film%20Festival">BFI London Film Festival</a>, and the 1986 <a href="Telluride%20Film%20Festival">Telluride Film Festival</a>.

"Eraserhead" was released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> on August 7, 1982, by <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. The film was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> by <a href="Umbrella%20Entertainment">Umbrella Entertainment</a> in Australia; the former was released on August 1, 2009, and the latter on May 9, 2012. The Umbrella Entertainment releases include an 85-minute feature on the making of the film. Other home media releases of the film include DVD releases by <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a> in 2001, Subversive Entertainment in 2006, Scanbox Entertainment in 2008, and a DVD and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> release by <a href="the%20Criterion%20Collection">the Criterion Collection</a> in September 2014.

Upon "Eraserhead" release, "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" offered a negative review, calling it "a sickening bad-taste exercise". The review expressed incredulity over the film's long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable. Comparing "Eraserhead" to Lynch's next film "The Elephant Man", Tom Buckley of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" felt that while the latter was a well-made film with an accomplished cast, the former was not. Buckley called "Eraserhead" "murkily pretentious", and felt that the film's horror aspects stemmed solely from the appearance of the deformed child rather than from its script or performances. Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" felt that "Eraserhead" demonstrated that Lynch was "one of the most unalloyed surrealists ever to work in the movies". Rose described the film as being intensely personal, finding that unlike previous surrealist films, such as <a href="Luis%20Bu%C3%B1uel">Luis Buñuel</a>'s 1929 work "<a href="Un%20Chien%20Andalou">Un Chien Andalou</a>" or 1930's "<a href="L%27Age%20d%27Or">L'Age d'Or</a>", Lynch's imagery "isn't reaching out to us from his films; we're sinking into them". In a 1993 review for the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", Michael Wilmington described "Eraserhead" as unique, feeling that the film's "intensity" and "nightmare clarity" were a result of Lynch's attention to detail in its creation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production. In the 1995 essay "Bad Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks", critic <a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> felt that "Eraserhead" represented Lynch's best work. Rosenbaum felt that the director's artistic talent declined as his popularity grew, and contrasted the film with "<a href="Wild%20at%20Heart%20%28film%29">Wild at Heart</a>"—Lynch's most recent feature film at that time—saying "even the most cursory comparison of "Eraserhead" with "Wild at Heart" reveals an artistic decline so precipitous that it is hard to imagine the same person making both films".

Twenty-first century critical opinion of the film is widely positive. "Eraserhead" holds an average rating of 91% on <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregation</a> website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, representing the distillation of 56 reviews, with the critical consensus "David Lynch's surreal Eraserhead uses detailed visuals and a creepy score to create a bizarre and disturbing look into a man's fear of parenthood." Writing for "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine, Steve Beard rated the film five stars out of five. He felt that it was "a lot more radical and enjoyable than [Lynch's] later Hollywood efforts" and highlighted its mix of surrealist <a href="body%20horror">body horror</a> and <a href="black%20humor">black comedy</a>. The <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s Almar Haflidason awarded "Eraserhead" three stars out of five, describing it as "an unremarkable feat by [Lynch's] later standards". Haflidason felt that the film was a gathering of loosely related ideas, adding that it is "so consumed with surreal imagery that there are almost limitless possibilities to read personal theories into it"; the reviewer's own take on these themes were that they represented a fear of personal commitment and featured "a strong sexual undercurrent". A reviewer writing for <a href="Film4">Film4</a> rated "Eraserhead" five stars out of five, describing it as "by turns beautiful, annoying, funny, exasperating and repellent, but always bristling with a nervous energy". The Film4 reviewer felt that "Eraserhead" was unlike most films released to that point, save for the collaborations between <a href="Luis%20Bu%C3%B1uel">Luis Buñuel</a> and <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>; however, Lynch denies having seen any of these before "Eraserhead". Writing for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", Nathan Lee praised the film's use of sound, writing "to see the film means nothing—one must also "hear" it". He described the film's sound design as "an intergalactic seashell cocked to the ears of an <a href="LSD">acid-tripping</a> gargantua".

"The Guardian" Peter Bradshaw similarly lauded the film, also awarding it five stars out of five. Bradshaw considered it to be a beautiful film, describing its sound design as "industrial groaning, as if filmed inside some collapsing factory or gigantic dying organism". He highlighted the film's body horror elements, comparing it to <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s 1979 film "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>". Keith Phipps, writing for <a href="AllRovi">AllRovi</a>, also gave the film a rating of five stars out of five; he highlighted the disturbing sound design of the film and described it as "an open metaphor". He felt that "Eraserhead" "sets up the obsessions that would follow [Lynch] through his career", adding his belief that the film's surrealism enhanced the understanding of the director's later films. In an article for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", film-maker <a href="Marc%20Evans">Marc Evans</a> praised both the sound design and Lynch's ability "to make the ordinary seem so odd", considering the film an inspiration on his own work. A review of the film in the same newspaper compared "Eraserhead" to the works of Irish playwright <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>, describing it as a chaotic parody of family life. Manohla Dargis, writing for "The New York Times", called the film "less a straight story than a surrealistic assemblage". Dargis felt that the film's imagery evoked the paintings of <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a> and the <a href="Georges%20Franju">Georges Franju</a> 1949 documentary "<a href="Blood%20of%20the%20Beasts">Blood of the Beasts</a>". "<a href="Film%20Threat">Film Threat</a>" Phil Hall called "Eraserhead" Lynch's best film, believing that the director's subsequent output failed to live up to it. Hall highlighted the film's soundtrack and Nance's "<a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Chaplinesque</a>" physical comedy as the film's stand-out elements.

In 2004, "Eraserhead" was selected for preservation in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the United States <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>. Selection for the Registry is based on a film being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". "Eraserhead" was one of the subjects featured in the 2005 documentary "", which charted the rise of the <a href="midnight%20movie">midnight movie</a> phenomenon in the late 1960s and 1970s; Lynch took part in the documentary through a series of interviews. The production covers six films which are credited as creating and popularizing the genre; also included are "<a href="Night%20of%20the%20Living%20Dead">Night of the Living Dead</a>", "<a href="El%20Topo">El Topo</a>", "<a href="Pink%20Flamingos">Pink Flamingos</a>", "<a href="The%20Harder%20They%20Come">The Harder They Come</a>", and "<a href="The%20Rocky%20Horror%20Picture%20Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>". In 2010, the <a href="Online%20Film%20Critics%20Society">Online Film Critics Society</a> compiled a list of the 100 best directorial débuts, listing what they felt were the best first-time feature films by noted directors. "Eraserhead" placed second in the poll, behind <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>' 1941 "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>".

Lynch collaborated with most of the cast and crew of "Eraserhead" again on later films. Frederick Elmes served as cinematographer on "Blue Velvet", 1988's "The Cowboy and the Frenchman", and 1990's "<a href="Wild%20at%20Heart%20%28film%29">Wild at Heart</a>". Alan Splet provided sound design for "The Elephant Man", "Dune", and "Blue Velvet". Jack Fisk directed episodes of Lynch's 1992 television series "<a href="On%20the%20Air%20%28TV%20series%29">On the Air</a>" and worked as a production designer on 1999's "<a href="The%20Straight%20Story">The Straight Story</a>" and 2001's "<a href="Mulholland%20Drive%20%28film%29">Mulholland Drive</a>". Coulson and Nance appeared in "Twin Peaks", and made further appearances in "Dune", "Blue Velvet", "Wild at Heart", and 1997's "<a href="Lost%20Highway%20%28film%29">Lost Highway</a>".

Following the release of "Eraserhead", Lynch attempted to find funding for his next project, "<a href="Ronnie%20Rocket">Ronnie Rocket</a>", a film "about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair". Lynch met film producer <a href="Stuart%20Cornfeld">Stuart Cornfeld</a> during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed "Eraserhead" and was interested in producing "Ronnie Rocket"; he worked for <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Brooksfilms%20productions">Brooksfilms</a> at the time, and when the two realized that "Ronnie Rocket" was unlikely to find sufficient financing, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to consider for his next project. Cornfeld found four scripts that he felt would interest Lynch; on hearing the title of "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28film%29">The Elephant Man</a>", the director decided to make it his second film.

While working on "The Elephant Man", Lynch met American director <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, who revealed to Lynch that "Eraserhead" was his favorite film. "Eraserhead" also served as an influence on Kubrick's 1980 film "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28film%29">The Shining</a>"; Kubrick reportedly screened the film for the cast and crew to "put them in the mood" that he wanted the film to achieve. "Eraserhead" is also credited with influencing the 1989 Japanese cyberpunk film "", the experimental 1990 horror film "<a href="Begotten%20%28film%29">Begotten</a>", and <a href="Darren%20Aronofsky">Darren Aronofsky</a>'s 1998 directorial debut "<a href="Pi%20%28film%29">Pi</a>". Swiss artist <a href="H.%20R.%20Giger">H. R. Giger</a> cited "Eraserhead" as "one of the greatest films [he had] ever seen", and said that it came closer to realizing his vision than even his own films. According to Giger, Lynch declined to collaborate with him on "<a href="Dune%20%281984%20film%29">Dune</a>" because he felt Giger had "stolen his ideas".

Hurricane Nadine

Hurricane Nadine was the fourth <a href="List%20of%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20records%23Longest%20duration">longest-lived Atlantic hurricane</a> on record. The fourteenth <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> and <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> of the <a href="2012%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2012 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Nadine developed from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> west of <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> on September 10. By the following day, it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine. After initially tracking northwestward, Nadine turned northward, well away from any landmass. Early on September 15, Nadine reached hurricane status as it was curving eastward. Thereafter, an increase in vertical <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> weakened Nadine back to a tropical storm by September 16. On the following day, the storm began moving northeastward and threatened the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>; by late on September 19, however, Nadine veered east-southeastward before reaching the islands. Nonetheless, the storm produced tropical storm force winds on a few islands. On September 21, the storm curved south-southeastward while located south of the Azores. Later that day, Nadine transitioned into a non-tropical low pressure area.

Due to favorable conditions, the remnants of Nadine regenerated into a tropical cyclone on September 24. After re-developing, the storm executed a cyclonic loop and meandered slowly across the eastern Atlantic. Eventually, Nadine turned south-southwestward, at which time it became nearly stationary. By September 28, the storm curved northwestward and re-strengthened into a hurricane. The tenacious cyclone intensified further and peaked with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on September 30. By the following day, however, Nadine weakened back to a tropical storm, as conditions became increasingly unfavorable. Strong wind shear and decreasing <a href="sea%20surface%20temperatures">sea surface temperatures</a> significantly weakened the storm. Nadine transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> on October 3, shortly before merging with an approaching <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a> northeast of the Azores. The remnants of Nadine passed through the Azores on October 4 and again brought relatively strong winds to the islands.

A large tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa, on September 7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September 8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> gave the system a medium chance of <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a> within 48 hours. A <a href="low%20pressure%20area">low pressure area</a> developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September 9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September 10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200 UTC on September 10, while located about 885 miles (1,425 km) west of Cape Verde.

Although thunderstorm activity was initially minimal around the center of <a href="Atmospheric%20circulation">circulation</a>, convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized. Late on September 10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak intensity</a> T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large <a href="Ridge%20%28meteorology%29">subtropical ridge</a>. However, by September 11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and <a href="scatterometer">scatterometer</a> data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000 UTC on September 12.

By September 12, a <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a> developed and due to favorable conditions, the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapid deepening</a>. Intensification continued at a quicker albeit less than rapid rate on September 12. Later that day, sustained winds reached 65 mph (105 km/h). By early on September 13, convective banding wrapped almost completely around the center and cloud tops reached temperatures as low as . However, because microwave satellite data could not determine if an <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> had developed, Nadine's intensity was held at 70 mph (110 km/h) – just below the threshold of hurricane status. The National Hurricane Center noted that "the window for Nadine to strengthen may be closing", citing <a href="Computer%20simulation">computer model</a> consensus of an increase in wind shear and little change in structure. The storm then began experiencing moderate southwesterly wind shear on September 13, generated by a <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">mid- to upper-level trough</a> and a shear axis located a few hundred miles to the west of Nadine. As a result, the storm struggled to develop an eye and the center became more difficult to locate.

Although the storm was disorganized, a scatterometer pass indicated tropical storm force winds extended outward up to . The satellite appearance of Nadine became more ragged by September 14. Despite this, the storm remained just below hurricane status, and the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of intensification if wind shear were to decrease within the next few days. Nadine turned northward on September 14 as it tracked along the periphery of a subtropical ridge. Shortly thereafter, a <a href="Tropical%20Rainfall%20Measuring%20Mission">Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission</a> (TRMM) pass indicated that core convection began re-organizing. However, because wind shear displaced the mid-level circulation to the north of the low-level circulation, Nadine was not upgraded to a hurricane. Because Nadine would approach colder <a href="sea%20surface%20temperatures">sea surface temperatures</a>, significant strengthening was considered unlikely. Due to an increase in satellite intensity estimates and re-organization, Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800 UTC on September 14. Six hours later, Nadine reached an initial peak intensity with winds of . Satellite imagery indicated that a ragged eye feature was attempting to develop late on September 15.

Late on September 15, National Hurricane Center forecaster Robbie Berg noted that Nadine began "to look a little more ragged", as microwave data observations noted shearing of deep convection to the northeast of the center. Late on September 16, the eye became tilted and disappeared, convective bands began disorganizing, and the overall shower and thunderstorms activity waned since early that day. Nadine weakened back to a tropical storm on September 17. Additionally, a trough in the area caused Nadine to acquire a less tropical satellite appearance on September 17.

Dry air began impacting Nadine on September 17, though <a href="Outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> from the storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle, Nadine weakened slightly later that day. Further weakening occurred on the following day, after the burst in deep convection on September 17 deteriorated. Later on September 18, most of the deep convection dissipated, with the strongest of the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity being located within a band located west and northwest of the center.

Nadine threatened the Azores while moving northeastward and then northward between September 18 and September 19, though a blocking ridge prevented the storm from approaching further toward the islands. Its closest approach to the Azores was about south-southwest of <a href="Flores%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Flores Island</a> on September 19. The storm then re-curved east-southeastward on September 20, after the ridge weakened and the mid- to upper-level trough deepened. By late on September 21, much of the remaining deep convection was composed of only a ragged convective band with warming cloud tops. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center re-classified Nadine as a subtropical storm at 2100 UTC on September 21, mainly because it had a larger than average and asymmetrical wind field, as well as the development of an upper-level low pressure area near the center. However, post-season analysis concluded that Nadine degenerated into a non-tropical low pressure area three hours earlier.

Early on September 22, the National Hurricane Center noted that regeneration into a tropical cyclone was a distinct possibility. The remnant low pressure area soon moved over warmer seas and a low-shear environment, causing deep convection to re-develop. Thus, Nadine regenerated back into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on September 23. Another blocking ridge over the Azores forced Nadine to move west-northwestward on September 24, causing it to execute a small cyclonic loop. Although winds increased to 60 mph (95 km/h), the storm weakened again and decreased to a tropical storm on September 25. Despite this, satellite imagery indicated that Nadine developed an eye-like feature. However, the National Hurricane Center later noted that it was a cloud-free region near the center of the storm. By September 26, Nadine curved south-southwestward to southwestward around the southeastern portion of a mid- to upper-level ridge located over the western Atlantic.

After minimal change in strength for several days, Nadine finally began to intensify on September 27, due to sea surface temperatures warmer than . At 1200 UTC on September 28, Nadine re-strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale</a>. Around the time, satellite imagery indicated that the storm re-developed an eye feature. After becoming disorganized, the National Hurricane Center erroneously downgraded Nadine to a tropical storm on September 29, before upgrading it to a hurricane again six hours later. Nadine had actually remained a hurricane and was intensifying further. Winds increased to 85 mph (140 km/h) on September 30, after the eye became more distinct. At 1200 UTC, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of .

After peak intensity, Nadine began weakening once again and deteriorated to a tropical storm at 1200 UTC, on October 1. Northwesterly winds began to increase on October 3, after an upper-level trough that was causing low wind shear moved eastward. A few hours later, the low-level center became partially exposed, before becoming fully separated from the convection by 1500 UTC. Due to strong wind shear and cold sea surface temperatures, showers and thunderstorms rapidly diminished, and by late on October 3, Nadine became devoid of any deep convection. At 0000 UTC on October 4, Nadine transitioned into an extratropical low-pressure area, while located about 195 miles (315 km) southwest of the central Azores. The low rapidly moved northeastward, degenerated into a trough of low pressure, and was absorbed by a cold front later that day.

<a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">Tropical cyclone warnings and watches</a> were issued on two separate occasions as Nadine approached the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. At 1000 UTC on September 18, a tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of <a href="Flores%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Flores</a> and <a href="Corvo%20Island">Corvo</a>. Although the tropical storm watch was discontinued at 2100 UTC, a tropical storm warning was implemented at that time for the islands of Corvo, <a href="Faial%20Island">Faial</a>, Flores, <a href="Graciosa">Graciosa</a>, <a href="Pico%20Island">Pico</a>, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Jorge%20Island">São Jorge</a>, and <a href="Terceira%20Island">Terceira</a>. At 1500 UTC on September 19, a tropical storm warning was also issued for <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel</a> and <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island">Santa Maria</a>. All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on September 21. After re-generating, Nadine posed a threat to the Azores again, and thus, a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire archipelago at 1500 UTC on October 1. Nine hours later, 0000 UTC on the following day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. After Nadine became extratropical, the warning was discontinued. On the storm's second approach toward the Azores, schools were closed and flight were cancelled.

Late on September 20, Flores reported a wind gust of . A sustained wind speed of and a gust up to were reported at <a href="Horta%20%28Azores%29">Horta</a> on the island of Faial, as Nadine passed to the south on September 21. During the second Azores impact on October 4, the highest sustained wind speed reported was on São Miguel, while the strongest gust was at the Wind Power Plant on Santa Maria. On Pico Island, the pavement of the sports hall of the primary and secondary school in <a href="Lajes%20do%20Pico">Lajes do Pico</a> was destroyed. The remnants of Nadine produced a plume of moisture that dropped heavy rainfall over the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, particularly in <a href="England">England</a> and <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, reaching 5.12 in (130 mm) at <a href="Ravensworth">Ravensworth</a> in the former. The rains flooded houses and disrupted roads and rails.

Nadine lasted a total of 24 days as a tropical, subtropical and post-tropical cyclone, including 22.25 days as a tropical system. This makes it the fourth <a href="List%20of%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20records%23Longest%20duration">longest-lasting</a> Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, only behind the <a href="1899%20San%20Ciriaco%20hurricane">1899 San Ciriaco hurricane</a> at 28 days, <a href="Hurricane%20Ginger%20%281971%29">Hurricane Ginger</a> in 1971 at 27.25 days, and <a href="Hurricane%20Inga%20%281969%29">Hurricane Inga</a> in 1969 at 24.75 days. When only counting time spent as a tropical storm or hurricane – 20.75 days – Nadine is the third longest-lasting, behind only Hurricane Ginger in 1971 and the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane. When Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800 UTC on September 14, it marked the third-earliest forming eighth hurricane, behind only an <a href="1893%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">unnamed system in 1893</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Ophelia%20%282005%29">Ophelia</a> in <a href="2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2005</a>.

Diamonds (Rihanna song)

"Diamonds" is a song recorded by <a href="Barbadians">Barbadian</a> singer <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a> for her seventh studio album, "<a href="Unapologetic">Unapologetic</a>" (2012). It was written by <a href="Sia%20Furler">Sia Furler</a> together with its producers, <a href="Benny%20Blanco">Benny Blanco</a> and <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">StarGate</a>. The song premiered on September 26, 2012, during the "<a href="Elvis%20Duran%20and%20the%20Morning%20Show">Elvis Duran and the Morning Show</a>" and was <a href="music%20download">digitally</a> released the following day as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> from "Unapologetic". <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> serviced the single to <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit radio</a> in the United States on October 2. "Diamonds" is a mid-tempo <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a>, <a href="Electronic%20music">electronic</a> and <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> <a href="ballad">ballad</a> that features heavy <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s, orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms. The song's lyrics serve as a departure from the themes of unhealthy relationships that were on Rihanna's previous singles and contain a prominent concept of love.

"Diamonds" topped music charts in over twenty countries, including the United States, where it became Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Billboard%20Hot%20100%20chart%20achievements%20and%20milestones%23Most%20number-one%20singles">tied her</a> with <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> and <a href="The%20Supremes">The Supremes</a> for the fifth-most number one singles in the chart's history. "Diamonds" was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">quintuple platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) and sold over 3.5 million digital copies in the country. By May 2013, it had sold over 7.5 million copies worldwide and became <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles">one of the best-selling singles of all-time</a>.

The song's <a href="music%20video">music video</a> was shot by director <a href="Anthony%20Mandler">Anthony Mandler</a>, a frequent collaborator of Rihanna's, and depicts her in four environments that represent the elements of earth, air, water, and fire. The video received positive reviews and was praised for its imagery. Some critics believe that the heavily tattooed man intertwined with Rihanna's arm in the video resembles <a href="Chris%20Brown">Chris Brown</a>. The singer performed "Diamonds" on television shows such as "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" and "<a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">The X Factor</a>" and included it on the <a href="777%20Tour">777</a>, <a href="Diamonds%20World%20Tour">Diamonds</a>, <a href="The%20Monster%20Tour%20%28Eminem%20and%20Rihanna%29">Monster Tour</a> and the <a href="Anti%20World%20Tour">Anti World Tour</a> <a href="set%20list">set list</a>s. The <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Publishers">American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers</a> (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2013 and 2014. The official remix of "Diamonds" featured rapper <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a> and was released on November 16, 2012. The song has been covered by various recording artists, including <a href="Josef%20Salvat">Josef Salvat</a>, who released his own cover of "Diamonds" as a single.

In 2012, American songwriter and record producer <a href="Benny%20Blanco">Benny Blanco</a> met with Norwegian production duo <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">StarGate</a> at a recording studio in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to write new songs, including one for Rihanna. StarGate had previously produced her singles "<a href="Don%27t%20Stop%20the%20Music%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Don't Stop the Music</a>" (2007) and "<a href="Only%20Girl%20%28In%20the%20World%29">Only Girl (In the World)</a>" (2010). According to Blanco, he and StarGate wanted to deviate from Rihanna's usual sound and produce as though the song would be for a rapper such as <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a>: "It's the one that we weren't thinking Rihanna ... that turned into the Rihanna record ... But that's how it always happens like with me". They produced the song's drum machine beat after the other instrumental music was recorded.

StarGate's Mikkel Eriksen told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that Blanco took a recorded snippet of Eriksen's singing, altered it electronically, and made it sound "dirtier". He then applied timbre and used audio software to create ghostly accompaniment lines. Eriksen described Blanco's style as "unorthodox, as he almost never plays the keyboards but throws in weird samples and alters them to the right pitch to go with the song." Australian singer-songwriter <a href="Sia%20Furler">Sia</a> later joined them and wrote the lyrics for "Diamonds" in 14 minutes.

After the song was completed, they wanted to play it to Rihanna, but Blanco was skeptical about the reaction towards the song because of its slow sound. After StarGate played it to her, they called Blanco from <a href="London">London</a> and told him that she liked the song: "She's flippin' out. She played it like seven times in a row. It's her favorite song." <a href="Phil%20Tan">Phil Tan</a> and the assistant Daniela Rivera, mixed and mastered "Diamonds". Recalling it, in an interview with "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>", Blanco commented, "we needed to have it recorded, the beat finished, mixed and mastered in 24 hours. She was recording in a separate part of the world, sending back the files, we're finishing the music and then we're mixing and mastering it, and then it was out in a few days. It's fucking amazing and incredible." <a href="Kuk%20Harrell">Kuk Harrell</a> produced Rihanna's vocals on the song and recorded them together with Marcos Tovar.
On September 12, 2012, Def Jam France announced via <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> that Rihanna would release a new single the following week and that her seventh studio album will be released in November. However, the tweet was shortly deleted and replaced with another clarifying that more information will be given on September 13. In an interview with <a href="iHeartRadio">iHeartRadio</a> at their annual music festival in September, Rihanna confirmed "Diamonds" as her new single and said that it would first be played on American radio beginning September 26. She described it as an easy-going, but optimistic song that is "happy and hippy" rather than dance-oriented and said that the song "gives me such a great feeling when I listen to it. The lyrics are very hopeful and positive, but it's about love."

The single's cover artwork was revealed on September 24 and depicted Rihanna rolling diamonds in a manner suggestive of <a href="joint%20%28cannabis%29">joint</a> rolling. On September 26, Rihanna posted the full lyrics of the song in a <a href="PDF%20format">PDF</a> on her official website Rihanna7.com. "Diamonds" premiered the same day on the "<a href="Elvis%20Duran%20and%20the%20Morning%20Show">Elvis Duran and the Morning Show</a>", and on the following day, it was released as a <a href="music%20download">digital download</a> on the <a href="7%20Digital">7 Digital</a> store. In the United Kingdom, the song was released to 7 Digital on September 28. <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> solicited the single to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 2. On November 5, it was released in Germany as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a>, which it also contained the song's Bimbo Jones Vocal Remix. On December 18, eight digital remixes of the single were digitally released.

"Diamonds" has a length of three minutes and forty-five seconds. <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> critic Andy Kellman characterized it as a mid-tempo pop ballad, while Michael Baggs of <a href="Gigwise">Gigwise</a> described it as a mid-tempo <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> song. "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>"'s James Manning described the song as a "somber" <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> ballad. It features heavy <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s, orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms accompanied with Rihanna's vocal performance. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine wrote that "the track's production mainly stays out of Rihanna's way, letting the pop star build hooks with layers of her voice." In a review of "Unapologetic", Stacy-Ann Ellis of "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" noted that an improvement in the singer's singing is evinced by ballads such as "Diamonds" and "<a href="Stay%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Stay</a>". According to <a href="EMI%20Music">EMI Music Publishing</a>'s digital sheet music for the song, "Diamonds" is composed in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="B%20minor">B minor</a> and set in <a href="common%20time">common time</a> signature, and has a moderately slow <a href="Groove%20%28music%29">groove</a> of 92 <a href="Tempo">beats per minute</a>. Rihanna's vocals span from the low note of <a href="F%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">F</a> to the high note of <a href="F%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">F</a>.

Lyrically, "Diamonds" is a departure from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs, and contains a prominent concept of love. The first verse introduces the song's concept: "Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky." The hook continues this metaphor: "So shine bright, tonight, you and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive." According to Glenn Yoder of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>", the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as "I choose to be happy" and "We're like diamonds in the sky". James Montgomery of <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a> commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line "When you hold me, I'm alive", and admits "I knew that we'd become one right away". Lindsay DiMattina of <a href="Hollywood.com">Hollywood.com</a> interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as, "When you hold me, I'm alive," and "At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes." The "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>" asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life.

In a positive review of the song, Robert Copsey of <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a> gave it four out of five stars and praised Rihanna's direction towards a "softer and more prolific edge". Brittany Lewis of GlobalGrind called "Diamonds" a catchy song and felt that it had the potential to be another hit for Rihanna. Glenn Gamboa of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" said that, although it does not sound like an emphatic hit, the lyrical content of the song depicts a "personal shift" for Rihanna. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, "Diamonds" is more positive than previous singles such as "<a href="We%20Found%20Love">We Found Love</a>" and "<a href="Where%20Have%20You%20Been">Where Have You Been</a>", despite its moderate tempo. Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's singing is stronger than ever. <a href="Contactmusic.com">Contactmusic</a>'s reviewer described it as a "laid-back track", and suggested that the lyrical content is related to her former boyfriend <a href="Chris%20Brown%20%28American%20entertainer%29">Chris Brown</a>. In a track-by-track review of "Unapologetic", Andrew Hampp of "Billboard" found the song inspiring and commented that it "finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date". Andy Kellman of Allmusic cited the song as one of the highlights on "Unapologetic", and gave it three and a half stars.

In a less enthusiastic critique, Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" likened "Diamonds" to a "<a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a>" movie theme song, but with "insipid lyrics". Jim Farber of the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">New York Daily News</a>" felt that the song is not as evocative as it attempts to be and lacks the sense of mystery and engaging production found on "We Found Love". Kevin Blair of the "<a href="Irish%20Independent">Irish Independent</a>", Independent Woman, was critical of the song for deviating from Rihanna's previous dance and R&B songs and dismissed it as a "chugging, faintly misty-eyed, middle of the road pop song". Chris Richards of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" panned the song as a "power ballad without much power".

Ernest Baker and Lauren Nostro of "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" ranked "Diamonds" atop their list of The 10 Best Guilty Pleasure Songs of 2012 and wrote that, although the song is unlike Rihanna's louder, more anthemic songs, "apparently the world loves to see a softer side of her, too." <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">Black Entertainment Television</a> placed the single at number six on their 50 Best Songs of 2012 list and called it one of Rihanna's most emotive performances. UK <a href="E%21%20Online">E! Online</a>'s reviewer named it the fifth best song of the year and said that Rihanna's vocal performance on the song validates the attention she had received since her breakthrough with "<a href="Umbrella%20%28song%29">Umbrella</a>". "Irish Independent"s Jim Hayes ranked it as the year's tenth-best song and described it as "a laid back slow burner that invades and refuses to leave". A reviewer from "The Huffington Post" named "Diamonds" one of The 12 Best Songs by Women in 2012.

At the ASCAP Pop Music Awards, the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Publishers">American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers</a> (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2013 and 2014 respectively. "Diamonds" received the "Billboard" accolade for Top R&B Song at the <a href="2013%20Billboard%20Music%20Awards">2013 award ceremony</a> held at the <a href="MGM%20Grand%20Garden%20Arena">MGM Grand Garden Arena</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a>. At the <a href="BET%20Awards%202013">2013 BET Awards</a>, the song was nominated for the <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> <a href="BET%20Award%20for%20Viewer%27s%20Choice">Viewer's Choice</a> accolade, however, it lost to "<a href="Started%20from%20the%20Bottom">Started from the Bottom</a>" by <a href="Drake%20%28rapper%29">Drake</a>. It also received nominations for Best International Song at the <a href="NRJ%20Music%20Award">NRJ Music Award</a>s of 2013 in France and for Hit of the Year at the <a href="2013%20Echo%20Awards">2013 Echo Awards</a> in Germany. "Diamonds" received a nomination for <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Song">Best Song</a> at the <a href="2013%20MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards">2013 MTV Europe Music Awards</a>.

In the US, "Diamonds" debuted at number 16 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and sold 133,000 copies in its first week. In its fourth week, it climbed to number eight on the chart and became Rihanna's twenty-third top-ten single. For the week ending December 1, 2012, the song became Rihanna's twelfth number-one on the chart, which ended the nine-week reign of <a href="Maroon%205">Maroon 5</a>'s "<a href="One%20More%20Night%20%28Maroon%205%20song%29">One More Night</a>". With the feat, Rihanna tied <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> and <a href="Supremes">Supremes</a> as the <a href="List%20of%20Billboard%20Hot%20100%20chart%20achievements%20and%20milestones%23Most%20number-one%20singles">artists with the fifth-most number ones</a> in the chart's history. Rihanna also passed <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a> as the female artist to mark 12 number-one songs the fastest on the chart by achieving the feat in six years and seven months, which bested Carey's stretch of seven years, one month, and two weeks. "Diamonds" charted for a second consecutive week atop the Hot 100, while her album "Unapologetic" topped the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. As a result, Rihanna became only the second artist of 2012 to top both the "Billboard" singles and albums charts simultaneously; the first to do so was English singer <a href="Adele">Adele</a>.

On the <a href="Radio%20Songs">Radio Songs</a> chart, "Diamonds" debuted at number 28. In its fourth week, it climbed to number ten, becoming Rihanna's 19th top ten, breaking a tie with <a href="Lil%20Wayne">Lil Wayne</a> for the second-best sum in the list's 22-year history; only Mariah Carey (23) has more. For the issue dated December 15, the song topped the chart, becoming Rihanna's tenth number one and placing second for female artists with the most chart toppers, only behind Mariah Carey (11). On the <a href="Pop%20Songs">Pop Songs</a> chart, "Diamonds" debuted at number 29, extending Rihanna's lead as the artist with the most appearances on the chart. On October 11, 2012, "Billboard" unveiled new methodology for the <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> chart, newly factoring digital download sales and streaming data into the 50-position rankings, along with existing radio airplay data monitored by <a href="Nielsen%20BDS">Nielsen BDS</a>. Due to this, "Diamonds" saw a huge leap from number 66 to number one, marking Rihanna's second single as a lead artist to top the chart; it topped the chart for fourteen consecutive weeks.

Rihanna began to film the <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "Diamonds" on October 21, 2012, at the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a> in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20California">Lancaster, California</a>. It was directed by her regular collaborator <a href="Anthony%20Mandler">Anthony Mandler</a>, who previously directed her videos for "<a href="Russian%20Roulette%20%28song%29">Russian Roulette</a>" (2009) and "<a href="Man%20Down%20%28song%29">Man Down</a>" (2011). Photographs of the production leaked to the press the same day and showed Rihanna in a white and black dress in front of a fire. Ethan Sacks of the "New York Daily News" remarked that she "looked like a gem on the set of her video shoot." Rihanna said that she wanted the video's abstract scenes to capture the appropriate emotion for the audience. Mandler sought to create a "wider landscape" by suggesting and transfiguring ideas for viewers through the video: "[T]hey needed to feel like dream vignettes, like, when you wake up from a dream, you realize what you were dreaming about is not really what it was about, it was about something else." He also tried to relate the video's concept to Rihanna's personal life: "What's truth or fiction? You know 'Is she drowning, or is she in complete ecstasy? Are those hands coming apart, or are they finding each other?' ... we tried to bring up these deeper questions that relate to song and her life and finding beauty in chaos and finding beauty in pain and finding pain in beauty." On November 7, a behind-the-scenes video was posted on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s official website. It featured Rihanna in a "leopard-print" robe as she emerged from a trailer and headed to the shooting set. The scenes were intercut with police officers who chase armed fighters. Rihanna stands in a deserted landscape in the video's other scenes. The music video for "Diamonds" premiered November 8 on MTV. The video was also made available for <a href="streaming%20media">streaming</a> at Rihanna.MTV.com. It was digitally released on November 14 via the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>.

The music video opens with a view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of diamonds being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut – a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in <a href="Backwards%20masking">reverse effect</a>. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from what appears to be the headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an <a href="Aurora%20%28astronomy%29">aurora</a> view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.

James Montgomery of MTV News called it visually striking and observed a great deal of "evocative imagery (glamorous black-and-white close-ups, thick plumes of translucent smoke, oversaturated hill-scapes, artfully silhouetted stallions)". He said that, like the song, the video is by turns garish and very intimate. The website's Jocelyn Vena thought that it had dreamlike and surrealistic images of Rihanna, who moves through set-ups that are occasionally exceptional. E! Online's Bruna Nessif said that the video shows an abundance of elaborate imagery, narratives, and especially a "mysterious and sexy" Rihanna. Additionally, she found it obvious that the body of a heavily tattooed man's arm, which Rihanna clings to desperately, is a reference to Chris Brown. "<a href="NME">NME</a>" magazine observed Rihanna being shown in four environments that represent the <a href="Classical%20element">four elements</a> of the earth, air, water and fire. Billy Johnson Jr. of <a href="Yahoo%21%20Canada">Yahoo! Canada</a> felt the video had failed to capture the song's vivid celebration of a love affair and stated, "It seems as though [Rihanna is] in chaos, reflecting on happier times." Marc Hogan of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" concluded that the video was a "confirmation of Rihanna's awkward segue into adult-contemporary-dom." The video for "Diamonds" was <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a>'s fourth most-viewed visual of 2013.

Rihanna first performed "Diamonds" on November 7, 2012, at the <a href="Victoria%27s%20Secret%20Fashion%20Show">Victoria's Secret Fashion Show</a>, where she wore black lingerie with black thigh high stockings and ankle boots; the show was aired by <a href="CBS">CBS</a> on December 4. On November 10, Rihanna performed the song on "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>". "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine's Joe Reid said that her performance was the highlight of the show's episode and favored the digitized background in particular, which he described as "overt weirdness" that was ultimately "pretty endearing". Tess Lynch of <a href="Grantland.com">Grantland</a> was impressed by Rihanna's "exceptional singing" and wrote that the background imagery was a "powerful" and "crazy spectacle that astonished viewers". Lynch agreed with episode host <a href="Anne%20Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a>, who had said that Rihanna was "a goddess." "Diamonds" was included on the <a href="set%20list">set list</a> for Rihanna's 2012 promotional tour, the <a href="777%20Tour">777 Tour</a>. 

On November 25, the singer performed the song on <a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%20series%209%29">series 9</a> of "The X Factor" in the UK. The performance featured the singer dressed in a black gown on a square platform. As the chorus began, water effects poured down around her on the outside of the stage. By the final chorus, the water centered into the platform and wet the singer. Hayes of "Irish Independent" praised the performance and stated that it "put everything – and everybody – else to shame." On December 8, Rihanna performed the song on "<a href="Wetten%2C%20dass..%3F">Wetten, dass..?</a>" (""Wanna bet that..?"") in Germany. She also performed "Diamonds" on "La Chanson de l'année" (""The song of the Year"") in France, on December 10, 2012, which was broadcast on December 29, 2012. The single was included as the closing song on the set list of Rihanna's fifth worldwide tour titled the <a href="Diamonds%20World%20Tour">Diamonds World Tour</a> (2013).

Rihanna performed "Diamonds" at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202013">2013 American Music Awards</a> on November 24, 2013, during the acceptance of the <a href="American%20Music%20Award%20for%20Icon">Icon Award</a>. The performance featured the singer wearing a long black dress plunged down to her navel and diamond adornments in her hair. She was joined by an orchestra that included a conductor which accompanied her as a rock band produced the beat. Kory Grow of "Rolling Stone" magazine labeled the performance as "stunning". Additionally, out of a total sixteen performances at the ceremony, he placed Rihanna's rendition of "Diamonds" at number one writing, "she gave a performance that showed she could live up to the honor". "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>"' Mikael Wood stated that during the performance Rihanna dominated the stage pointing that she looked like a young version of <a href="Grace%20Jones">Grace Jones</a>. The single was included on the set list of Rihanna's joint 2014 tour with rapper <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a>, <a href="The%20Monster%20Tour%20%28Eminem%20and%20Rihanna%29">The Monster Tour</a>.

On <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>'s live lounge, <a href="Jessie%20Ware">Jessie Ware</a> performed a slightly jazzy version of the song, which "Spin" magazine's Marc Hogan said was musically reminiscent of <a href="the%20xx">the xx</a> and vocally similar to <a href="D%27Angelo">D'Angelo</a>. Sia Furler, who co-wrote "Diamonds", performed it with a keyboard accompaniment at the Norwegian-American Achievement Ceremony on November 18. On November 15, American singer-songwriter <a href="Zola%20Jesus">Zola Jesus</a> recorded a cover version of "Diamonds". "Diamonds" was used in the promotional video of <a href="Istanbul%20bid%20for%20the%202020%20Summer%20Olympics">Istanbul's bid</a> for the <a href="2020%20Summer%20Olympics">2020 Summer Olympics</a>.

Constance Stokes

Constance Stokes (née Parkin, 22 February 1906 – 14 July 1991) was a modernist Australian painter who worked in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. She trained at the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria%20Art%20School">National Gallery of Victoria Art School</a> until 1929, winning a scholarship to continue her study at London's <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a>. Although Stokes painted few works in the 1930s, her paintings and drawings were exhibited from the 1940s onwards. She was one of only two women, and two Victorians, included in a major exhibition of twelve Australian artists that travelled to Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy in the early 1950s.

Influenced by <a href="George%20Bell%20%28painter%29">George Bell</a>, Stokes was part of the Melbourne Contemporary Artists, a group Bell established in 1940. Her works continued to be well-regarded for many years after the group's formation, in contrast to those by many of her Victorian modernist colleagues, with favourable reviews from critics such as Sir <a href="Philip%20Hendy">Philip Hendy</a> in the United Kingdom and <a href="Bernard%20William%20Smith">Bernard William Smith</a> in Australia.

Her husband's early death in 1962 forced Stokes to return to painting as a career, resulting in a successful one-woman show in 1964, her first in thirty years. She continued to paint and exhibit through the 1970s and 1980s, and was the subject of a retrospective exhibition that toured Victorian regional galleries including <a href="Swan%20Hill%20Regional%20Art%20Gallery">Swan Hill Regional Art Gallery</a> and <a href="Geelong%20Art%20Gallery">Geelong Art Gallery</a> in 1985. She died in 1991 and is little-known in comparison to some other women artists including <a href="Grace%20Cossington%20Smith">Grace Cossington Smith</a> and <a href="Clarice%20Beckett">Clarice Beckett</a>, but her fortunes were revived somewhat as a central figure in <a href="Anne%20Summers">Anne Summers</a>' 2009 book "The Lost Mother". Her art is represented in most major Australian galleries, including the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> and the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>; the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a> is the only significant Australian collecting institution not to hold one of her works.

Constance Parkin was born in 1906 in the hamlet of Miram, near <a href="Nhill%2C%20Victoria">Nhill</a> in western <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. The family moved to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in 1920, where she completed her schooling at <a href="Genazzano%20FCJ%20College">Genazzano convent</a> in the suburb of <a href="Kew%2C%20Victoria">Kew</a>. Constance was short, just under five feet tall, and had dark hair. She trained between 1925 and 1929 at the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria%20Art%20School">National Gallery of Victoria Art School</a> in Melbourne. Over the summer of 1925–1926 the Gallery held a competition for its students, who were asked to paint "holiday subjects"; Constance won the prize for a landscape. The competition was judged by artist <a href="George%20Bell%20%28painter%29">George Bell</a>, who would have a continuing influence over her artistic career.

In 1930, Stokes was among artists who exhibited at a Melbourne gallery, the <a href="Melbourne%20Athenaeum">Athenaeum</a>. Her painting, "Portrait of Mrs. W. Mortill", was one of only two to draw praise from prominent member of the <a href="Heidelberg%20School">Heidelberg School</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Streeton">Arthur Streeton</a>, who described the work as a "rare attraction" that was "liquid and luminous". At the end of her studies, Stokes won the National Gallery of Victoria Art School's prestigious National Gallery Travelling Scholarship, which allowed her to continue her training at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> in London. In addition to her education at the Royal Academy, she studied under the French <a href="cubism">cubist</a> painter and sculptor <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Lhote">André Lhote</a> in Paris in 1932. The following year she returned to Australia, where she married businessman Eric Stokes. The family settled in <a href="Collins%20Street%2C%20Melbourne">Collins Street, Melbourne</a>, and Stokes had three children between 1937 and 1942. In later years, Stokes had a studio in the family home in <a href="Toorak%2C%20Victoria">Toorak</a>, a modernist house designed by architect Edward Billson.

Stokes returned from a European honeymoon in 1934, but she produced few works in the years immediately following. Although the Collins Street apartment had become a full-time studio for Stokes, only two paintings and two sketches from the period are known. The most notable is "The Village" (c.1933–1935), influenced, according to Stokes' own account, by the <a href="Post-Impressionism">post-impressionist</a> and portraitist <a href="Augustus%20John">Augustus John</a>. This work was hung in the inaugural exhibition of the Contemporary Art Society, held at the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>. It was included in a travelling exhibition that appeared in New York's <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in 1941 and later in Canada. In 1946, Stokes presented the work to the National Gallery of Victoria.
In the mid-twentieth century, there were divisions in the Melbourne art scene, which became intertwined with the complex cultural politics of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era. In the late 1940s, there was a move against <a href="modern%20art">modernism</a> in art, and <a href="tonalism">tonalism</a> came into favour. Partly as a reaction to this development, artist George Bell established an exhibiting group called the Melbourne Contemporary Artists in 1940. Bell was a former war artist and influential member of the Victorian artistic establishment, who after World War II was appointed to teach at the National Gallery of Victoria's painting school. Influenced by Bell, Stokes was among the artists for whom modernism was a strong influence, and who exhibited with the Melbourne Contemporary Artists. Other members of the group included <a href="Russell%20Drysdale">Russell Drysdale</a> and <a href="Sali%20Herman">Sali Herman</a>.

Stokes' artistry endured, while that of some of her modernist colleagues did not. By 1945, when the Melbourne Contemporary Artists held one of their exhibitions, art critic Alan McCulloch observed that the works were increasingly lacking in originality and that the former standards of the group were being maintained by only a few members. One of those was Stokes, whose work "The Family" he praised as "strongly designed and sensitively modelled". The following year, though, McCulloch was more upbeat, describing the show as their best to date, while again complementing Stokes on her "rich and opulent pictures". Six years later, when the group exhibited in 1952, the critic for Melbourne's "<a href="The%20Argus%20%28Melbourne%29">Argus</a>" was as unimpressed as had been McCulloch in 1945. Suggesting that the show demonstrated that Melbourne's art scene lacked innovation, he nevertheless singled out a small number of works for praise. One of these was Stokes' "Christ with Simon and Andrew", which he thought showed "richness and feeling".

While Stokes was being praised at home in Melbourne, one of her portraits was among six paintings owned by the National Gallery of Victoria that were loaned for an exhibition on the other side of the country, in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>. The city's newspaper, "<a href="The%20West%20Australian">The West Australian</a>", chose Stokes' picture to illustrate its story on the exhibition. Calling it "Girl Drying Her Hair", the paper described the work as "notable for its patient handling, use of bright colour and skilful blending of figure and background". The National Gallery of Victoria refers to the work as "Woman Drying Her Hair", which it had acquired in 1947 at the behest of curator and artist <a href="Daryl%20Lindsay">Daryl Lindsay</a>. It was soon to travel a great deal further than to Perth.

In 1953, at the request of Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> and the <a href="British%20Arts%20Council">British Arts Council</a>, an exhibition of the works of twelve Australian artists was assembled. It was shown in London, five regional British cities, and at the <a href="Venice%20Biennale">Venice Biennale</a>. Of the twelve artists selected for inclusion, only two were from Victoria, the rest being from New South Wales; Stokes was one of the Victorians. Her three works, including "Woman Drying Her Hair", hung alongside those of Australia's most prominent mid-twentieth-century artists, including <a href="Arthur%20Boyd">Arthur Boyd</a>, Russell Drysdale, <a href="William%20Dobell">William Dobell</a>, <a href="Sidney%20Nolan">Sidney Nolan</a>, <a href="Lloyd%20Rees">Lloyd Rees</a>, <a href="Donald%20Friend">Donald Friend</a> and <a href="Frank%20Hinder">Frank Hinder</a>. Despite these prominent painters being selected for inclusion, when the exhibition appeared in London, Stokes' "<a href="Girl%20in%20Red%20Tights">Girl in Red Tights</a>" drew critical attention and acclaim. Admired by the director of the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> Sir <a href="Philip%20Hendy">Philip Hendy</a>, the work was proclaimed by the art critic at "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as the "best picture in London that week". Some artists in Sydney were not so impressed. A meeting of the Royal Art Society of New South Wales urged Prime Minister Menzies to intervene, members describing the paintings as "the worst ever gathered in one place". However, the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board member who announced the exhibition considered that it would represent the most substantial promotion Australian art would have experienced to that time. The following year, Joseph Burke, Professor of Fine Arts at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, praised Stokes' painting, making particular reference to her work that had so entranced viewers at the 1953 exhibition. "Constance Stokes", he wrote, was a painter who "announced the pursuit of the classical ideal as [her] aim. [Her] "Girl in Red Tights", with its Venetian richness of colouring, ably sustains the monumental harmony of the classical tradition."

Religious subjects appear regularly in Stokes' paintings; one such work, "The Baptism", is in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. Despite her recurring attention to such subjects, however, the artist entered the <a href="Blake%20Prize%20for%20Religious%20Art">Blake Prize for Religious Art</a> only once, in 1953. <a href="Esmond%20George">Esmond George</a>, critic at <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> newspaper "The Mail", admired the (unidentified) work as having "strong art interest". Stokes' interest in the Prize was not so strong as to prompt her to enter again. She told an interviewer that "abstract painting took over".

Eric Stokes died unexpectedly in 1962, an experience which left Constance bereft; a long-time friend said that she never really recovered. Faced with a substantial mortgage to service, Stokes returned to work: painting. Two years later, she opened her first one-woman show in over thirty years. It comprised 43 works, with the 27 paintings priced dearly, at upwards of 150 <a href="guineas">guineas</a>. The exhibition was a success both financially and critically: Stokes earned over 4000 guineas, and the exhibition attracted praise from art historian and critic <a href="Bernard%20William%20Smith">Bernard William Smith</a>. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she painted and held shows; this later phase of her work was based on a stronger, if lighter, colour palette and reflected the influence of the art of <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>, whom Stokes admired. There was also a change in her subject matter, from "classically conceived" still lifes, groups of figures and nudes, to more decorative themes. Stokes' works continued to be well received, having been included in the 1975 exhibition "Australian women artists" at the University of Melbourne, and the Regional Galleries Association of Victoria's 1977 touring exhibition "The heroic years of Australian painting, 1940–1965". Stokes' last painting was "Alice Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole", painted around 1989; she died in Melbourne in 1991.

The standard reference work, "McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art", describes Stokes as "a leading figure in the modernist movement in Victoria". Not all critics regard Stokes' work so favourably, however. Art historian Christopher Heathcote acknowledges the recognition of Stokes' work by her contemporaries, but goes on to say that "strong staff support [at Melbourne University] for a few lesser practitioners, such as Constance Stokes ... hardly aided the appreciation of the better local work." Though she appears in McCulloch's guide, few other reviews of Australian art recognise Stokes. Exceptions, according to feminist writer <a href="Anne%20Summers">Anne Summers</a>, include <a href="Ursula%20Hoff">Ursula Hoff</a>'s "Masterpieces of the National Gallery of Victoria" and <a href="Janine%20Burke">Janine Burke</a>'s "Australian Women Artists. One Hundred Years 1840–1940", both of which refer to the well-travelled painting "Woman Drying Her Hair". While academic artists and art historians such as Bernard William Smith and Joseph Burke praised Stokes' work during her lifetime, she faded into relative obscurity. There is, however, a strong <a href="secondary%20market">market for resale</a> of her works.

Stokes returned to some prominence through a book by Anne Summers, published in 2009, called "The Lost Mother", in which Stokes and her paintings are central to a narrative about Summers' own family. Summers contrasts Stokes' ongoing obscurity with the dramatic resurrection of the oeuvre of artists <a href="Grace%20Cossington%20Smith">Grace Cossington Smith</a> and <a href="Clarice%20Beckett">Clarice Beckett</a>, both brought to attention by well-regarded gallery curators. Summers considers a number of factors to be involved in Stokes' fate, including her association with George Bell, whose destruction of many of his early pictures, propensity to keep reworking his old pieces, and artistic conservatism, all limited his subsequent reputation. Summers also points to the lack of a high-profile champion of Stokes' work, and her Melbournian identity in a time when "Sydney was where the ideas and the experimentation were and the place where reputations were made". Historian Helen Topliss takes a slightly different view, emphasising that Stokes was "deflected" from her career by raising a family.

A retrospective exhibition of Stokes' paintings toured Victorian regional galleries including <a href="Swan%20Hill%20Regional%20Gallery">Swan Hill Regional Gallery</a> and <a href="Geelong%20Art%20Gallery">Geelong Art Gallery</a> in 1985. The next year, an exhibition of her work toured several state galleries and the S.H. Irvin gallery in Sydney. In 1992, her works were displayed in the National Gallery of Victoria's exhibition "Classical Modernism: The George Bell Circle", while in 1993 the same gallery curated an exhibition of her paintings and drawings.

Most major Australian collections hold works by Stokes: "The Village" is one of thirteen in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. Closely associated with Victoria, and in particular the cultural milieu of Melbourne, Stokes is well represented in the galleries of that state. These include the <a href="Ballarat%20Fine%20Art%20Gallery">Ballarat Fine Art Gallery</a>, <a href="Benalla%20Art%20Gallery">Benalla Art Gallery</a>, Geelong Art Gallery, <a href="Mornington%20Peninsula%20Regional%20Gallery">Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery</a>, and Swan Hill Regional Gallery. Other public galleries holding works by Stokes include the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>, the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20South%20Australia">Art Gallery of South Australia</a>, the <a href="Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory</a>, and the <a href="Queensland%20Art%20Gallery">Queensland Art Gallery</a>. The <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a> is alone among the major Australian institutions in not holding any of her paintings or drawings.

Oliver Bosbyshell

Oliver Christian Bosbyshell (January 3, 1839 – August 1, 1921) was Superintendent of the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> at Philadelphia from 1889 to 1894. He also claimed to have been the first <a href="Union%20Army">Union soldier</a> wounded by enemy action in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, stating that he received a bruise on the forehead from an object thrown by a <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> sympathizer while his unit was marching through Baltimore in April 1861.

Bosbyshell was born in Mississippi. His parents were of old Philadelphia stock, and he was raised in <a href="Schuylkill%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania</a>. After briefly working on the railroad and then studying law, Bosbyshell enlisted in the Union cause on the outbreak of war. Following a brief period of service in the 25th Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment, he joined the <a href="48th%20Pennsylvania%20Infantry">48th Pennsylvania</a>, remaining in that regiment for three years. He saw action in such battles as <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Bull Run</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Antietam</a>. He rose to the rank of <a href="major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> and led his regiment, but was mustered out upon the expiration of his term of service in October 1864, having been refused a leave of absence.

After leaving the army, Bosbyshell returned to Pennsylvania and worked in two unsuccessful businesses; he also involved himself in Republican politics and in the activities of the <a href="Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic">Grand Army of the Republic</a>, a veterans' group. He was appointed to a post at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> in 1869, and became chief coiner in 1876 and superintendent in 1889, serving for four years. One of Bosbyshell's underlings at the mint stole gold bars and, as they were not all recovered when the culprit was arrested, Bosbyshell was held responsible for the loss by virtue of his office. He was absolved of this liability by act of Congress in 1899. In his later years, he was an officer of an insurance company; he died in 1921.

Oliver Christian Bosbyshell was born in <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>, on January 3, 1839, the son of Oliver Christian and Mary Ann (Whitney) Bosbyshell. Both his parents were from old Philadelphia families; the couple had taken up temporary residence in Vicksburg. The senior Oliver Bosbyshell was engaged in the commission business. He contracted bronchitis while fighting a fire that destroyed his warehouse, and died in Philadelphia after a sea voyage taken in the hope of recovering his health. Eight weeks later, his son was born, and Mary Bosbyshell returned from Mississippi with him to her father's house in <a href="Schuylkill%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania</a>. Young Oliver grew up there, and attended local public schools. At age 15, he left school to become a telegraph messenger and for the next three years took various jobs in that field before deciding to pursue a career in the law. He first studied with attorney Francis W. Hugbee, then with his uncle, William Whitney; both were in <a href="Pottsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pottsville</a>. He was still engaged as a student in 1861, when the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> broke out.

On April 15, 1861, President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> called for 50,000 volunteers to fight to preserve the Union. The following day, Bosbyshell joined the Washington Artillerists, a local militia company, which quickly set out for Washington. En route, the company had to march through the streets of Baltimore on April 17. A hostile crowd of Confederate sympathizers gathered; according to accounts in his lifetime, he was struck by a missile variously described as a stone or a brick. Although it gave him a large bruise and momentarily stunned him, the object drew no blood; Private Bosbyshell was purportedly the first man wounded in the Union cause, while an African-American servant, hit a few minutes later by a missile which broke the skin, was deemed the first man to have shed his blood for the Union. However, official records do not list Bosbyshell among the casualties of the <a href="Baltimore%20riot%20of%201861">Baltimore riots</a>.

In Washington, the company was quartered in the Ladies' Gallery of the Senate Chamber, in <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">the Capitol</a>. The 350 Pennsylvania troops who first reached Washington on April 18 became known as the First Defenders and, after the war, the survivors formed an association with that name. While they were lodged at the Capitol, President Lincoln, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a> visited. Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln, "yes, here, towering over all in the room was the great central figure of the war. I remember how I was impressed by the kindliness of his face and awkward hanging of his arms and legs, his apparent bashfulness in the presence of these first soldiers of the Republic, and with it all a grave, rather mournful bearing in his attitude."

The Washington Artillerists were redesignated as Company H of the 25th Pennsylvania Volunteers, and were sent down the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> to <a href="Fort%20Washington%20%28Maryland%29">Fort Washington</a>, where the company spent three months strengthening the fortifications. Bosbyshell was offered a <a href="First%20lieutenant">first lieutenancy</a> in the regular Army, which he declined, stating that he preferred volunteer service. When the company's term of enlistment expired, Bosbyshell rejoined Union forces as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in Company G, <a href="48th%20Pennsylvania%20Infantry">48th Pennsylvania Volunteers</a>, to serve a three-year term from October 1, 1861.
For about a month after his re-enlistment, Bosbyshell was regimental recruiting officer in Harrisburg, but on November 11, sailed with his regiment from <a href="Fortress%20Monroe">Fortress Monroe</a>, Virginia, to <a href="Hatteras%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hatteras, North Carolina</a>. There he served as acting adjutant of his regiment, and as <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%27s%20Corps%2C%20United%20States%20Army">judge advocate</a> for <a href="court-martial">courts-martial</a>. When General <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a> launched an <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Bern">attack on New Bern</a>, he took six companies of the 48th with him, as well as Bosbyshell, though Company G was not included among the Union forces. In April and May 1862, Bosbyshell received successive promotions to first lieutenant and <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a> and was assigned to command his company, which he did at such battles as <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Bull Run</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Antietam</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Fredericksburg</a>. After Fredericksburg, he was again assigned to serve in courts-martial; when the regiment was moved west in early 1863, Bosbyshell was assigned as <a href="provost%20marshal">provost marshal</a> of <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>. While stationed at Louisville, he returned home to Pennsylvania on leave of absence to marry Martha Stem, daughter of a minister.

When the regiment was ordered to Tennessee in September 1863 to take part in Union actions there, Bosbyshell was made Acting Assistant Adjutant-General for the First Brigade of the Ninth Corps, of which the 48th was part. He fought at <a href="Battle%20of%20Blue%20Springs">Blue Springs</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Campbell%27s%20Station">Campbell's Station</a>, and took part in the <a href="Knoxville%20Campaign">siege of Knoxville</a>. In 1864, he returned to Pennsylvania again to help bring the regiment up to strength. Returning to his brigade post, he commanded African-American troops in the <a href="Wilderness%20Campaign">Wilderness Campaign</a>.

On July 10, 1864, Bosbyshell was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> and ordered to command the 48th, though he remained at his brigade post temporarily. At this time, Union forces were <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">besieging Petersburg</a>, south of the Confederate capital, <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. The acting commander of the 48th, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Henry%20Pleasants">Henry Pleasants</a>, in civilian life a mining engineer, conceived the idea of digging under the Confederate lines and exploding a giant bomb. After weeks of preparation, the bomb was exploded on July 30, creating a huge pit in the ground and a hole in the Confederate lines. After initial shock, the Confederates rallied and repulsed the attempt to break the lines, aided by Union bungling. Bosbyshell led African-American troops into action in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Crater">Battle of the Crater</a>; they suffered over 400 casualties. With Pleasants promoted to General <a href="Robert%20B.%20Potter">Robert B. Potter</a>'s staff, Bosbyshell took command of the 48th on August 2, 1864.

Bosbyshell led his command at <a href="Battle%20of%20Globe%20Tavern">Globe Tavern</a> and at <a href="Battle%20of%20Peebles%27s%20Farm">Peebles's Farm</a>. In September 1864, he sought leave of absence to return to Pennsylvania on personal business. When this was refused, and with his three-year term of service having expired, he was mustered out on October 1, 1864.

Having returned to Pottsville, Bosbyshell entered first the banking business, and then the book and stationary trade, each time with "disastrous" results. A <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, he ran for <a href="prothonotary%23Chief%20court%20clerk">prothonotary</a> of Schuylkill County in 1866, but was defeated.

Shortly after the war, the <a href="Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic">Grand Army of the Republic</a> (GAR), a Union veteran's group, was founded. During Bosbyshell's campaign to become prothonotary, he was asked to organize the Schuylkill County branch, but declined because of his status as a candidate. The following year, however, he joined the GAR, organizing Post 24 in Pottsville. He became Schuylkill County district commander of the GAR soon after, and in 1869 was elected Pennsylvania's GAR department commander.

In 1869, Bosbyshell was hired as Register of Deposits of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, and moved to that city. The Chief Coiner, <a href="A.%20Loudon%20Snowden">A. Loudon Snowden</a>, was impressed by Bosbyshell, and promoted him to Assistant Coiner in 1872. When Snowden left the Mint to accept a position as postmaster in 1876, President <a href="Ulysses%20Grant">Ulysses Grant</a> promoted Bosbyshell in his place. Grant nominated Bosbyshell on December 14, 1876; he was confirmed by the Senate on December 26. According to numismatic historian <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, Bosbyshell, while serving as Chief Coiner, used Mint facilities and out-of-date dies to strike rare <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a>s, including the 1873, 1875, and 1876 issues. During Bosbyshell's tenure, quantities of pattern coins, restrikes, and pieces struck in different metals flowed to well-connected collectors and dealers, and Bosbyshell sold a large personal collection of such pieces shortly after leaving office.

Bosbyshell served as Chief Coiner until early 1885; with the approaching advent of the <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%23First%20term%20as%20president%20%281885%E2%80%931889%29">first Cleveland administration</a>, Democrats would be appointed as Mint officials, and Bosbyshell secured a position as chief clerk in the Philadelphia City Controller's office. Bosbyshell was hired, despite the fact that he was a Republican in a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a>-run municipal administration, because of his friendship with Controller Robert Dechert.

Having maintained his involvement in the GAR, Bosbyshell was in charge of the committee on arrangements for the Tenth National Encampment of the GAR, at Philadelphia in 1876. In 1879, he was elected as commander of Post 2 in that city. He also joined the Second Regiment of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20National%20Guard">Pennsylvania National Guard</a>, and was elected major in 1878 and lieutenant colonel in 1880.

On October 17, 1889, President <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> commissioned Bosbyshell as superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint. As the Senate was not sitting, Bosbyshell received a <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a>. Bosbyshell filed his oath of office on November 1, 1889. On his first day on the job, he was greeted with a bouquet of flowers and a large pile of mail from office-seekers. He gave receipts for the Mint property he was now responsible for, and found no errors in the accounts of his predecessor. On December 16, 1889, with the Senate in session, Harrison nominated Bosbyshell. The following day, Vermont Senator <a href="Justin%20Morrill">Justin Morrill</a>, on behalf of the Senate Finance Committee, to which Bosbyshell's nomination had been referred, recommended that he be confirmed. The Senate did so on December 19.

In 1890, Bosbyshell deposited $4,200 of federal funds in the Keystone National Bank, which then went bankrupt. Bosbyshell was responsible for the debt, which was only $300 less than his annual salary, and paid it off by stages, completing the payments in 1894. In August 1890, Bosbyshell was elected colonel of his National Guard regiment; the vote was unexpectedly close, as he was disliked by some of his fellow officers. Following the <a href="Homestead%20Riots">Homestead Riots</a> in July 1892, Pennsylvania Governor <a href="Robert%20E.%20Pattison">Robert E. Pattison</a> ordered militia to the strike-torn town to restore order. Bosbyshell led his guard regiment to <a href="Homestead%2C%20Pennsylvania">Homestead</a>, where the strikers offered no resistance. In August 1893, he resigned from the regiment.
Before <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Congress abolished the practice</a> in 1873, the government made silver <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> alongside gold. This led to one of the great political controversies of the late 1800s, as many called for a return to pre-1873 laws, which would require the government to take all the silver offered it and then return it, struck into silver dollars. On January 3, 1891, two "<a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>" advocates called at the Philadelphia Mint with a large ingot of silver, and asked for it to be coined. When the weighing clerk declined, they asked to see Bosbyshell, who received them, but refused their demand. He did, however, write at their request a letter stating that the laws forbade coinage of silver provided by the public.

Bosbyshell was Mint Superintendent while the Mint created new coin designs, including the <a href="Barber%20coinage">Barber coinage</a>, <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">Columbian half dollar</a>, and <a href="Isabella%20quarter">Isabella quarter</a>. In the case of the quarter, issued in 1893, Bosbyshell was involved in the consultations within the Mint over the design, and sent a letter to Caroline Peddle, who was initially hired to design the piece, requiring that the image of <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile">Queen Isabella</a> on the coin not wear a crown. Soon after, Peddle withdrew from the project.

Cleveland was elected for a second non-consecutive term in November 1892. With the Democrats in power again, new Mint Director <a href="Robert%20E.%20Preston">Robert Preston</a> in late March 1894 ordered Bosbyshell to turn over the Philadelphia Mint to his successor, Dr. Eugene Townsend. This required the counting of every coin in the facility, including cents and nickels. After consulting with the sureties on his bond as superintendent, Bosbyshell objected to resigning until the count (expected to take three months) was complete, but nevertheless left office as directed on March 31, 1894.

Bosbyshell had been elected vice-president of the Fidelity National Life Insurance Company in February 1893; in December of that year he was elected treasurer instead, a post he still held as of 1908. President <a href="William%20McKinley">McKinley</a> appointed him a member of the 1898 <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>.
In September 1893, a major theft at the Philadelphia Mint had been discovered. Henry Cochran, weighing clerk, had been surreptitiously extracting gold bars from a vault sealed in 1887, not with a solid door but with a latticed one that was somewhat loose. Bosbyshell, in taking custody of the Philadelphia Mint's assets from his predecessor, Daniel Fox, had not asked for the gold to be weighed. When the gold was taken out to be converted into coin in 1893, the shortage was discovered. Although some of the gold was recovered, there was still a shortage of $12,810.82, and the government brought suit against Bosbyshell after he left office in 1894, securing judgment against him and the sureties on his bond. Bosbyshell appealed to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Third%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a>, which ruled against him. <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Pennsylvania">The district court</a> had ruled for Bosbyshell on the matter of 733 silver dollars said to be missing, leaving only the question of the gold. Bosbyshell asked for review by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>, but also sought legislative relief, and on February 2, 1899, Congress absolved him of the debt, making the court case moot.

With the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> in 1898, Bosbyshell organized and served as colonel of the Nineteenth Pennsylvania National Guard Regiment, which was used for homeland defense. He remained in that capacity from August 1898 until November 1899.

As well as the GAR, Bosbyshell had many interests and activities. An <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopalian</a>, he was a vestryman of the Church of the Savior in Philadelphia; for many years he conducted the choir and involved himself in <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> work, often as superintendent. He memorialized his regiment's wartime experiences with "The 48th in the War", published in 1895, and was a member of several other veterans societies. He was also chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University Lodge of Masons. Taking an interest in genealogy, around 1910 he published "Descendants of Christian and Elizabeth (Oliver) Bosbyshell 1782–1910".

Oliver Bosbyshell died on August 1, 1921, after suffering a stroke. He was survived by one of his children, Oliver, and by several grandchildren. He had four sons with his wife Martha, who died in 1914; their eldest son Nathan died in Los Angeles in 1888 at age 23.

Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari

Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari (; <a href="EYD">Perfected spelling</a>: Syair Cerita Siti Akbari, Malay for "Poem on the Story of Siti Akbari"; also known as Siti Akbari) is an 1884 <a href="Malay-language">Malay-language</a> "<a href="syair">syair</a>" (poem) by <a href="Lie%20Kim%20Hok">Lie Kim Hok</a>. Adapted indirectly from the "<a href="Sjair%20Abdoel%20Moeloek">Sjair Abdoel Moeloek</a>", it tells of a woman who passes as a man to free her husband from the <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> of Hindustan, who had captured him in an assault on their kingdom.

Written over a period of several years and influenced by European literature, "Siti Akbari" differs from earlier "syairs" in its use of <a href="suspense">suspense</a> and emphasis on prose rather than form. It also incorporates European <a href="Literary%20realism">realist</a> views to expand upon the genre, although it maintains several of the hallmarks of traditional "syairs". Critical views have emphasised various aspects of its story, finding in the work an increased empathy for women's thoughts and feelings, a call for a <a href="lingua%20franca">unifying language</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (now <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>), and a polemic regarding the relation between tradition and modernity.

"Siti Akbari" was a commercial and critical success, seeing two reprints and a <a href="Siti%20Akbari">film adaptation</a> in 1940. When "Sjair Abdoel Moeloek" influence became clear in the 1920s, Lie was criticised as unoriginal. However, "Siti Akbari" remains one of the better known "syairs" written by an ethnic Chinese author. Lie was later styled as the "father of <a href="Chinese%20Malay%20literature">Chinese Malay literature</a>".

The Sultan of Hindustan, Bahar Oedin, is infuriated after his uncle Safi, a trader, dies while imprisoned in Barbari. As the Abdul Aidid, the Sultan of Barbari, has greater military power, Bahar Oedin bides his time and plans his revenge. Meanwhile, Abdul Aidid's son Abdul Moelan marries his cousin, Siti Bida Undara. Two years later, after Abdul Aidid dies, Abdul Moelan goes on an extended sea voyage, leaving his wife behind.

In the nearby kingdom of Ban, Abdul Moelan meets and falls in love with Siti Akbari, daughter of the Sultan of Ban. The two soon marry and, after six months in Ban, return to Barbari. Siti Bida Undara, at first upset at the thought of sharing her husband, soon becomes close friends with Siti Akbari. Shortly thereafter Bahar Oedin takes his revenge, capturing Abdul Moelan and Siti Bida Undara. When the sultan tries to capture Siti Akbari, he discovers a body in her room and believes it to be hers. He takes his captives back to Hindustan and imprisons them.

Unknown to him, the pregnant Siti Akbari has faked her death and escaped. After several months she finds protection under Syaikh (<a href="Sheikh">Sheikh</a>) Khidmatullah, under whose protection she gives birth. He trains her in "<a href="silat">silat</a>" (traditional martial arts) so she can free her husband. Leaving her son in Khidmatullah's care, she begins her travels. When seven men accost and attempt to rape her, she kills them. Taking their clothes and cutting her hair, she disguises herself as a man and takes the name Bahara. After arriving in Barbam, she stops a war between two claimants to the region's throne. She kills the usurper, then takes his head to the rightful heir to the throne, Hamid Lauda. In thanks Hamid Lauda rewards Siti Akbari with rule over Barbam and allows the "Bahara" to take his sister, Siti Abian, in marriage.

Siti Akbari, keeping her disguise as Bahara, leaves Barbam to go to Hindustan and recover her husband. With the help of two advisors who have found the Sultan's disfavour, she is able to reconnoitre the area. She eventually captures Hindustan with her army, conquering the sultanate on her own, killing Bahar Oedin, and freeing Abdul Moelan and Siti Bida Undara. While still disguised, Siti Akbari <a href="repudiate">repudiate</a>s Siti Abian and gives her to Abdul Moelan before revealing her true identity. The different kingdoms are then divided amongst the male protagonists, while Siti Akbari returns to her role as a wife.

"Siti Akbari" was written by <a href="Lie%20Kim%20Hok">Lie Kim Hok</a>, a <a href="Bogor">Bogor</a>-born <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">"peranakan" Chinese</a> who was taught by Dutch missionaries. The missionaries introduced him to European literature, including the works of <a href="Dutch%20literature">Dutch writers</a> such as <a href="Anna%20Louisa%20Geertruida%20Bosboom-Toussaint">Anna Louisa Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint</a> and <a href="Jacob%20van%20Lennep">Jacob van Lennep</a>, as well as works by <a href="French%20literature">French authors</a> like <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>, <a href="Alexandre%20Dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a>, and <a href="Pierre%20Alexis%20Ponson%20du%20Terrail">Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail</a>. In his doctoral thesis, J. Francisco B. Benitez suggests that Lie may have also been influenced by Malay and <a href="Javanese%20language">Javanese</a> <a href="oral%20tradition">oral tradition</a>s, such as the travelling "<a href="bangsawan">bangsawan</a>" theatrical troupes or "<a href="wayang">wayang</a>" puppets.

Evidence uncovered after Lie's death in 1912 suggested that "Siti Akbari" was heavily influenced by the earlier "<a href="Sjair%20Abdoel%20Moeloek">Sjair Abdoel Moeloek</a>" (1847), variously credited to <a href="Raja%20Ali%20Haji">Raja Ali Haji</a> or Saleha. This tale was transliterated by Arnold Snackey, then later translated into <a href="Sundanese%20language">Sundanese</a>. Sources disagree on the translator. The documentarian <a href="Christiaan%20Hooykaas">Christiaan Hooykaas</a>, writing in a letter to literary critic <a href="Nio%20Joe%20Lan">Nio Joe Lan</a>, suggested that Lie's inspiration had come from a version of "Sjair Abdoel Moeloek" held in the <a href="Royal%20Batavian%20Society%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences</a> Library in Batavia. Biographer <a href="Tio%20Ie%20Soei">Tio Ie Soei</a>, meanwhile, suggested that the version which inspired Lie was translated in 1873 by Lie's teacher, <a href="Sierk%20Coolsma">Sierk Coolsma</a>. According to Tio, Coolsma had based his translation off a stage performance and written it hurriedly, such that it was nearly illegible. As he had better handwriting, Lie purportedly copied the story for Coolsma and kept the original in his own collection. The literary historian Monique Zaini-Lajoubert writes that none of these intermediary versions has been found.

Work on "Siti Akbari" was completed over a period of several years. Lie stated that the story had taken him three years, writing sporadically. Tio, however, reports rumours that the writing took some seven years, with Lie sometimes taking long breaks and sometimes writing in a fervor, writing from dawn until dusk.

The literary critic G. Koster writes that, when writing "Siti Akbari", Lie Kim Hok was limited by the formulaic <a href="Panji%20%28prince%29">"Pandji" romances</a> and "<a href="syair">syair</a>" poems common in Malay literature at the time. Koster notes basic structural similarities between "Siti Akbari" and the existing poetic forms. The work followed the <a href="archetype">archetype</a> of a hero or heroine going from a lawful kingdom into exile then into a chaotic kingdom, one which Koster suggests is representative of the cycle of <a href="oral%20law">oral law</a>. Such an archetype and formulas were used in contemporary works such as "<a href="Syair%20Siti%20Zubaidah%20Perang%20Cina">Syair Siti Zubaidah Perang Cina</a>" ("Poem on Siti Zubaidah and the War against China"). The plot device of a woman passing herself as a man to do war was likewise common in <a href="Malay%20literature">Malay</a> and <a href="Javanese%20literature">Javanese literature</a>. Lie deviated greatly from the established traditions, mixing European and <a href="native%20Indonesians">native</a> literary influences.

The story consists of 1,594 <a href="Monorhyme">monorhymic</a> quatrains divided into two <a href="couplet">couplet</a>s, with each couplet consisting of two lines, and each line consisting of two half-lines separated by a <a href="caesura">caesura</a>. Most of these lines are complete syntactic units, either <a href="clause">clause</a>s or <a href="Sentence%20%28linguistics%29">sentences</a>. Koster notes that the form is freer than in more traditional works, and as a result it becomes a sort of <a href="prose%20poem">prose poem</a>. An unnamed narrator tells the story from a <a href="Third-person%20omniscient%20narrative">third-person omniscient</a> perspective; unlike most contemporary works, the narrator "assumes authority on his own account" by putting himself and his ideas forth, rather than acting as an uninvolved party.

"Siti Akbari" differs from contemporary works by introducing a feeling of <a href="suspense">suspense</a>. Koster gives the identity of the Hindustani trader as an example: the man's identity as the uncle of the Sultan is not revealed until after it is convenient for the story. Koster describes the period in which a reader believes Siti Akbari to be dead, which spans several pages, as the work's most remarkable break from tradition. He notes that unlike most contemporary works, the "syair" begins with a quote, rather than an invocation to <a href="Allah">Allah</a>. This quote is eventually shown as a fulfilled prophecy:
Koster sees effects of <a href="Literary%20realism">realism</a>, especially the idealistic realism held at the time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and <a href="causality">causality</a> are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who – although royalty and holy men – were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from <a href="oral%20literature">oral literature</a>. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.

Benitez writes that the market in "Siti Akbari" "provides possibilities for exchange and connections" between persons of all cultures and backgrounds, connecting them. He describes this a representation of the <a href="heteroglossia">heteroglossia</a> offered by <a href="bazaar%20Malay">bazaar Malay</a>, which had originated in the markets. As Lie also wrote <a href="Malajoe%20Batawi">a grammar of bazaar Malay</a>, Benitez suggests that Lie may have hoped for the dialect to become a "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>.

Benitez considers the poem to highlight the tensions between the "monadic and autonomous subjectivity" of European culture and the "social subjectivity" of "<a href="adat">adat</a>", or tradition, with the character of Siti Akbari "a site of instability that makes manifest both the possibilities of social transformation, as well as the anxiety over the possibility of social reproduction gone awry". As an individual, she is able to fight her enemies and reclaim her husband. Ultimately, however, she chooses to return to her polygamous relationship with Abdul Moelan, an affirmation of tradition over modernism. In opposition to Siti Akbari, the trader Safi Oedin refuses to live in accordance with the local customs while he is in a foreign land and ultimately dies. Benitez writes that this "may be read as a warning to those who refuse to live in accordance with local "adat"." Koster notes that – as usual with "syairs" – "Siti Akbari" works to increase awareness of "adat" and traditional value systems.

Zaini-Lajoubert opines that the story promotes a treatment of women as persons with feelings and opinions, as opposed to the <a href="patriarchial">patriarchial</a> view common during the period that women were unfeeling objects. She finds that the story's female characters feel grief and joy, quoting several passages, including one where Siti Akbari confesses that she felt she had waited "dozens of years" for Abdul Moelan. Zaini-Lajoubert notes that the female characters are not all of the same opinion: although Siti Akbari was willing to enter a polygamous relationship, Siti Bida Undara had to be coaxed. Ultimately, however, she finds that "Siti Akbari" conveys the message that women should be faithful and obedient to their husbands.

"Siti Akbari" was first published in four <a href="Volume%20%28publishing%29">volumes</a> in 1884. It proved to be Lie's most popular work, and received the most reprints out of any of his publications. The first reprinting was in 1913 by Hoa Siang In Kiok, and the second was in 1922 by Kho Tjeng Bie. Both of these new printings consisted of a single volume, and, according to Tio, contained numerous inaccuracies.

The story was well received by readers, and although Lie was not the only ethnic Chinese to write in the traditionally Malay poetry form of "syair", he became one of the more accomplished. Lie considered it amongst his best works. Writing in 1923, <a href="Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">Kwee Tek Hoay</a> – himself a proficient author – wrote that he had been fascinated by the story as a child, to the point he had "memorised more than half of its contents by heart". Kwee considered it "full of good maxims and advice" unavailable elsewhere. Nio Joe Lan described it as the "jewel of Chinese Malay poetry", of far higher quality than other Chinese-written Malay poems – both contemporary and subsequent.

The story was adapted for the stage soon after publication, when it was performed by a group named "Siti Akbari" under Lie's leadership. Lie also made a simplified version for a troupe of teenaged actors, whom he led in Bogor. In 1922 the <a href="Sukabumi">Sukabumi</a> branch of the Shiong Tih Hui published another stage adaptation under the title "Pembalesan Siti Akbari" ("Revenge of Siti Akbari"); by 1926 it was being performed by <a href="Miss%20Riboet%27s%20Orion">Miss Riboet's Orion</a>, a theatrical troupe led by <a href="Tio%20Tek%20Djien">Tio Tek Djien</a>. The story remained popular well into the late 1930s. It likely inspired <a href="Wong%20brothers">Joshua and Othniel Wong</a>'s 1940 film "<a href="Siti%20Akbari">Siti Akbari</a>", starring <a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a> and <a href="Rd.%20Mochtar">Rd. Mochtar</a>. The extent of this influence is uncertain, and the film is likely lost.

Lie continued experimenting with European-style prose. In 1886, he published "<a href="Tjhit%20Liap%20Seng">Tjhit Liap Seng</a>" ("Seven Stars"), which <a href="Claudine%20Salmon">Claudine Salmon</a> of the <a href="School%20for%20Advanced%20Studies%20in%20the%20Social%20Sciences">School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences</a> describes as the first Chinese Malay novel. Lie went on to publish another four novels, as well as several translations. When ethnic Chinese writers became common in the early 1900s, critics named Lie the "father of Chinese Malay literature" for his contributions, including "Siti Akbari" and "Tjhit Liap Seng".

After the rise of the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Awakening">nationalist</a> movement and the Dutch colonial government's efforts to use <a href="Balai%20Pustaka">Balai Pustaka</a> to publish literary works for native consumption, the work began to be marginalised. The Dutch colonial government used <a href="Malay%20language">Court Malay</a> as a "language of administration", a language for everyday dealings, while the Indonesian nationalists appropriated the language to help build a national culture. <a href="Chinese%20Malay%20literature">Chinese Malay literature</a>, written in "low" Malay, was steadily marginalised. Benitez writes that, as a result, there has been little scholarly analysis of "Siti Akbari". Despite this, sinologist <a href="Leo%20Suryadinata">Leo Suryadinata</a> wrote in 1993 that "Siti Akbari" has remained one of the best-known "syairs" written by an ethnic Chinese.

Although both "Sjair Abdoel Moeloek" and "Siti Akbari" were often performed on stage, the similarities between the two were not discovered for several years. Zaini-Lajoubert writes that Tio Ie Soei uncovered these similarities while working as a journalist for the Chinese Malay newspaper "Lay Po" in 1923. Kwee Tek Hoay followed this article with another discussion of the work's origins in 1925. Later writers criticised Lie's other works as blatant adaptations. Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng, for instance, wrote that none of his works were original. Tio Ie Soei, in response, stated that Lie had changed the stories he had adapted, and thus shown originality.

In exploring the similarities between "Sjair Abdoel Moeloek" and "Siti Akbari", Zaini-Lajoubert notes that the names of the individual kingdoms, save Barham (Barbam in "Siti Akbari"), are taken directly from the earlier work. Names of characters, such as Abdul Muluk (in "Siti Akbari", Abdul Moelan) and Siti Rapiah (Siti Akbari), are simply replaced, although some minor characters are present in one story and not the other. The main plot elements in both stories are the same; some elements, such as the birth and childhood of Abdul Muluk and the later adventures of Siti Rapiah's son, are present in one story and not the other – or given more detail. The two differ greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism.

WestJet Encore

WestJet Encore is a Canadian <a href="regional%20airline">regional airline</a> that began operations in 2013. It is owned by WestJet Airlines, Ltd. which also is the holding company for <a href="WestJet%20Airlines">WestJet Airlines</a>. The airline is headquartered in <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>. In response to internal market studies about future growth limitations by WestJet Airlines operating only <a href="Boeing%20737">Boeing 737</a> aircraft, WestJet Encore was formed to allow increased frequency of flights by using smaller aircraft, as well as to expand service to routes with less traffic.

The airline operates <a href="Bombardier%20Q400">Bombardier Q400</a> NextGen aircraft, a variant of the Bombardier Dash 8. The airline is the fourth largest operator of the <a href="Bombardier%20Aerospace">Bombardier</a> Q400 series. Pilot bases are in Calgary and <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, where many WestJet Encore flights operate. Air service originally started in Western Canada, but routes in the eastern half of the country were added later.

The airline is a <a href="low-cost%20carrier">low-cost carrier</a>. It was initially staffed with non-union employees but the pilots have since unionized. Food is available for purchase. WestJet Encore participates in the WestJet Rewards, a revenue-based frequent flyer program that offers flight discount rewards.

Prior to the formation of WestJet Encore, WestJet Airlines, Inc. internal studies concluded in 2005, when the company had 50 <a href="Boeing%20737">Boeing 737</a> aircraft, that WestJet would saturate the Canadian commercial airline market when it reached a 90–100 Boeing 737 aircraft fleet. WestJet Airlines had become the second largest airline in Canada in 2002. Solutions included slowing expansion of the airline or adding smaller aircraft models to serve routes with less traffic. The absence of <a href="turboprop">turboprop</a> aircraft in the WestJet fleet was seen as a disadvantage compared to competitor <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a>. In some cases where Air Canada had smaller aircraft, WestJet either avoided the market or had only one daily flight using a Boeing 737, an aircraft much larger than the ones Air Canada used. Having more flights on a route than a competitor is a competitive advantage.
WestJet made an initial order of 20 Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 NextGen (Q400 NextGen) aircraft through a letter of intent on May 1, 2012, which resulted in a conditional order on June 28, 2012. A firm order of 20 Q400 NextGen and 25 options was announced on August 1, 2012. The <a href="ATR-72">ATR-72-600</a> had been considered, having a lower initial acquisition price and better fuel economy on short flights but slower speed, worse fuel economy on longer flights and slightly less passenger capacity.

The parent company, WestJet Airlines, Ltd., formed WestJet Encore, a low-cost carrier that is a wholly owned but legally separate airline from WestJet. Prior to the selection of the Encore name, other names were considered, including <a href="Chinook%20wind">Chinook</a>, Echo, and Reach. Calgary was selected for the WestJet Encore corporate headquarters but Toronto Pearson International Airport was also considered. WestJet Encore received an Air Operator Certificate separate from WestJet Airlines on June 12, 2013.

On June 24, 2013, with two Q400s in its fleet, it began flights. That day, the airline flew between <a href="Calgary%20International%20Airport">Calgary International Airport</a> and <a href="Saskatoon%20John%20G.%20Diefenbaker%20International%20Airport">Saskatoon</a>, <a href="Nanaimo%20Airport">Nanaimo (British Columbia)</a>, and <a href="Fort%20St.%20John%20Airport">Fort St. John (British Columbia)</a> as well as between Fort. St. John and <a href="Vancouver%20International%20Airport">Vancouver</a>. The IATA assigned WestJet Encore an airline code of "WR", which had previously been used by <a href="Royal%20Tongan%20Airlines">Royal Tongan Airlines</a>.

Some WestJet Encore flights were new routes not served by the WestJet mainline carrier because there was insufficient traffic to support Boeing 737 flights. Other WestJet Encore flights increased frequencies on existing WestJet routes. WestJet Encore's service was initially limited to Western Canada, but it opened service in the eastern part of the country in June 2014 with a route from Toronto to Thunder Bay, Ontario. It later began service on eastern routes centred on Toronto and Halifax. WestJet Encore moved into the international market in 2016, with flights serving <a href="Boston%20Logan%20Airport">Boston Logan Airport</a>; <a href="Nashville%20International%20Airport">Nashville International Airport</a> was added the following year.
WestJet Encore flies Q400 NextGen on regional flights up to 700 nautical miles. 50% of WestJet Encore passengers are traveling on connecting flights with WestJet. The WestJet Encore fleet of Q400s expanded to 18 aircraft by March 2015, and later to 34 aircraft by December 2016 and to 43 aircraft by December 2017. In 2015, WestJet Encore was the fastest-growing operator of Q400 aircraft. By 2017, it was the fourth largest operator of Q400 aircraft in the world.

In August 2015, WestJet Encore adopted a revised livery. The tail and type style used with the word "WestJet" remained the same, but the teal-and-blue geometric widget ahead of the WestJet titles was replaced with a teal-and-blue stylized maple leaf with a similar pattern.

Westjet Encore has a partially unionized workforce. Initially having an entirely non-union staff, the airline became a target for union drives starting in 2014. Starting January 1, 2016, the airline management initiated WestJet Pilots Association, a subgroup of the WestJet Proactive Management Team, to ratify pilot contracts between with WestJet Encore. The pilots union which represents many pilots that fly for U.S. carriers, the <a href="Air%20Line%20Pilots%20Association">Air Line Pilots Association</a>, was successful in unionizing the 500-pilot workforce in November 2017. Pilot bases are located in Calgary and Toronto. WestJet pilots are required to be Canadian citizens or Canadian permanent residents. Pilot shortages in the airline industry have affected WestJet Encore, resulting in requirements that newly hired pilots need only 1,000 flight hours of experience prior to hiring. Pilots are guaranteed an eventual higher paying position flying larger jets at WestJet, unlike competitor airline <a href="Jazz%20%28airline%29">Jazz</a>, which does not offer guarantees of an eventual job at Air Canada. WestJet Encore and its flight attendants reached an agreement regarding compensation and work rules beginning January 1, 2018, for a one-year period. However, the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), who was not a party to the agreement, announced that it would continue efforts to unionize the flight attendant ranks.

On October 31, 2016, a $2 billion, two million square foot international terminal for U.S. cross border and international flights opened at Calgary International Airport, the largest hub of WestJet Encore and its affiliate WestJet. Despite consultation with the airlines, the terminal design proved problematic. The Calgary Airport Authority CEO characterized the new terminal as being "long on aesthetics and short on functionality." There is reduced aircraft efficiency due to the need to tow aircraft to another concourse if an aircraft is used for both domestic and either U.S. cross border or international flights as well as the need to hire additional staff because they cannot be deployed to more than one concourse due to long walking distances. The baggage system of the new terminal is inoperable with the rest of the airport from 2016 to 2019. Passenger problems include WestJet trans-border and international gates being up to a two-kilometre walk to the domestic WestJet gates as well as lack of enough seating at the gate so passengers sit on the floor. These problems are seen as a threat to passenger traffic, which might be driven to other connecting airports, such as Seattle or Vancouver, cities that WestJet Encore has fewer or no flights serving.

WestJet Encore is a wholly owned company of WestJet Airlines, Ltd. Sales and marketing of WestJet Encore flights are conducted by WestJet, An Alberta Partnership, which is jointly owned by two corporate entities owned by WestJet Airlines, Ltd.

The first president of WestJet Encore was Ferio Pugliese, who retained his title of Executive Vice President at WestJet Airlines, Ltd. He was hired in November 2012 coming from WestJet, where he began work in 2007. He left in 2016 to become an Executive Vice President at <a href="Hydro%20One">Hydro One Ltd.</a>, an electricity company. He was replaced in September 2016 by Charles Duncan, an American who previously worked as Senior Vice President of Technical Operations at <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> and, earlier in his career, was Chief Operating Officer at <a href="Continental%20Micronesia">Continental Micronesia</a>.

Financial statistics are not released separately for WestJet Encore but reported for WestJet Airlines, Ltd., which comprises several units and the larger WestJet Airlines. WestJet Encore has increased traffic in markets that it served as well as lowered airfares 30–40% than was previously available.

WestJet Encore flies regional routes throughout Canada, primarily to or from Calgary, Toronto, and Halifax. Routes include smaller cities, such as <a href="Brandon%2C%20Manitoba">Brandon, Manitoba</a> to Calgary, two cities with an oil industry. This new service re-introduced air service to Brandon. Other routes are increased frequencies on existing WestJet routes, such as between Calgary and Saskatoon. WestJet Encore services three destinations outside of <a href="Canada">Canada</a> , namely Boston, Nashville, and, on a seasonal basis, <a href="Myrtle%20Beach%20International%20Airport">Myrtle Beach, South Carolina</a>. WestJet Encore operated flights between <a href="Kelowna%20International%20Airport">Kelowna, British Columbia</a> and <a href="Fort%20McMurray%20International%20Airport">Fort McMurray, Alberta</a>, neither a WestJet Encore hub airport, from 2014 to 2016 but discontinued flights amid a decline in the oil industry due to lower oil prices. WestJet Encore flights are numbered as flight 3100 to 3899.

WestJet Encore operates one type of aircraft, the Bombardier Q400 NextGen, an updated version of the Q400 with updated landing gear, redesigned interiors, lighting, and larger overhead cabin storage. In turn, the Q400 is an updated version of the Bombardier Dash 8-400 that has active noise suppression to create a quieter passenger cabin. To prevent freezing of water lines during overnight stays at airports with cold weather, the airline rendered the water flow to the lavatory basins inoperative in 2013.

WestJet Encore uses a navAero supplied Windows-OS based <a href="electronic%20flight%20bag">electronic flight bag</a> (EFB) that can connect to the aircraft. In conjunction with a WestJet developed Integrated Communication and Application System (ICAS), objective flight data can be shared with maintenance personnel improving aircraft efficiency. One example of use would be after an aircraft was subjected to severe turbulence, EFB and ICAS could determine whether or not objective thresholds were exceeded. If such thresholds are not exceeded, four hours of maintenance and inspection are avoided instead of having pilots subjectively characterize the level of turbulence.

As of May 2018, the WestJet Encore fleet consists of the following aircraft:

WestJet Encore participates in WestJet Rewards, a <a href="frequent%20flyer%20program">frequent flyer program</a> and loyalty scheme originally started by WestJet. Instead of miles or points, WestJet Dollars are earned by participants and can be redeemed as full or partial payment of future airfare. Participants earn 1% of their airfare in WestJet Dollars. Elite level participants, who spend $3000 or more per year in WestJet airfare are classified as Silver or Gold and earn a 3% or 5% rate in WestJet Dollars. WestJet also participates in WestJet Rewards as does Air France (2017–present), KLM (2017–present), Delta Airlines (2014–present), and Qantas (2016–present). WestJet Dollars earned as a base amount do not expire but bonus amounts have an expiry date.

Passengers flying on WestJet Encore may alternatively receive credit in Air France/KLM Flying Blue, Delta Skymiles, or Qantas Frequent Flyer

As well as economy class seating, WestJet Encore aircraft has a designated Plus section. Unlike the Plus section on the mainline carrier, WestJet, it does not have increased legroom. The Plus section on WestJet Encore has seating in the forward part of the cabin and does not have change fees when changing flights ticketed. The majority of WestJet Encore flights do not use <a href="jet%20bridge">jet bridge</a>s and are instead ground loaded, meaning the passengers exit the terminal onto the <a href="Airport%20apron">apron</a> before stepping on to the aircraft. WestJet Encore aircraft do not have drop down oxygen masks, which are not required by regulations due to the aircraft's certification to operate up to 25,000 feet in altitude.

Starting in 2014, newly hired flight attendants are required to be bilingual in English and French. As a result, 94% of flight attendants are bilingual.

Food is available for purchase. 

WestJet Encore does not operate airport lounges but has arrangements with private, non-airline affiliated airport lounges where WestJet Encore passengers are extended a discount for pay-for-visit use.

Lie Kim Hok

Lie Kim Hok (; 1 November 1853 – 6 May 1912) was a <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">"peranakan" Chinese</a> teacher, writer, and <a href="social%20work">social work</a>er active in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> and styled the "father of <a href="Chinese%20Malay%20literature">Chinese Malay literature</a>". Born in Buitenzorg (now <a href="Bogor">Bogor</a>), <a href="West%20Java">West Java</a>, Lie received his formal education in missionary schools and by the 1870s was fluent in <a href="Sundanese%20language">Sundanese</a>, <a href="Malay%20trade%20and%20creole%20languages">vernacular Malay</a>, and <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, though he was unable to understand <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>. In the mid-1870s he married and began working as the editor of two periodicals published by his teacher and mentor D. J. van der Linden. Lie left the position in 1880. His wife died the following year. Lie published his first books, including the critically acclaimed "<a href="syair">syair</a>" (poem) "<a href="Sair%20Tjerita%20Siti%20Akbari">Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari</a>" and grammar book "<a href="Malajoe%20Batawi">Malajoe Batawi</a>", in 1884. When van der Linden died the following year, Lie purchased the printing press and opened his own company.

Over the following two years Lie published numerous books, including "<a href="Tjhit%20Liap%20Seng">Tjhit Liap Seng</a>", considered the first Chinese Malay novel. He also acquired printing rights for "<a href="Pembrita%20Betawi">Pembrita Betawi</a>", a newspaper based in Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>), and moved to the city. After selling his printing press in 1887, the writer spent three years working in various lines of employment until he found stability in 1890 at a rice mill operated by a friend. The following year he married Tan Sioe Nio, with whom he had four children. Lie published two books in the 1890s and, in 1900, became a founding member of the Chinese organisation <a href="Tiong%20Hoa%20Hwee%20Koan">Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan</a>, which he left in 1904. Lie focused on his translations and social work for the remainder of his life, until his death from <a href="typhus">typhus</a> at age 58.

Lie is considered influential to the colony's journalism, linguistics, and literature. According to the Malaysian scholar Ahmad Adam, he is best remembered for his literary works. Several of his writings were printed multiple times, and "Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari" was adapted for the stage and <a href="Siti%20Akbari">screen</a>. However, as a result of the <a href="language%20politics">language politics</a> in the Indies and independent Indonesia, his work has become marginalised. When several of his writings were revealed as uncredited adaptations of existing works, Lie was criticised as unoriginal. Other critics, however, have found evidence of innovation in his writing style and handling of plots.

Lie was born in Buitenzorg (now <a href="Bogor">Bogor</a>), <a href="West%20Java">West Java</a>, on 1 November 1853, the first child of seven born to Lie Hian Tjouw and his second wife Oey Tjiok Nio. The elder Lie had four children from a previous marriage, with Lie Kim Hok his first child from the new marriage. The well-to-do <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">"peranakan" Chinese</a> couple was living in <a href="Cianjur">Cianjur</a> at the time but went to Buitenzorg, Lie Hian Tjouw's hometown, for the birth as they had family there. The family soon returned to Cianjur, where Lie Kim Hok was <a href="homeschooling">homeschooled</a> in <a href="Chinese%20tradition">Chinese tradition</a> and the local <a href="Sundanese%20people">Sundanese</a> culture and <a href="Sundanese%20language">language</a>. By age seven he could haltingly read Sundanese and <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>.

In the mid-19th century the colony's ethnic Chinese population was severely undereducated, unable to enter schools for either Europeans or <a href="Native%20Indonesians">natives</a>. Aged ten, Lie was enrolled in a <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> missionary school run by Christiaan Albers. This school had roughly 60 male students, mostly Chinese. Under Albers, a fluent speaker of Sundanese, he received his formal education in a curriculum which included the sciences, language, and Christianity – the schools were meant to promote Christianity in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, and students were required to pray before class. Lie, as with most students, did not convert, although biographer <a href="Tio%20Ie%20Soei">Tio Ie Soei</a> writes that an understanding of Christianity likely affected his <a href="world%20view">world view</a>.
Lie and his family returned to Buitenzorg in 1866. At the time there were no schools offering a European-style education in the city, and thus he was sent to a Chinese-run school. For three years, in which the youth studied under three different headmasters, he was made to repeat traditional <a href="Hokkien%20dialect">Hokkien</a> phrases and copy <a href="Chinese%20character">Chinese character</a>s without understanding them. Tio suggests that Lie obtained little knowledge at the school, and until his death Lie was unable to understand <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>. During his time in Buitenzorg, he studied painting under <a href="Raden%20Saleh">Raden Saleh</a>, a friend of his father's. Although he reportedly showed skill, he did not continue the hobby as his mother disapproved. He also showed a propensity for traditional literary forms such as "<a href="pantun">pantun</a>" (a form of poetry) and was fond of creating his own.

When <a href="Sierk%20Coolsma">Sierk Coolsma</a> opened a missionary school in Buitenzorg on 31 May 1869, Lie was in the first class of ten. Once again studying in Sundanese, he took similar subjects to his time in Cianjur. Around this time he began studying <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>. After a government-run school opened in 1872, most of Lie's classmates were ethnic Chinese; the Sundanese students, mostly Muslim, had transferred to the new school for fear of being converted to Christianity. In 1873 Coolsma was sent to <a href="Sumedang">Sumedang</a> to translate the Bible into Sundanese and was replaced by fellow missionary D. J. van der Linden. Studies resumed in Malay, as van der Linden was unable to speak Sundanese. Lie and his new headmaster soon became close. The two later worked together at van der Linden's school and publishing house and shared an interest in traditional theatre, including "<a href="wayang">wayang</a>" (puppets).

By the age of twenty Lie had a good command of Sundanese and Malay; he also spoke fair Dutch, a rarity for ethnic Chinese at the time. Lie assisted van der Linden at the missionary school, and in the mid-1870s operated a general school for poor Chinese children. He also worked for the missionary's printing press, Zending Press, earning forty <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20gulden">gulden</a> a month while serving as editor of two religious magazines, the Dutch-language monthly "De Opwekker" and the Malay-language bi-weekly "Bintang Djohor". He married Oey Pek Nio, seven years his junior, in 1876. Tio, in an interview with the scholar of <a href="Chinese%20Malay%20literature">Chinese Malay literature</a> <a href="Claudine%20Salmon">Claudine Salmon</a>, stated that Lie had been betrothed to Oey's elder sister, but when she ran away the night before the ceremony, he was told to by his parents to marry Oey Pek Nio to save face. Although displeased with the arrangement, he obeyed. The pair soon grew close. The following year they had their first child, although the baby died soon after birth. Lie's mother died in 1879, and his father died the next year.
Following these deaths Lie was unable to support his wife. He therefore sold his school to Oey Kim Hoat and left his position at Zending Press to take a job as a land surveyor. In the next four years he held various jobs. In 1881 Oey Pek Nio gave birth again. She <a href="Maternal%20death">died soon afterwards</a> and the baby was sent to live with her grandfather father in Gadog, a village to the southeast of Buitenzorg, to be raised. The child died in 1886. Lie published his first books in 1884. Two of these, "Kitab Edja" and "Sobat Anak-Anak", were published by Zending Press. The former was a study book to help students learn to write Malay, while the latter was a collection of <a href="Children%27s%20literature">stories for children</a> that Aprinus Salam of <a href="Gadjah%20Mada%20University">Gadjah Mada University</a> credits as the first work of <a href="popular%20culture">popular literature</a> in the Indies. The other two books were published by W. Bruining & Co., based in the colonial capital at Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>). One of these, "<a href="Malajoe%20Batawi">Malajoe Batawi</a>", was a grammar of Malay intended to standardise the language's spelling. The other was the four-volume "<a href="syair">syair</a>" (a traditional Malay form of poetry) "<a href="Sair%20Tjerita%20Siti%20Akbari">Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari</a>"; this book, dealing with a <a href="cross-dressing">gender-disguised</a> warrior who conquers the Sultanate of Hindustan to save her husband, became one of Lie's best-known works.

After van der Linden's death in 1885, Lie paid his teacher's widow a total of 1,000 gulden to acquire the Zending Press; the funds were, in part, borrowed from his friends. He changed the printer's name to Lie Kim Hok soon afterwards. He devoted most of his time to the publishing house, and it grew quickly, printing works by other authors and reprinting some of Lie's earlier writings. The publishing house was, however, unable to turn a profit. That year he published a new "syair", consisting of 24 <a href="quartet">quartet</a>s, entitled "Orang Prampoewan". He also wrote opinion pieces in various newspapers, including "Bintang Betawi" and "Domingoe".

The following year Lie purchased publishing rights to the Malay-language newspaper "<a href="Pembrita%20Betawi">Pembrita Betawi</a>", based in Batavia and edited by W. Meulenhoff, for 1,000 gulden. He again borrowed from his friends. From mid-1886, Lie's publishing house (which he had moved to Batavia) was credited as the newspaper's printer. While busy with the press, he wrote or contributed to four books. Two were pieces of nonfiction, one a collection of Chinese prophecies and the last outlined lease laws. The third was a partial translation of the "<a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">One Thousand and One Nights</a>", a collection already popular with Malay audiences. The last was his first novel, "<a href="Tjhit%20Liap%20Seng">Tjhit Liap Seng</a>". Following a group of educated persons in mainland China, "Tjhit Liap Seng" is credited as the first Chinese Malay novel.

Lie continued to publish novels set in China through 1887, writing five in this period. Several of these stories were based on extant Chinese tales, as retold by his Chinese-speaking friends. The writer sold his shares in "Pembrita Betawi" to Karsseboom & Co. in 1887, but continued to print the newspaper until it – and Lie's printing press – were acquired by Albrecht & Co. later that year. Lie did not work as a publisher again, although he continued to contribute writings to various newspapers, including Meulenhoff's new publication "Hindia Olanda". Over the next three years he did not have fixed employment, taking a multitude of jobs, including bamboo salesman, contractor, and cashier.

In 1890 Lie began working at a rice mill operated by his friend Tan Wie Siong as a supervisor; this would be his main source of income for the remainder of his life. The following year he married Tan Sioe Nio, twenty years his junior. The new couple had a comfortable life: his salary was adequate, and the work did not consume much energy. To supplement his income Lie returned to translating, Dutch to Malay or vice versa. Sometimes he would translate land deeds or other legal documents. Other times he translated works of literature. This included "De Graaf de Monte Cristo", an 1894 translation of <a href="Alexandre%20Dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a>' "<a href="The%20Count%20of%20Monte%20Cristo">Le Comte de Monte-Cristo</a>", which he completed in collaboration with the <a href="Indo%20people">Indo</a> journalist F. Wiggers. The two included footnotes to describe aspects of European culture which they deemed difficult for non-European readers to understand. Three years later Lie published "Hikajat Kong Hoe Tjoe", a book on the teachings of <a href="Confucius">Confucius</a>. Its contents were derived from European writings on <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and his friends' explanations.
With nineteen other ethnic Chinese, including his former schoolmate <a href="Phoa%20Keng%20Hek">Phoa Keng Hek</a>, Lie was an establishing member of the <a href="Tiong%20Hoa%20Hwee%20Koan">Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan</a> (THHK) school system and social organisation in 1900. Meant to promote ethnic Chinese rights at a time when they were <a href="Discrimination%20against%20Chinese%20Indonesians">treated as second-class citizens</a> and provide standardised formal education to ethnic Chinese students where the Dutch had not, the organisation was based on the teachings of Confucius and opened schools for both boys and girls. The THHK grew quickly and expanded into different fields, and Lie helped organise a debating club, sports club, and charity fairs and concerts. From 1903 to 1904 Lie was a managing member of the board, serving mainly as its treasurer.

Lie left the THHK in 1904, although he remained active in social work. Despite increasingly poor health, he wrote opinion pieces for the dailies "Sin Po" and "Perniagaan". He also translated extensively. In 1905 Lie published the first volume of his last Chinese-themed novel, "Pembalasan Dendam Hati". This was followed three years later by "Kapitein Flamberge", a translation of <a href="Paul%20Sauni%C3%A8re">Paul Saunière</a>'s "Le Capitaine Belle-Humeur". In the following years he translated several books featuring <a href="Pierre%20Alexis%20Ponson%20du%20Terrail">Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail</a>'s fictional adventurer <a href="Rocambole%20%28character%29">Rocambole</a>, beginning with "Kawanan Pendjahat" in 1910. Two final translations were published in newspapers and collated as novels after Lie's death: "Geneviève de Vadans", from a book entitled "De Juffrouw van Gezelschap", and "Prampoean jang Terdjoewal", from Hugo Hartmann's "Dolores, de Verkochte Vrouw". The former translation was completed by the journalist <a href="Lauw%20Giok%20Lan">Lauw Giok Lan</a>.

On the night of 2 May 1912 Lie became ill, and two days later his doctor diagnosed him with <a href="typhus">typhus</a>. His condition steadily declined and on 6 May 1912 he died. He was buried in <a href="Petamburan%2C%20Tanah%20Abang">Kota Bambu, Batavia</a>. THHK schools throughout the city flew their flags at <a href="half-mast">half-mast</a>. Lie was survived by his wife and four children: Soan Nio (born 1892), Hong Nio (born 1896), Kok Hian (born 1898), and Kok Hoei (born 1901). Tan Sioe Nio died the following year.

In his journalism career Lie attempted to avoid the <a href="yellow%20press">yellow press</a> tactics used by his contemporaries and preferred to avoid extensive <a href="polemic">polemic</a>s in the press. Malaysian journalism historian Ahmat Adam, writing in 1995, notes that Lie's entry into the press sparked a wave of "peranakan" Chinese writers to become newspaper editors, and Sumardjo suggests that Lie remained best known to native Indonesians through his work in the press.

From a <a href="Linguistics">linguist's</a> perspective, Kasijanto Sastrodinomo of the <a href="University%20of%20Indonesia">University of Indonesia</a> describes "Malajoe Batawi" as "extraordinary", noting that the first Malay-language textbook was written by a non-Malay. He also emphasises that the book did not use any English-derived linguistics terms which were omnipresent in 20th-century Indonesian textbooks. Linguist Waruno Mahdi writes that Lie's "Malajoe Batawi" was the "most remarkable achievement of Chinese Malay writing" from a linguist's point of view. In his doctoral dissertation, Benitez suggests that Lie may have hoped for bazaar Malay to become a "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" in the Dutch East Indies. In his history of Chinese Malay literature, <a href="Nio%20Joe%20Lan">Nio Joe Lan</a> finds that Lie, influenced by his missionary education, tried to maintain an orderly use of language in a period where such attention to grammar was uncommon. Nio describes Lie as the "only contemporary "peranakan" Chinese writer who had studied Malay grammar methodically." Adam considers Lie's works to have left "an indelible mark on the development of modern Indonesian language".
Adam suggests that Lie is best remembered for his contributions to <a href="Indonesian%20literature">Indonesian literature</a>, with his publications well received by his contemporaries. Tio writes that "old and young intimately read his (Lie's) writings, which were praised for their simple language, rhythm, clarity, freshness, and strength. The skill and accuracy with which he chose his words, the neatness and orderliness with which he arranged his sentences. ... People said that he was ahead of his time. He was likened to a large shining star, a stark contrast to the small, faded stars in the dark sky." Further praise was awarded by other contemporaries, both native and Chinese, such as Ibrahim gelar Marah Soetan and <a href="Agus%20Salim">Agus Salim</a>. When ethnic Chinese writers became common in the early 1900s, critics named Lie the "father of Chinese Malay literature" for his contributions, including "Siti Akbari" and "Tjhit Liap Seng".

Several of Lie's books, including "Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari", "Kitab Edja", "Orang Prampoewan", and "Sobat Anak-anak", had multiple printings, though Tio does not record any after the 1920s. In 2000 "Kitab Edja" was reprinted in the inaugural volume of "Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia", an anthology of Chinese Malay literature. His "Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari", which he considered one of his best works, was adapted for the stage several times. Lie used a simplified version for a troupe of teenaged actors, which was successful in West Java. In 1922 the <a href="Sukabumi">Sukabumi</a> branch of the Shiong Tih Hui published another stage adaptation under the title "Pembalesan Siti Akbari", which was being performed by the theatre troupe <a href="Miss%20Riboet%27s%20Orion">Miss Riboet's Orion</a> by 1926. The <a href="Wong%20brothers">Wong brothers</a> directed a film entitled "<a href="Siti%20Akbari">Siti Akbari</a>", starring <a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a> and <a href="Rd.%20Mochtar">Rd. Mochtar</a>. The 1940 film was purportedly based on Lie's poem, although the extent of the influence is uncertain.

After the rise of the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Awakening">nationalist</a> movement and the Dutch colonial government's efforts to use <a href="Balai%20Pustaka">Balai Pustaka</a> to publish literary works for native consumption, Lie's work began to be marginalised. The Dutch colonial government used <a href="Malay%20language">Court Malay</a> as a language of administration, a language for everyday dealings that was taught in schools. Court Malay was generally spoken by the nobility in Sumatra, whereas bazaar Malay had developed as a <a href="creole%20language">creole</a> for use in trade through much of the Western archipelago; it was thus more common among the lower class. The Indonesian nationalists appropriated Court Malay to help build a national culture, promoted through the press and literature. Chinese Malay literature, written in "low" Malay, was steadily marginalised and declared to be of poor quality. Tio, writing in 1958, found that the younger generation were not learning about Lie and his works, and four years later Nio wrote that bazaar Malay had "made its way to the museums". Literary historian Monique Zaini-Lajoubert indicates that no critical studies of "Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari" were undertaken between 1939 and 1994.

Writing for the Chinese-owned newspaper "Lay Po" in 1923, Tio revealed that "Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari" had been heavily influenced by the 1847 poem "<a href="Syair%20Abdul%20Muluk">Sjair Abdoel Moeloek</a>", credited variously to <a href="Raja%20Ali%20Haji">Raja Ali Haji</a> or his sister Saleha. He noted that "Sair Siti Akbari", which Lie stated to be his own, closely followed the earlier work's plot. In his 1958 biography, Tio revealed that Lie's "Tjhit Liap Seng" was an amalgamation of two European novels: <a href="Jacob%20van%20Lennep">Jacob van Lennep</a>'s "Klaasje Zevenster" (1865) and <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>'s "<a href="Tribulations%20of%20a%20Chinaman%20in%20China">Les Tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine</a>" (1879). Tio noted that a third book, "Pembalasan Dendam Hati", had extensive parallels with a work by <a href="Xavier%20de%20Mont%C3%A9pin">Xavier de Montépin</a> translated as "De Wraak van de Koddebeier". In face of these revelations, literary critics such as Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng wrote that none of Lie's writings were original.

This conclusion has been extensively challenged by writers who have shown original elements in Lie's work. Tio noted that in translating "Kapitein Flamberge", Lie had changed the ending: the main character no longer died in an explosion of <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a>, but survived to marry his love interest, Hermine de Morlay. In exploring the similarities between "Sjair Abdoel Moeloek" and "Siti Akbari", Zaini-Lajoubert noted that the main plot elements in both stories are the same, although some are present in one story and not the other – or given more detail. She found that the two differed greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism. Salmon wrote that "Tjhit Liap Seng" general plot mostly followed that of "Klaasje Zevenster", with some sections that seemed to be direct translations. However, she found that Lie also added, subtracted, and modified contents; she noted his more sparse approach to description and the introduction of a new character, Thio Tian, who had lived in <a href="Java">Java</a>. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo summarised that Lie "may be said to have been original in his style, but not in his material".

According to Tio, Lie published 25 books and pamphlets; entries here are derived from his list. Salmon writes that some, such as "Lok Bouw Tan", may <a href="lost%20work">no longer be extant</a>. Lie also wrote some short stories, which are not listed here.
