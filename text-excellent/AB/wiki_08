Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre

Almirante Latorre, named after <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Latorre">Juan José Latorre</a>, was a <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a> built for the <a href="Chilean%20Navy">Chilean Navy</a> ("Armada de Chile"). It was the first of a <a href="Almirante%20Latorre-class%20battleship">planned two-ship class</a> that would respond to <a href="South%20American%20dreadnought%20race">earlier warship purchases by other South American countries</a>. Construction began at <a href="Elswick%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Elswick</a>, <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> soon after the ship was ordered in November 1911, and was approaching completion when it was bought by the United Kingdom's <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> for use in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. <a href="ship%20commissioning">Commissioned</a> in September 1915, it served in the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> as HMS "Canada" for the duration of the war and saw action during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>.

Chile repurchased "Canada" in 1920 and re-named it "Almirante Latorre". The ship was designated as Chile's <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, and frequently served as a presidential transport. It underwent a thorough modernization in the United Kingdom in 1929–1931. In September 1931, crewmen aboard "Almirante Latorre" instigated <a href="Chilean%20naval%20mutiny%20of%201931">a mutiny</a>, which the majority of the Chilean fleet quickly joined. After divisions developed between the mutineers, the rebellion fell apart and the ships returned to government control. "Almirante Latorre" was placed in reserve for a time in the 1930s because of the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20Latin%20America">Great Depression</a>, but it was in good enough condition to receive interest from the United States after the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. The Chilean government declined the overture and the ship spent most of the Second World War on patrol for Chile. "Almirante Latorre" was <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> in Japan beginning in 1959.

"Almirante Latorre"s genesis can be traced to the numerous naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, which in turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> and <a href="Puna%20de%20Atacama">Puna de Atacama</a>, along with control of the <a href="Beagle%20Channel">Beagle Channel</a>. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> bought the two <a href="Swiftsure-class%20battleship">"Constitución"-class</a> <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two <a href="Kasuga-class%20cruiser">"Rivadavia"-class</a> <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s under construction in Italy to Japan.

After was commissioned, Brazil decided in early 1907 to halt construction of three obsolescent <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnoughts</a> in favor of two or three <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s. These ships, commissioned as the , were designed to carry the heaviest battleship armament in the world at the time. They came as a shock to the navies of South America. Historian Robert Scheina commented that they "outclassed the entire [elderly] Argentinian fleet". Although debates raged in Argentina over whether it would be prudent to counter Brazil's purchase by acquiring their own expensive dreadnoughts, further border disputes—particularly near the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">River Plate</a> with Brazil—decided the matter, and it ordered two s (no relation to the earlier cruisers) from the <a href="Fore%20River%20Shipyard">Fore River Shipbuilding Company</a> in the United States. With its major rival acquiring dreadnoughts, Chile responded by <a href="Call%20for%20bids">asking for tenders</a> from American and European countries that would give the country the most powerful battleships afloat.

On 6 July 1910, the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Chile">National Congress of Chile</a> passed a <a href="Bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bill</a> allocating 400,000 <a href="pounds%20sterling">pounds sterling</a> to the navy for two <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s—which would eventually be named "Almirante Latorre" and <a href="HMS%20Eagle%20%281918%29">"Almirante Cochrane"</a>—six <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, and two <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. The contract to build the battleships was awarded to <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> on 25 July 1911. "Almirante Latorre" was officially ordered on 2 November 1911, and was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> less than a month later on 27 November, becoming the largest ship built by Armstrong at the time. The "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>" reported on 2 November 1913 that <a href="Greece">Greece</a> had reached an accord to purchase "Almirante Latorre" during a war scare with the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.

"Almirante Latorre" was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 27 November 1913, in an elaborate ceremony that was attended by various dignitaries and presided over by Chile's ambassador to the United Kingdom, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Edwards%20Mac%20Clure">Agustín Edwards Mac Clure</a>. The battleship was <a href="ship%20christening">christened</a> by the ambassador's wife, Olga Budge de Edwards.

After the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> broke out in Europe, "Almirante Latorre" was formally purchased by the United Kingdom on 9 September 1914; it was not forcibly seized like the Ottoman <a href="Ottoman%20battleship%20Re%C5%9Fadiye">"Reşadiye"</a> and <a href="Ottoman%20battleship%20Sult%C3%A2n%20Osm%C3%A2n-%C4%B1%20Evvel">"Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel"</a>, two other ships being built for a foreign navy, because the Allies' reliance on Chilean <a href="Sodium%20nitrate">munitions imports</a> made retention of Chile's "friendly neutral" status with the United Kingdom a matter of vital importance. "Almirante Latorre" was renamed <a href="HMS%20Canada">HMS "Canada"</a> and slightly modified for British service. The <a href="Bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> was taken off in favor of two open platforms, and a <a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">mast</a> was added in between the two funnels to support a derrick that would service <a href="Launch%20%28boat%29">launches</a>. The super-dreadnought completed <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> on 20 September 1915, and was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> on 15 October.

She initially served with the <a href="4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. "Canada" saw action in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May–1 June 1916, firing 42 rounds from its 14-inch guns and 109 6-inch shells during the battle, and suffered no hits or casualties. During the battle, it got off two salvoes at the disabled cruiser at 18:40, and fired five more at an unknown ship around 19:20. Its 6-inch guns were utilized for firing at German destroyers at 19:11. "Canada" was transferred to the <a href="1st%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battle Squadron</a> on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, it was fitted with better rangefinders and <a href="range%20dial">range dial</a>s, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> turrets fore and aft. "Canada" was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.

After the end of the war in Europe, Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet. The United Kingdom offered many of its surplus warships, including the two remaining s. The news that Chile could possibly acquire two "Invincible"s kindled a major uproar in the country, with naval officers publicly denouncing such an action and instead promoting the virtues of submarines and aircraft on the basis of lower costs and their performance in the First World War. The nations of South America worried that an attempt to regain the title of "the first naval power in South America" would start another naval arms race.

In the end, Chile purchased only "Canada" and four destroyers in April 1920, all of which had been ordered by Chile prior to the war's outbreak and requisitioned by the British for the war. The total cost of the five ships was less than a third of what Chile was due to pay for "Almirante Latorre" in 1914. "Canada" was renamed "Almirante Latorre" once again and formally handed over to the Chilean government on 27 November 1920. It departed <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> the same day with two of the destroyers, and , under the command of Admiral <a href="Luis%20Gomez%20Carre%C3%B1o">Luis Gomez Carreño</a>. They arrived in Chile on 20 February 1921, where they were welcomed by Chile's president, <a href="Arturo%20Alessandri">Arturo Alessandri</a>. "Almirante Latorre" was made the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the navy.

In its capacity as flagship of the Chilean Navy, "Almirante Latorre" was frequently utilized by the president for various functions. In the aftermath of the <a href="Moment%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude</a> 8.5 <a href="1922%20Vallenar%20earthquake">1922 Vallenar earthquake</a>, "Almirante Latorre" was used to transport Alessandri to the affected area. The ship also brought "tents, medical supplies, rations, clothing and 2,000,000 <a href="Chilean%20peso">pesos</a>" for those affected. By 1923, Chile only had "Almirante Latorre", a cruiser, and five destroyers in commission, leading "The New York Times" to remark "experts would probably place Chile third in potential sea power [after Brazil and Argentina]". While "Almirante Latorre" was individually more powerful than the Brazilian or Argentine dreadnoughts, they had two each to Chile's one. Compounding this was a lack of modern cruisers to accompany the lone dreadnought. In 1924, "Almirante Latorre" hosted the president again when he visited <a href="Talcahuano">Talcahuano</a> for the grand opening of a new naval drydock there. After the fall of the <a href="Government%20Junta%20of%20Chile%20%281925%29">January Junta</a> in 1925, the dreadnought hosted the returning President Alessandri during a <a href="Naval%20Review">Naval Review</a> in Valparaíso; while on board, he gave a speech to senior naval officials to assure them that his new government "was for all Chileans, and not partisan in its inspiration". In September, the last month of his term, Alessandri received the United Kingdom's <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, on board the battleship. The visit briefly quelled domestic unrest, and it marked the beginning of negotiations for a British <a href="naval%20mission">naval mission</a>, which arrived in the following year.

"Almirante Latorre" was sent to the United Kingdom for a modernization at the <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport Dockyard</a> in 1929. Departing Chile on 15 May, it traveled past <a href="Balboa%2C%20Panama">Balboa</a> before traversing the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> nine days later. After refueling at <a href="Port%20of%20Spain">Port of Spain</a> on 28 May, the dreadnought continued across the Atlantic, passing the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> before arriving in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 24 June. Major alterations included rebuilding the bridge, updating the main battery fire control to more modern standards and adding it for the secondary armament for the first time, and replacing its steam turbine engines. Also added were a new mast between the third and fourth turrets, <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a>s similar to the British s, and new <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns. Nearly two years after the modernization began, "Almirante Latorre" sailed back to Valparaíso on 5 March 1931 and put in on 12 April. Two <a href="tug%20boat">tug boat</a>s which had been acquired for use in the harbors of <a href="Punta%20Arenas">Punta Arenas</a> and Valparaíso were carried on the battleship's deck during its voyage back to Chile.

Despite the goodwill brought on by the removal of the "strongman" President <a href="Carlos%20Ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez%20del%20Campo">Carlos Ibáñez del Campo</a> in July 1931, Chile could not overcome the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>'s severe economic effects, and wages for <a href="civil%20servant">civil servant</a>s making over 3,000 <a href="Chilean%20peso">pesos</a> a year were cut by 12–30 percent to reduce government expenditures. This triggered a severe reaction among the sailors of the navy, who had already suffered a 10 percent salary cut and 50 percent loss in overseas bonuses. Various members of the crew on board "Almirante Latorre", but no officers, met on 31 August and decided that a mutiny was the best course of action.

Shortly after midnight on 1 September, the junior crew members of "Almirante Latorre", an armored cruiser (), seven destroyers, and a few submarines took over their ships while many of their shipmates were watching a boxing tournament in <a href="La%20Serena%2C%20Chile">La Serena</a>. They imprisoned the officers, most without conflict, and secured the ships by about 02:00. They elected a committee, the "Estado Mayor de Tripulacion", to take control of the mutiny. Later that day, at 16:55, the mutineers radioed the minister of the navy, declaring that they were acting on their own accord, as opposed to acting in concert with a militant political party or communist insurgents. They asked for their full salaries to be restored and the punishment of those who had plunged Chile into a depression, while also stating that they would not use force to achieve these goals.

Just before midnight on 2 September, the mutineers messaged the Chilean government with a more "sophisticated" list of twelve demands. Meanwhile, further south, junior members of the navy in the main naval base of <a href="Talcahuano">Talcahuano</a> joined the mutiny, taking several vessels in the process. Several of these sailed north to join the other rebels, while two cruisers, a few destroyers and submarines remained to guard the base. Other bases joined the now-full-fledged rebellion as well, including the Second Air Group based in <a href="Quintero">Quintero</a>. With so many rebels appearing, it was feared by many that the plethora of unemployed workers would join. The government attempted to solicit aid from the United States in the form of military intervention or war materiel (including two submarines and bombs capable of penetrating the armor of "Almirante Latorre"), but they were rebuffed both publicly and privately. Acting Vice President <a href="Manuel%20Trucco">Manuel Trucco</a> now found himself in an undesirable position; he had to defeat the rebels before more units joined and bolstered their forces, but if he was too harsh, there was a risk that the populace would think that his policies were too similar to the former dictator Ibáñez del Campo. Trucco decided on a path of reconciliation. He sent a naval admiral, <a href="Edgardo%20von%20Schroeders">Edgardo von Schroeders</a>, to negotiate with the mutineers. They met on board "Almirante Latorre", where von Schroeders, seeing a potential split between sailors angry over their pay versus others with a more political agenda, tried to divide them along these lines and get them to surrender. However, a plea from the approaching southern fleet, asking for them to wait before any possible settlement, sealed the matter for the time being and von Schroders flew back to the capital.

September marked a turn in the rebels' fortunes, despite the arrival of the southern fleet on September 4. All of their land gains were taken by government forces, leaving only the fleet in the mutineers' hands. By the next day, an air strike was mounted by government forces. The only damage done was to the submarine "H4", which was unable to dive, but at least one bomb landed about from "Almirante Latorre". Despite the scant damage, the attack broke the mutineers' spirits; they quickly offered to send a delegation to Santiago to discuss terms, but the government, bolstered by its land victories, refused. While the mutiny devolved into arguing and anarchy, individual ships began leaving the bay and setting sail for Valparaíso, and the rest soon followed. "Almirante Latorre" ended up in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Tongoy">Bay of Tongoy</a> with . Seven crewmen on the dreadnought received death sentences, later commuted to life in prison.

Still in the midst of the depression, "Almirante Latorre" was deactivated at Talcahuano in 1933 to lessen government expenditures, and only a caretaker crew was assigned to tend to the <a href="%3Awikt%3Amothballed">mothballed</a> ship into the mid-1930s. In a 1937 refit in the Talcahuano dockyard, the aircraft catapult was taken off and anti-aircraft weaponry was added. "Almirante Latorre" was never fully modernized, however, and by the Second World War its <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> was comparatively short-ranged and its armor protection, designed before the "<a href="all%20or%20nothing%20%28armor%29">all or nothing</a>" principle was put into practice, was wholly inadequate. Nevertheless, soon after Japan's <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, the United States Government approached the Chilean <a href="Military%20attach%C3%A9">naval attaché</a> and the vice admiral heading Chile's naval commission to the United States with the aim of purchasing "Almirante Latorre" and a few destroyers to bolster the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. The offer was declined, and "Almirante Latorre" was used for <a href="neutrality%20patrol">neutrality patrol</a>s during the Second World War.

After a 1951 accident in "Almirante Latorre"s engine room killed three crewmen, the ship was kept moored in Talcahuano as a storage hulk for fuel oil. It was <a href="ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> in October 1958, and was sold to <a href="Mitsubishi%20Heavy%20Industries">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</a> in February 1959 for $881,110 to be <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap. On 29 May 1959, to the salutes of the assembled Chilean fleet, the old dreadnought was taken under tow by the tug "Cambrian Salvos", and reached <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, Japan, at the end of August, though the scrapping process did not begin immediately on arrival.

Typhoon Sudal

Typhoon Sudal (), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Cosme, was the strongest <a href="tropical%20cyclone">typhoon</a> to strike the island of <a href="Yap">Yap</a> in the <a href="Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a> (FSM) in about 50 years. Yap is one of the four <a href="Administrative%20divisions%20of%20the%20Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia">administrative divisions</a> of the FSM. The entire island, only in length, experienced typhoon force winds, and 90% of the structures were damaged or destroyed. Damage was most severe in southeastern Yap, where the <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eyewall</a> struck and winds exceeded 185 km/h (115 mph), but the center of the typhoon passed south of the island.

Typhoon Sudal originally formed on April 2, 2004, out of a persistent area of <a href="atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> east of the FSM. It moved mostly westward for the first week of its duration, with brief northerly and southwesterly turns. Sudal attained tropical storm status on April 5, and it gradually intensified into a typhoon, which is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119 km/h (74 mph) and is the equivalent of a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. On April 9, it passed just south of Yap, and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240 km/h (150 mph). Later, Sudal moved to the northwest and eventually to the northeast, becoming an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> on April 16 and dissipating two days later.

In addition to the damage on Yap, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall in <a href="Chuuk%20State">Chuuk</a> in the Federated States of Micronesia, where some minor crop damage occurred. Sudal also brushed the United States islands of <a href="Guam">Guam</a> and <a href="Rota%20%28island%29">Rota</a> with high waves and light rainfall, and later moved very close to the uninhabited Japanese island of <a href="Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a>. Overall damage was $14 million (2004 <a href="USD">USD</a>, $16.1 million 2010 USD), most of which was on Yap, although no fatalities or serious injuries were reported. Due to the heavy damage, the name was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Pacific%20typhoon%20names">retired</a> and replaced with "Mirinae". The name "Sudal" was contributed by South Korea for the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">Pacific tropical cyclone list</a> and is the Korean name for the <a href="otter">otter</a>.

The origins of Typhoon Sudal were from a persistent area of <a href="atmospheric%20convection">convection</a>, or thunderstorms, southeast of <a href="Pohnpei">Pohnpei</a> in the <a href="Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a> toward the end of March 2004. Initially, it was in an area of high <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, which is the change in wind direction with height and is unfavorable for <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a>. The unfavorable conditions gradually abated, which allowed convection to increase over a broad, developing <a href="atmospheric%20circulation">circulation center</a>. On April 2, the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) classified the system as a weak <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical depression</a> near <a href="Chuuk%20State">Chuuk</a> in the FSM. It was later classified with the international designation of 0401, meaning it was the first tropical cyclone of 2004. Slow development continued as the system moved slowly westward, and two days later it was classified as Tropical Depression 03W by the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC); this was the third tropical cyclone tracked by the agency. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, after convection increased over the circulation.

While steadily intensifying, the system turned toward the north. On April 5, the JMA named the system Sudal, after assessing its <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s at 65 km/h (40 mph ). Concurrently, the JTWC estimated winds of 100 km/h (65 km/h ). After crossing over the island of <a href="Poluwat">Poluwat</a>, a building <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to the north caused Sudal to turn west-southwestward. On April 6, an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye feature</a> began forming, and the JTWC upgraded Sudal to typhoon strength about southeast of <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, a small island under possession of the United States. The JMA did not follow suit until late the following day, by which time the eye had become more distinct. Around that time, the typhoon turned toward the northwest, and initially it was thought that Sudal would pass safely north of <a href="Yap">Yap</a> in the FSM. Instead, it turned to the west-southwest toward the island as the ridge intensified. On April 8, the typhoon intensified rapidly; the JTWC reported winds of 215 km/h (135 mph ), or the equivalent of a Category 4 on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale</a>. Weakening slightly as its forward motion slowed, Typhoon Sudal passed about south of Yap at 0000 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on April 9, which was its closest approach to the island.

Intensification continued throughout the day on April 9, with the appearance of <a href="Eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">concentric eyewalls</a> on satellite imagery; such a feature is indicative of an intense tropical cyclone. Early on April 10, the JTWC estimated that Sudal attained peak winds of 240 km/h (150 mph ), making the cyclone a <a href="super%20typhoon">super typhoon</a>. At the same time, the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph ), as well as a <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of 940 <a href="bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (27.76 <a href="Inch%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>). Also on that day, Sudal entered the area of warning responsibility of the <a href="Philippine%20Atmospheric%2C%20Geophysical%20and%20Astronomical%20Services%20Administration">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> (PAGASA), which provided the name "Cosme" for local advisories. For several days, the typhoon continued to the northwest, fluctuating in intensity but remaining powerful. On April 12, Sudal turned toward the north and northeast through a weakness in the ridge, and its eye increased to a diameter of about . The next day, the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 230 km/h (145 mph ), although it gradually weakened subsequently due to a combination of increasing upper-level <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> and cooler water temperatures.
Early on April 15, Sudal passed very near the uninhabited Japanese island of <a href="Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a> as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April 15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a>, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on April 18, well east of Japan and far south of the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>.

Early in its duration as a weak tropical storm, Sudal passed near Chuuk state in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). One station reported 17 cm (6.68 inches) of rainfall in a 24‑hour period. The passage of the storm left minor roof damage and some crop damage, due to <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> contaminating groundwater. No deaths or injuries were reported in the state. The storm briefly threatened Guam, and as it passed south of the island, Sudal produced 5.5 m (18 ft) waves and a 0.9 m (3 ft) storm surge. A station at <a href="Apra%20Harbor">Apra Harbor</a> recorded a 69 km/h (43 mph) wind gust, and light rainfall of around was reported, although no damage was reported on the island. High waves also occurred on <a href="Rota%20%28island%29">Rota</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a>. The FSM is an independent nation in <a href="Compact%20of%20Free%20Association">Compact of Free Association</a> with the United States, and the latter nation is responsible for aid and protection.

Further west, Typhoon Sudal intensified quickly as it moved through the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> and later <a href="Yap">Yap</a> state. On <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a>, a wind gust of 132 km/h (82 mph) was reported, and 6.34 inches of rainfall occurred in a 24‑hour period. High waves of over 5 m (18 ft) struck the island, causing severe beach erosion and damaging subsistence crops. The winds downed a few trees and wrecked some poorly built homes. On nearby <a href="Faraulep">Faraulep</a> and <a href="Fais%20Island">Fais</a> islands, similar meteorological conditions and damages were reported. The small <a href="Ngulu%20Atoll">Ngulu Atoll</a> received gale force winds and heavy rainfall, which destroyed half of the island's water storage tanks. Later in its duration, Sudal passed near Iwo Jima, producing wind gusts of 141 km/h (87 mph).

The worst of the damage occurred on the island of Yap. Initially, the typhoon was expected to pass north of the island without affecting it significantly, but instead the island experienced the brunt of the storm. <a href="Typhoon%20Lupit%20%282003%29">Typhoon Lupit</a> affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand the winds of Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up after the storm.
On April 9, the eye of Sudal briefly passed over the southern portion of the island, and winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) struck the island for about four hours. The entire island, only in length, experienced typhoon force winds. <a href="Yap%20International%20Airport">Yap International Airport</a> recorded a peak wind gust of 181 km/h (112 mph); a subsequent survey estimated wind gusts on the island reached 226 km/h (140 mph). Heavy rainfall occurred during Sudal's passage, including 20.0 cm (7.88 inches) in a 48‑hour period at the airport. The lowest pressure on the island was . Along the coast, the typhoon produced waves of 6.7 m (22 ft) in height, along with a 3.7 m (12 ft) <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>; the combination sunk several ships and heavily damaged the island's coral reefs, the latter which is one of Yap's primary tourism attractions.

When Typhoon Sudal struck the island, there were about 8,000 people living on Yap, with about 1,700 houses. The typhoon destroyed 700 homes, and left another 900 damaged; many of the destroyed homes were wooden. Damage was heaviest in the southeastern portion of the island, including in and around <a href="Colonia%2C%20Yap">Colonia</a>, the capital city. The strong winds downed trees across the island. Over 90% of the structures on the island were damaged or destroyed, including the hospital, airport, most government facilities, and the water, power and communications systems. One of the five hotels on the island was also destroyed. About 80% of the residents lost power or water after the storm. In the southeastern portion of the island, high waves wrecked most of the coastal homes, and also severely damaged the seawall. The intrusion of salt water destroyed almost all of the food crops on the island. Following the typhoon's passage, about 1,000 people were left homeless, and another 500 were forced to stay in shelters.

Overall damage from Typhoon Sudal totaled about $14 million (2004 <a href="USD">USD</a>, $16.1 million 2010 USD), most of which on Yap from property damage. Despite the heavy damage, there were no deaths, although there were initial reports of one fatality. Only 8 people required hospital treatment due to injuries, none of them serious. Typhoon Sudal was the strongest typhoon to strike Yap in about 50 years.

Following the passage of Sudal, officials in Yap declared a state of emergency, and a day after the typhoon struck, United States President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> ordered federal disaster aid for the FSM. The latter declaration provided funding for 75% of the debris removal cost and emergency services. Less than a week after the storm, the <a href="Pacific%20Islands%20Forum">Pacific Islands Forum</a> provided $11,500 to Yap for relief efforts. Over the subsequent weeks, the FSM government established a typhoon relief fund of about $250,000. Additionally, the United States government allocated $7,443,000 for relief efforts.

Within a few days, the <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) identified primary concerns for the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and the water from the treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time. Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. Without running water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.

Initially, telephone service onto the island was disrupted, and the only method of outside contact was by radio to the <a href="University%20of%20Guam">University of Guam</a>. The <a href="Guam%20Memorial%20Hospital">Guam Memorial Hospital</a> dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway. About a day after Sudal's passage, the runway was cleared and repaired, which allowed a <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> plane to provide relief supplies, including building materials. By April 12, or three days after the typhoon, communication links to the island began to be restored. By four days later, the water treatment plant was repaired. One power station on the island was repaired, but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% of the population remained without electricity. Primary roadways were largely cleared, and all bridges were reopened.
About two weeks after the typhoon's passage, there were still 500 people in 18 shelters in Colonia, the capital city, as well as about 400 people in shelters elsewhere. Many others were either residing with relatives or staying at their damaged properties. The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> arrived on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators. Officials sent 23 flights of aid to the island, as well as one each to the outlying islands of <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> and <a href="Fais%20Island">Fais</a>. About 76,000 litres (20,000 gallons) of water were sent to the island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief supplies. The Yap hospital was poorly suited to handle the typhoon, due to the lack of medications or emergency medical equipment. About 60 FEMA personnel worked at the hospital, who required additional items, such as their own supply of water and food, to prevent them from acquiring local diseases. During their stay on the island, the group assisted 163 people, mostly for minor issues. Overall, there were about 100 FEMA workers involved on the island, although only 20 stayed there due to lack of hotels and rental cars.

By 26 days after the storm, more than half of the island had power restored, and the cell phone system was fixed. In the weeks and months after the passage of Sudal, water temperatures around Yap decreased from to , due to significant <a href="upwelling">upwelling</a>. The drastic decrease caused unusual amounts of fog over the island, as well as significantly lower tides. By September 2004, rebuilding was still underway, and half of the schools, which had previously been used as shelters, reopened to students. Power and water lines were completely restored. The hospital remained damaged with a temporary roof, and although private businesses quickly re-opened, government buildings took longer to be rebuilt; this was due to the lengthy process of receiving aid from FEMA. Additionally, officials required a land survey to determine where structures were safe to be rebuilt.

Due to the heavy damage on Yap, the name "Sudal" was retired during the 38th session of the <a href="Economic%20and%20Social%20Commission%20for%20Asia%20and%20the%20Pacific">Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific</a> and <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> typhoon committee in November 2005; it was replaced with the name "Mirinae".

1949 Ambato earthquake

The 1949 Ambato earthquake was the largest <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> in the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a> in more than five years. On August 5, 1949, it struck Ecuador's <a href="Tungurahua%20Province">Tungurahua Province</a> southeast of its capital <a href="Ambato%2C%20Ecuador">Ambato</a> and killed 5,050 people. Measuring 6.4 on the scale, it originated from a <a href="hypocenter">hypocenter</a> 15 km beneath the surface. The nearby villages of <a href="Guano%2C%20Ecuador">Guano</a>, <a href="Patate">Patate</a>, <a href="Pelileo">Pelileo</a>, and <a href="Pillaro">Pillaro</a> were destroyed, and the city of Ambato suffered heavy damage. The earthquake flattened buildings and subsequent <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s caused damage throughout the Tungurahua, <a href="Chimborazo%20Province">Chimborazo</a>, and <a href="Cotopaxi%20Province">Cotopaxi Province</a>s. It disrupted water mains and communication lines and opened a fissure into which the small town of <a href="Libertad%2C%20Ecuador">Libertad</a> sank. Moderate shaking from the event extended as far away as <a href="Quito">Quito</a> and <a href="Guayaquil">Guayaquil</a>.

Earthquakes in Ecuador stem from two major interrelated tectonic areas: the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> under the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a> and the <a href="Andean%20Volcanic%20Belt">Andean Volcanic Belt</a>. The 1949 Ambato earthquake initially followed an intersection of several northwest-southeast-trending faults in the Inter-Andean Valley which were created by the subduction of the <a href="Carnegie%20Ridge">Carnegie Ridge</a>. Strata of rock cracked as the earthquake ruptured the faults, sending out powerful shock waves. Today threats exist throughout the country from both <a href="interplate%20earthquake">interplate</a> and <a href="intraplate%20earthquake">intraplate</a> seismicity.

Earthquakes are common in Ecuador. Near the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca</a> <a href="subduction">subduction</a> zone the recorded history of interplate earthquakes spans 80 years. At the time it struck the 1949 Ambato earthquake was the second-worst earthquake in Ecuador's modern history topped only by the <a href="1797%20Riobamba%20earthquake">1797 Riobamba earthquake</a>, and the most devastating earthquake in the Western Hemisphere since the <a href="1944%20San%20Juan%20earthquake">1944 San Juan earthquake</a>. Several major earthquakes have occurred throughout the country since 1949, including the <a href="1987%20Ecuador%20earthquakes">1987 Ecuador earthquakes</a> and the 1997 Ecuador earthquake. The <a href="2007%20Peru%20earthquake">2007 Peru earthquake</a> also affected the country.

Much of South American seismic activity and volcanism originates from subduction of the <a href="oceanic%20crust">oceanic</a> Nazca Plate under the continental <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a> and subduction of the Pacific's <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a> under the South American continent. This seismicity extends for along the continent's western edge and probably stems from a region of northeast-trending <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faulting</a> near the Ecuadorian Trench. The region of faulting may actually function as its own microplate.

The <a href="Carnegie%20Ridge">Carnegie Ridge</a> is sliding under Ecuadorian land, causing coastal uplift and volcanism. The ridge's movement may also have changed the type of faulting along the coast, causing <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Strike-slip%20faults">strike-slip faults</a> (faults that move horizontally past each other). Evidence of this subduction altering the course of faulting is found at the Yaquina fault, which, unlike the rest of the <a href="Panama%20Basin">Panama Basin</a> faults, trends to the west instead of north-south, indicating that the Carnegie Ridge may be colliding with the continental mass of Ecuador. This collision created northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest-trending faults in the region, and with that, caused strong earthquakes in Riobamba in 1797 and <a href="Alausi%2C%20Ecuador">Alausi</a> in 1961. Several of the northwest-southeast-trending faults converge in the <a href="Inter-Andean%20Valley">Inter-Andean Valley</a> where the 1949 Ambato earthquake took place.

The <a href="hypocenter">hypocenter</a> of the earthquake occurred beneath the surface, under a mountain from Ambato. Nearby faults ruptured, breaking rock strata and sending shock waves to the surface capable of bringing down entire buildings. "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" reported that local seismologists first placed the earthquake's magnitude at 7.5, but the official measurement was later revised to 6.8.

The earthquake was preceded by a <a href="foreshock">foreshock</a>, which, although modest, was strong enough to cause chaos and force people to flee from their homes into the streets. The main shock <a href="epicenter">originated</a> southeast of Ambato. When the primary shock hit Ambato's main cathedral and military barracks collapsed, as did most of the city's buildings, scores of young girls preparing for their <a href="First%20Communion">First Communion</a> perished in the cathedral. The shaking ruptured <a href="Water%20supply%20network">water mains</a>, disabled communication lines, opened cracks in the earth, reduced bridges to rubble, and derailed a train. The earthquake demolished buildings in rural <a href="Hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlets</a>; closer to the nearest mountains of the Andes, <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s destroyed roads and blocked rivers. The village of <a href="Libertad%2C%20Ecuador">Libertad</a> near <a href="Pelileo">Pelileo</a> sank into a huge hole about in diameter with all of its 100 inhabitants. Shaking up to <a href="Mercalli%20intensity%20scale">intensity</a> IV extended as far away as <a href="Quito">Quito</a> and <a href="Guayaquil">Guayaquil</a>.

Initial reports (around August 7) estimated the death toll at 2,700 people. The cities of <a href="Patate">Patate</a> and Pelileo suffered the most with 1,000 and 1,300 dead respectively. In <a href="Ambato%2C%20Ecuador">Ambato</a> reports of the death toll ranged from 400 to 500, and the <a href="List%20of%20diplomatic%20missions%20of%20Ecuador">Ecuadorean Embassy in Washington, D.C.</a>, estimated that 1,000 to more than 2,000 people were injured. The town of <a href="Pillaro">Pillaro</a>, destroyed by the quake, had more than 20 dead, and in <a href="Latacunga">Latacunga</a>, 11 were killed and 30 injured; 50 homes, two churches, and the local government building were also ruined. Fifteen other towns and cities were also badly affected, including <a href="Guano%2C%20Ecuador">Guano</a> which was devastated.

Later counts assumed around 3,200 casualties in Pelileo; the total death toll estimates were adjusted to around 4,000 people. Officials reported that many of the dead had been inside buildings as they buckled or were killed by flooding brought about by the blockage of a <a href="Ditch">drainage canal</a>. Others were crushed by landslides from nearby mountains. No homes in the city of Pelileo were left standing, many buildings were flattened, and large cracks formed in the ground. In Ambato alone 75 percent of the homes still standing had to be demolished. On August 8, an <a href="aftershock">aftershock</a> with "considerable strength" struck near Ambato.

The final death toll according to the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> was 5,050. The earthquake severely affected some 30 communities and left approximately 100,000 people homeless.

Ecuador's <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Ecuador">President</a> <a href="Galo%20Plaza">Galo Plaza Lasso</a> flew to Ambato to take personal charge of the primary relief efforts. Plaza directed rescue efforts for two days as airlifts from Quito dropped supplies. A group of Red Cross volunteers and medical supplies were sent on American aircraft. The United States Army sent two relief teams equipped with serum and blood plasma. The mayor of Miami along with seven other politicians began a fund-raising campaign for medical needs and clothing and coordinated the distribution of of <a href="Rexall">Rexall</a> drugs. Several nearby countries sent airplanes carrying medicine and food. A local fund-raising effort collected 250,000 <a href="Ecuadorian%20sucre">Ecuadorian sucre</a>s (approximately US$14,815 1949) within two hours of its launch. Plaza said "We have not lost our courage. Neither Ambato nor Ecuador shall cry any more, but begin to work."

On August 7 a plane carrying 34 rescue workers from the <a href="Shell%20Oil%20Company">Shell Oil Company</a> crashed from Ambato leaving no survivors. Disease began to spread in Pelileo within days of the earthquake, which prompted a team of American soldiers, acting as relief workers, to order water purification devices and <a href="DDT">DDT</a> airdrops to cleanse the area of airborne agents. Sick victims were quarantined and prevented from leaving the city.

The earthquake considerably impacted a number of cities: it destroyed Guano, Patate, Pelileo, Pillaro, and one-third of Ambato. The city of Ambato was a "scene of anguish and pain" described by "scores of little funerals winding their way through the debris". The brand-new hospital had been reduced to four walls, and most of the buildings in town were demolished. In Pelileo relief workers found victims feeding buried people through holes in the ground. In the days following the earthquakes aftershocks occurred and torrential rains ensued.

In an effort to help the inhabitants a festival of fruit and flowers was held on June 29, 1950. The festival was a success and became an annual event that is celebrated each year during <a href="Carnival">Carnaval</a> and is now an important tourist attraction. Ambato was completely rebuilt after the earthquake. The city's main church, the Iglesia Matriz de Ambato, was replaced by a new cathedral known as Iglesia La Catedral in 1954. Pelileo was rebuilt on a new site from its previous location.

Ambato is frequently visited by tourists traveling on the <a href="Pan-American%20Highway">Pan-American Highway</a>. The city is well known for its extensive market, which sells a wide array of items, including local delicacies and flowers, and for its "quintas" — old estates that serve as historic parks — some of which pre-date the earthquake.

Ecuador is still at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and interplate earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, as it can be much more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, <a href="subsidence">subsidence</a>, and even <a href="soil%20liquefaction">soil liquefaction</a>.

Ex parte Crow Dog

Ex parte Crow Dog, 109 U.S. 556 (1883), is a decision of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> that followed the death of one member of a <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> tribe at the hands of another on <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservation</a> land. <a href="Crow%20Dog">Crow Dog</a> was a member of the <a href="Brul%C3%A9">Brulé</a> band of the <a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a> Sioux. On August 5, 1881 he shot and killed <a href="Spotted%20Tail">Spotted Tail</a>, a Lakota chief; there are different accounts of the background to the killing. The tribal council dealt with the incident according to <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a> tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution to the dead man's family. However, the U.S. authorities then prosecuted Crow Dog for <a href="murder">murder</a> in a federal court. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang. 

The defendant then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>, arguing that the federal court had no jurisdiction to try cases where the offense had already been tried by the tribal council. The court found unanimously for the plaintiff and Crow Dog was therefore released. This case was the first time in history that an Indian was held on trial for the murder of another Indian. The case led to the <a href="Major%20Crimes%20Act">Major Crimes Act</a> in 1885, which placed some major crimes (initially seven, now 15) under federal jurisdiction if committed by an Indian against another Indian on a reservation or tribal land. This case was the beginning of the <a href="plenary%20power">plenary power</a> legal doctrine that has been used in Indian case law to limit <a href="Tribal%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">tribal sovereignty</a>.

Crow Dog was a <a href="Brul%C3%A9">Brulé</a> subchief who lived on the <a href="Great%20Sioux%20Reservation">Great Sioux Reservation</a>, in the part that is now the <a href="Rosebud%20Indian%20Reservation">Rosebud Indian Reservation</a> in south-central <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> on its border with <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>. The tribe had made several treaties with the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the most significant being the 1868 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Laramie%20%281868%29">Treaty of Fort Laramie</a>. This treaty provided that Indians agreed to turn over those accused of crimes to the <a href="Indian%20agent">Indian agent</a>, a representative of the U.S. government in Indian affairs. The treaty also stipulated that tribal members would stay on the reservation provided (which included the <a href="Black%20Hills">Black Hills</a>) unless three-fourths of the adult male tribal members agreed otherwise. In 1874, Colonel <a href="George%20Armstrong%20Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a> led a party into the Black Hills to investigate rumors of gold. Once he announced the discovery of gold on <a href="French%20Creek%20%28Cheyenne%20River%29">French Creek</a>, the <a href="Black%20Hills%20Gold%20Rush">Black Hills Gold Rush</a> brought prospectors into that area in violation of the Fort Laramie treaty. The Lakota protested in 1875 to no avail, as the United States demanded that the Lakota sell the Black Hills. The United States then declared the Lakota as hostile, which started the <a href="Great%20Sioux%20War%20of%201876">Black Hills War</a>. The war included the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Rosebud">Battle of the Rosebud</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Little%20Bighorn">Battle of the Little Bighorn</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Slim%20Buttes">Battle of Slim Buttes</a>, among others. The war ended in 1877. Crow Dog fought in this war, while the man he later killed, <a href="Spotted%20Tail">Spotted Tail</a>, did not. Congress passed a law later in 1877 () that took the Black Hills away from the tribe, contrary to the language of the treaty.

On August 5, 1881 Crow Dog shot and killed Spotted Tail, who was the uncle of <a href="Oglala%20Lakota">Oglala Lakota</a> war leader <a href="Crazy%20Horse">Crazy Horse</a>. Spotted Tail had not been selected as a chief by the tribe, but instead had been appointed by General <a href="George%20Crook">George Crook</a> in 1876, which hurt him in the view of many of the tribe. He was viewed as an accommodationist and the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> (BIA) referred to him as the "great peace chief." He also supervised the <a href="Indian%20agency%20police">tribal police</a> of about 300 men. In contrast, Crow Dog was a traditionalist and although he had been a captain in the tribal police, he was fired by Spotted Tail sometime after a July 4, 1881, confrontation during which Crow Dog pointed a rifle at Spotted Tail.

On August 5, tensions further escalated at a tribal meeting where a number of tribal members criticized Spotted Tail for taking Light-in-the-Lodge, the wife of Medicine Bear, a crippled man, into his household as his second wife. It was believed that the killing occurred that day as the result of Crow Dog and Spotted Tail meeting, both armed, and mistaking the other man's intentions. In another version of the story, Crow Dog was appointed by the tribal council to head the tribal police, which undermined the authority of Spotted Tail. Crow Dog discovered that Spotted Tail was taking money from ranchers for "grazing rights" and he denounced him for it, while Spotted Tail defended the practice. A later conflict with the Indian agent forced the tribal police to disband, and Crow Dog lost his position. This version makes no mention of another man's wife being the reason for the killing, and states that Crow Dog ambushed Spotted Tail to gain power in the tribe. There is no consensus among historians as to which events happened as described.

In either case, the matter was settled within the tribe, following longstanding tribal custom, by Crow Dog making a <a href="restitution">restitution</a> payment of $600, eight horses, and one blanket to Spotted Tail's family.

Following the killing and the settlement under tribal customs, the Indian agent had Crow Dog arrested and taken to Fort Niobrara, Nebraska. Within 20 days, the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a> concluded that the Federal Enclave Act of 1854 as modified by the <a href="Assimilative%20Crimes%20Act">Assimilative Crimes Act</a> allowed the territorial death penalty to be applied to Crow Dog. In September 1881, Crow Dog was indicted by a federal <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> for <a href="murder">murder</a> and <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> under the laws of the <a href="Dakota%20Territory">Dakota Territory</a>. In March 1882 the case was heard by Judge <a href="Gideon%20C.%20Moody">Gideon C. Moody</a> at the First Judicial District Court of Dakota, located in <a href="Deadwood%2C%20South%20Dakota">Deadwood</a>, South Dakota. The court appointed A. J. Plowman to represent Crow Dog, who claimed that he had been punished and made reparations according to the customs of the Brulé Sioux tribe. According to a contemporary news report of the Deadwood Times it was the first time "in the history of the country, <nowiki>[that]</nowiki> an Indian is held for trial for the murder of another Indian." The trial was viewed at the time as a sham, and despite testimonies from Indian witnesses stating that Spotted Tail had killed a rival once before, that Spotted Tail drew a pistol on Crow Dog, and that Spotted Tail's intention was to kill Crow Dog, Crow Dog was convicted and sentenced to be hanged on May 11, 1882. The prosecution had presented five Indian witnesses who stated that Spotted Tail was ambushed, and some witnesses stated he was unarmed. In an unusual move for a death penalty case, Moody released Crow Dog, allowing him to go home pending his appeal to the territorial Supreme Court. Surprising many of the white citizens of the area, Crow Dog returned to court as required. In May 1882, the territorial Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, and the execution was rescheduled for May 11, 1883. Crow Dog then petitioned the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> for a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" and the Supreme Court accepted the case.

Justice <a href="Stanley%20Matthews%20%28lawyer%29">Stanley Matthews</a> delivered the opinion of the unanimous court. Matthews noted that Crow Dog was indicted for murder under a statute prohibiting murder on federal land. Matthews then looked at the federal laws dealing with Indians, including a statute that applied the prohibition on murder to Indian reservations and another covering exceptions to prosecution. The first statute prohibited murder on federal land, the second statute applied the first statute to reservations, and the last had specific exceptions to prosecution. Matthews felt that this last section was the most critical one in the case, with the section stating unequivocally that federal law: "shall not be construed to extend to <nowiki>[crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to]</nowiki> any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe" (brackets in original). Matthews rejected the contention of the United States that the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie implicitly repealed the exceptions to prosecution. He stated that since the law had not been amended or changed, and since implied repeals are not favored unless the implication is necessary, to allow such a repeal would be to reverse the general policy of the United States. Matthews said that such a repeal required a "clear expression of the intention of Congress," which was not present in the case. In a clear evocation of the principle of tribal sovereignty, Matthews stated:

It tries them, not by their peers, nor by the customs of their people, nor the law of their land, but by superiors of a different race, according to the law of a social state of which they have an imperfect conception, and which is opposed to the traditions of their history, to the habits of their lives, to the strongest prejudices of their savage nature; one which measures the red man's revenge by the maxims of the white man's morality.

As a result, the Court concluded, the First Judicial District Court of Dakota was without jurisdiction to hear the case. The writ of "habeas corpus" was issued, discharging Crow Dog from federal custody.

Shocked by the Supreme Court's decision and under strong pressure from the BIA, Congress passed the <a href="Major%20Crimes%20Act">Major Crimes Act</a> in response. The Major Crimes Act placed seven serious felony offenses (with amendments over the years, now fifteen) under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Those wishing to <a href="Cultural%20assimilation%20of%20Native%20Americans">assimilate</a> Indians into mainstream white society wanted to do away with the "heathen" tribal laws and apply white laws to the tribes. The BIA had also been attempting since 1874 to extend federal jurisdiction over major crimes to reservations, without any success. Beginning in 1882, the <a href="Indian%20Rights%20Association">Indian Rights Association</a> (IRA) also tried to extend federal jurisdiction, but in a different manner. The IRA believed that the tribes would be better served by a completely separate court system, modeled after U.S. courts and called agency courts. The only appeal would be to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The BIA opposed that approach, preferring to try only major crimes in the nearest federal court. "<a href="Ex%20parte">Ex parte</a> Crow Dog" provided the BIA a perfect example of why this was needed, along with an incident involving Spotted Tail's son, Spotted Tail, Jr., in which the younger Spotted Tail participated in a fight during which three Brulé were killed. The younger Spotted Tail was also confined pending murder charges, and it took a direct order of the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a> for the local BIA agents to comply with the Supreme Court decision before he was released. The BIA also implemented regulations in 1883 criminalizing traditional tribal practices such as war dances and polygamy. Between the BIA's efforts and the IRA efforts, the law was passed in 1885, making seven offenses federal crimes. Many members of the Indian tribes were bitter with this outcome for decades afterwards. <a href="Wayne%20Ducheneaux">Wayne Ducheneaux</a>, president of the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20American%20Indians">National Congress of American Indians</a>, testified before Congress on the matter in 1968:

Before all this came about we had our own method of dealing with law-breakers and in settling disputes between members. That all changed when Crow Dog killed Spotted Tail. Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe. But that was considered too barbaric, and thought perhaps we should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that said we don't know how to handle murderers and they were going to show us.

In 2000, <a href="Larry%20Echo%20Hawk">Larry Echo Hawk</a>, a <a href="Pawnee%20people">Pawnee</a> who had been the <a href="State%20attorney%20general">Attorney General</a> of <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> and was later the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs%23Commissioners%20and%20Assistant%20Secretaries">Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs</a>, noted that: "The Major Crimes Act was designed to give the federal government authority to criminally prosecute seven specific major crimes committed by Indians in Indian Country. It was a direct assault on the sovereign authority of tribal government over tribal members."

"Crow Dog" had a tremendous impact on <a href="Tribal%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">tribal sovereignty</a>. The decision recognized two distinct concepts in addition to those related to criminal law. First, Justice Matthews had noted that under "<a href="Cherokee%20Nation%20v.%20Georgia">Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</a>", (1831) the Brulé tribe had a right to its own law in <a href="Indian%20country">Indian country</a>. Part of this ruling was based on American constitutional tradition – at that time, not all Indians were U.S. citizens and according to Matthews did not have a "voice in the selection of representatives and the framing of the laws." The case held that Indian tribes retain sovereignty, and is still valid law. For example, "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Lara">United States v. Lara</a>", (2004) cited "Crow Dog" when holding that both a tribe and the federal government could prosecute Lara, as they were separate sovereigns. Subsequent cases have supported the concept "that tribal Indians living in Indian country are citizens of the United States first (under the <a href="plenary%20power">plenary power</a> doctrine), the tribes second, and the states third, and then only to the extent that Congress chooses."

Currently the tribes are authorized to operate their own courts, not as a right of tribal sovereignty, but under a federal law. As of 2007, about half of the federally recognized tribes have tribal courts. The power of these courts was limited to minor crimes with a maximum punishment of a $5,000 fine and imprisonment of no more than one year until the passage of the <a href="Tribal%20Law%20and%20Order%20Act%20of%202010">Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010</a>. Under this new act, tribes may sentence offenders for up to three years per offense and a $15,000 fine. As a result of Crow Dog and ensuing legislation, jurisdiction in Indian country is complex, as shown by the following table:

The court also created the plenary power doctrine, holding that the federal court did not have jurisdiction because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away the rights of the tribe. "Crow Dog" was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with "Cherokee Nation"; the next major case, "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Kagama">United States v. Kagama</a>", (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress to enact any law that it wanted to pass, over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the <a href="Medicine%20Lodge%20Treaty">Medicine Lodge Treaty</a> with the <a href="Kiowa%20people">Kiowa</a> by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. The use of this power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.

Suillus pungens

Suillus pungens, commonly known as the pungent slippery jack or the pungent suillus, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the genus "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>". The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of the fungus have slimy convex <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> up to

An <a href="mycorrhizae">ectomycorrhizal</a> species, "S. pungens" forms an intimate <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> relationship between its underground <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> and the young roots of the associated <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> tree. The fungus—limited in distribution to <a href="California">California</a>—fruits almost exclusively with <a href="Monterey%20pine">Monterey</a> and <a href="bishop%20pine">bishop pine</a>, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast of the United States</a>. Several studies have investigated the role of "S. pungens" in the <a href="coastal%20California">coastal California</a>n forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, it is not a dominant root colonizer, and occupies only a small percentage of <a href="ectomycorrhizal">ectomycorrhizal</a> root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.

The fungus was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> scientifically by American mycologists <a href="Harry%20D.%20Thiers">Harry D. Thiers</a> and <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> in their 1964 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on North American "Suillus" species. The <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> collection was made on the campus of <a href="San%20Francisco%20State%20University">San Francisco State University</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Smith and Thiers <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classified</a> "S. pungens" in <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Suilli"—a grouping of related species characterized by the presence of either a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> on the stipe, a <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> adhering to the cap margin, or a "false veil" not attached to the stipe but initially covering the tube cavity.

A 1996 <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular analysis</a> of 38 different "Suillus" species used the <a href="nucleic%20acid%20sequence">sequences</a> of their <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a>s to infer <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> relationships and clarify the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of the genus. The results suggest that "S. pungens" was genetically similar to "<a href="Suillus%20collinitus">S. collinitus</a>", "<a href="Suillus%20neoalbidipes">S. neoalbidipes</a>", "<a href="Suillus%20pseudobrevipes">S. pseudobrevipes</a>", "<a href="Suillus%20luteus">S. luteus</a>", "<a href="Suillus%20brevipes">S. brevipes</a>", "<a href="Suillus%20weaverae">S. weaverae</a>", and certain <a href="genetic%20isolate">isolates</a> of "<a href="Suillus%20granulatus">S. granulatus</a>".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "pungens", and refers to the pungent aroma of the fruit bodies. The mushroom is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "pungent slippy jack" or the "pungent suillus". It has also been referred to as the "slippery jack", a common name applied to several "Suillus" species.

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of "S. pungens" is roughly convex when young, becoming plano-convex (flat on one side and rounded on the other) to somewhat flat with age, and reaches diameters of . The cap surface is sticky to slimy when moist, becoming shiny when dried. The surface is smooth but is sometimes streaked with the sticky glue-like cap slime when older. The cap color is highly variable in this species, and the cap is often <a href="variegation">variegated</a> with a mixture of light and dark colors. When young it is dirty-white to <a href="olive%20%28color%29">olive</a> with pale olive splotches. Maturing caps can retain the color they had when young, or become <a href="tawny%20%28color%29">tawny</a> to orange-yellow to reddish-brown, or a combination of these colors. The cap margin is initially rolled inward and has a cottony roll of white tissue, but becomes naked and curves downward with age. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thick, white and unchanging in young fruit bodies, frequently changing to yellow when older.

The tubes that comprise the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> (spore-bearing tissue) on the underside of the cap are up to long, <a href="adnation">adnate</a> when young, becoming decurrent or nearly so with age. In young specimens, they are whitish to pale <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a>, and are covered with milky droplets that become brown to <a href="ochre">ochraceous</a> when dried. As specimens mature the color of the pore surface changes to yellowish, and finally to dark yellow. The angular pores, which are 1–1.5 mm in diameter, are not radially arranged, and do not change color when bruised. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> is solid (rather than hollow), long, and thick near the top. Its shape is variable: either roughly equal in width throughout, thicker at the base, or somewhat thicker in the middle. Its surface is dry and smooth, and covered with irregularly shaped glandular dots. The dots—minute clumps of <a href="pigment">pigment</a>ed cells—are initially reddish before becoming brownish. The background color of the stipe is initially whitish (roughly the same color as the tubes), but becomes more yellow with age. It does not change color when bruised, and does not have a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>. The flesh of the stipe is white, and does not change color when exposed to air.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is olive-brown to pale cinnamon-brown. Individual <a href="spore">spore</a>s are thin-walled, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), and smooth. Their shape is <a href="wikt%3Aellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> to roughly cylindrical in face view or <a href="wikt%3Ainequilateral">inequilateral</a> when viewed in profile, and they measure 9.5–10 by 2.8–3.5 <a href="Micrometre">μm</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are hyaline, club-shaped and four-spored, with dimensions of 33–36 by 8–10 μm. The thin-walled <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> are rare to scattered on the tube surface but abundant on the pores, where they usually occur in massive clusters. They appear dark brown when mounted in a dilute (3%) solution of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH), and are cylindric to roughly club-shaped, measuring 43–79 by 7–10 μm. They are usually encrusted with pigment, although some may be hyaline. The tissue comprising the tube is hyaline, and made of divergent to nearly parallel hyphae that are 3–5 μm wide. The <a href="pileipellis">pileipellis</a> is a tissue type known as an ixotrichodermium (made of interwoven gelatinized hyphae); it stains brown in KOH, and is made of hyphae that are 4–5 μm wide. The stipe cuticle is made of clusters of cystidia similar to those found in the hymenium. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are absent in the hyphae of "S. pungens".

Several <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">chemical tests</a> can be employed in the field to aid in the identification of "S. pungens". With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn <a href="wine%20%28color%29">vinaceous</a> (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a> (NHOH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. <a href="Iron%28II%29%20sulfate">Iron(II) sulfate</a> (FeSO) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.

The mushroom is considered <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, but not choice. Its taste is harsh, nauseating, and weakly acidic; the odor is strong and ranges from pleasant, resembling bananas, to pungent. When collecting for the table, young specimens are preferred, as older ones "literally seethe with fat, agitated maggots and sag with so much excess moisture that they practically demand to be wrung out like a sponge!" Michael Kuo's "100 Edible Mushrooms" (2007) rates the mushroom's edibility as "bad" and warns that dishes cooked with the mushroom will assume an unpleasant taste.

"Suillus pungens" is characterized by the very distinct color changes that occur in the cap as it develops. The range of color variation makes it possible to misidentify the species with others whose color overlaps. "Suillus pungens" has been misidentified as "<a href="Suillus%20placidus">S. placidus</a>" because of the white color of the young fruit bodies and the droplets of exudate. "S. placidus" has a wider distribution, is usually found in association with <a href="eastern%20white%20pine">eastern white pine</a>, is generally smaller, with a maximum cap diameter up to , and has smaller spores, measuring 7–9 by 2.5–3.2 μm. It does not have any distinctive taste or odor. North American "<a href="Suillus%20granulatus">S. granulatus</a>" is another potential lookalike species, and at maturity it is nearly identical to "Suillus pungens". The cap of "S. granulatus" is variable in color, ranging from pale yellow to various shades of brown, while the pore surface is initially whitish, later becoming yellowish, and similar to "S. placidus", its typical host is <a href="eastern%20white%20pine">eastern white pine</a>. Unlike "S. pungens", it lacks a characteristic odor and taste. The Californian species "<a href="Suillus%20glandulosipes">Suillus glandulosipes</a>" has veil material attached to the edge of the cap when young. It also lacks the distinctive changes in cap color during development, is associated with <a href="lodgepole%20pine">lodgepole pine</a>, has smaller spores (6.6–8.8 by 2.5–3 μm), and lacks any obvious taste and odor. Another Californian species, "<a href="Suillus%20quiescens">Suillus quiescens</a>", newly described in 2010, may resemble "S. pungens", especially at maturity. "S. quiescens" can be distinguished by its lack of white or olive colors when young and by a less glandular stipe when mature.

"Suillus pungens" is an ectomycorrhizal (EM) basidiomycete that forms <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationships almost exclusively with <a href="Monterey%20pine">Monterey pine</a> ("Pinus radiata") and <a href="bishop%20pine">bishop pine</a> ("Pinus muricata"); some collections have been made under <a href="knobcone%20pine">knobcone pine</a> ("Pinus attenuata") and <a href="ponderosa%20pine">ponderosa pine</a> ("Pinus ponderosa"), but only within the range of Monterey pine. All these trees have small scattered natural ranges largely restricted to <a href="California">California</a>. An EM symbiosis is a <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> relationship between an EM fungus and the root tip of a compatible EM plant. The fruit bodies of "Suillus pungens" grow solitarily, scattered or in groups in <a href="humus">humus</a>. They are often found growing near fruit bodies of "<a href="Chroogomphus%20vinicolor">Chroogomphus vinicolor</a>" and "<a href="Helvella%20lacunosa">Helvella lacunosa</a>". "Suillus pungens" is often the most abundant "Suillus" in the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco, where it occurs in abundance during the fall and winter seasons. Although it occurs most frequently in the autumn and winter, it is one of the few species of "Suillus" that continue to fruit sporadically throughout the year, especially in wet weather. It has also been identified in the southeastern <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> and on <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Island">Santa Cruz Island</a>.

A <a href="genet%20%28biology%29">genet</a> is a group of genetically identical individuals that have grown in a given location, all originating <a href="vegetative%20reproduction">vegetatively</a> from a single ancestor. Once established, genets vegetatively spread <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e out from the root tip into the soil and may connect two or more trees to form a network of mycorrhizae. In field studies, the approximate size of fungal genets is typically estimated by collecting and mapping fruit bodies on a site, determining which fruit bodies are genetically identical by either <a href="somatic%20incompatibility">somatic incompatibility</a> (a method fungi use to distinguish self from non-self by delimiting their own <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> from that of other individuals of the same species) or various <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular</a> techniques, and then determining the distance between identical fruit bodies. In a 1996 study, mycologists Monique Gardes and Thomas Bruns hypothesized that "S. pungens", an abundant fruiter in pine forests, would be dominant on the roots of the pine trees. However, by sampling underground ectomycorrhizae in addition to above-ground fruit bodies, they found that the fungus can fruit prolifically while occupying only a small fraction of the ectomycorrhizal root assemblage, which was otherwise dominated by "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>" species and "<a href="Tomentella%20sublilacina">Tomentella sublilacina</a>". Gardes and Bruns hypothesized that the disparity between above- and below-ground representation may be because the fungus invests less energy in vegetative growth and persistence and more in fruiting, or alternatively, because the species is particularly efficient at acquiring carbon from its hosts and so needs to colonize only a few rootlets to obtain enough to allow abundant fruiting. A 1998 study by Pierluigi Bonello and colleagues used <a href="single-strand%20conformation%20polymorphism">single-strand conformation polymorphism</a> analysis to detect minute genetic differences among "S. pungens" genets, and showed that most of the fruiting occurred from a single large genet. This result indicates that the fungus persists because of extensive vegetative growth, rather than frequent establishment of new genets from spores, and that it uses carbon resources efficiently. The study also described an "S. pungens" genet with an area of approximately and a span greater than across, which was at the time the largest EM fungal genet reported. The large "S. pungens" genet was not detected after <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>, demonstrating that it did not survive in the absence of a host, and suggesting that spores are the primary means by which the fungus recolonizes after a fire.

No Rest for the Wicked (Supernatural)

"No Rest for the Wicked" is the sixteenth and final episode of the <a href="Supernatural%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> of <a href="The%20CW">The CW</a> television series "<a href="Supernatural%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Supernatural</a>", and the show's sixtieth episode overall. Written by series creator <a href="Eric%20Kripke">Eric Kripke</a> and directed by <a href="Kim%20Manners">Kim Manners</a>, the episode was first broadcast on May 15, 2008. The narrative follows the series' protagonists <a href="Sam%20Winchester">Sam</a> (<a href="Jared%20Padalecki">Jared Padalecki</a>) and <a href="Dean%20Winchester">Dean Winchester</a> (<a href="Jensen%20Ackles">Jensen Ackles</a>)—brothers who travel the continental <a href="United%20States">United States</a> hunting supernatural creatures—as they attempt to save the latter's soul from damnation. Having made a year-long demonic pact in the previous season finale, Dean has just one day left to live. The brothers must track down the demonic overlord <a href="Lilith%20%28Supernatural%29">Lilith</a>, who holds Dean's contract. Lilith, meanwhile, is entertaining herself by possessing a young girl (<a href="Sierra%20McCormick">Sierra McCormick</a>) and terrorizing her family, a homage to the "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">Twilight Zone</a>" episode "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Good%20Life%20%28The%20Twilight%20Zone%29">It's a Good Life</a>".

Marking the final appearance of <a href="Katie%20Cassidy">Katie Cassidy</a> as the demon <a href="Ruby%20%28Supernatural%29">Ruby</a>, the episode was originally intended to feature the return of <a href="Samantha%20Ferris">Samantha Ferris</a> as recurring character <a href="Ellen%20Harvelle">Ellen Harvelle</a>. The writers initially intended that Sam would save Dean by giving in to his demonic abilities, but the <a href="2007%E2%80%932008%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike</a> prevented the development of that storyline throughout the season. Dean is instead killed; the final scene of him in Hell was the "most complicated shot [the] visual effects department has ever done".

The episode received high ratings for the season, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. The decision to follow through with Dean's Hell-bound contract was praised, as were the performances of Padalecki and Ackles. General consensus was that McCormick was "creepy" as Lilith, but lacked the menace of <a href="Fredric%20Lehne">Fredric Lehne</a>'s <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a> of the <a href="Supernatural%20%28season%202%29">second season</a>.

"Supernatural" follows brothers <a href="Sam%20Winchester">Sam</a> (Padalecki) and <a href="Dean%20Winchester">Dean Winchester</a> (Ackles) as they travel the continental <a href="United%20States">United States</a> hunting supernatural creatures that pose a threat to society. At times, they are assisted by fellow "hunter" and family friend <a href="Bobby%20Singer">Bobby Singer</a> (<a href="Jim%20Beaver">Jim Beaver</a>). Their greatest enemies come in the form of demons, corrupted human souls that have escaped from Hell. A cloud of black smoke in their true form, they take possession of human hosts.

Twenty-two years earlier than the series' main storyline, the demonic tyrant <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a> fed his blood to Sam and other infants, to imbue them with demonic abilities. He gathers them together in the second-season finale "<a href="All%20Hell%20Breaks%20Loose%20%28Supernatural%29">All Hell Breaks Loose</a>" and coerces the young adults into a fight to the death to determine a leader for his demonic army. Sam is killed by the super-strong Jake Talley, but Dean sells his own soul to a <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Crossroads%20Demon">crossroads demon</a> in exchange for Sam's resurrection, a contract that leaves Dean with only a year to live. The Winchesters, Bobby, and fellow hunter <a href="Ellen%20Harvelle">Ellen Harvelle</a> kill Jake and Azazel, but are too late to prevent the release of hundreds of demons from Hell.

One of the freed demons is <a href="Ruby%20%28Supernatural%29">Ruby</a> (Cassidy), a former witch who claims to oppose the demonic world. She frequently helps the brothers throughout the third season with her <a href="Supernatural%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29%23Ruby%27s%20knife">demon-killing knife</a> and knowledge of witchcraft, but Dean mistrusts her manipulative nature. As the deadline approaches, the Winchesters learn that Azazel's successor, <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Lilith">Lilith</a>, holds the contract to Dean's deal. He now only has one day remaining before he is sent to Hell.

The episode begins with <a href="Dean%20Winchester">Dean Winchester</a> (Ackles) being chased through a forest by a <a href="hellhound">hellhound</a>; as it mauls him, he awakens from his dream. His brother, <a href="Sam%20Winchester">Sam</a> (Padalecki), tells him that Bobby has devised a way to locate Lilith, but unconvinced that it will succeed, Dean suggests he live up the rest of his time. Sam insists that he will be saved, but Dean feigns reassurance as he hallucinates a demonic-looking Sam.

Bobby tracks Lilith to New Harmony, Indiana. Dean does not want to attack unprepared, but he refuses to seek help from Ruby. Sam secretly summons her and asks for her knife, and Ruby tells him that his dormant psychic abilities could easily kill Lilith, whose guard is down as she is on "shore leave". Sam considers the alternative, but Dean shows up and tricks Ruby into a devil's trap—mystical symbols capable of rendering a demon powerless—and the brothers take her knife and leave. Despite Dean's objections, Bobby insists that he accompany them, and draws attention to Dean's hallucinations. With his demise rapidly approaching, Dean has begun "piercing the veil", allowing him to glimpse the demons' true forms.

When the trio arrive in New Harmony, they discover that Lilith is possessing a young girl (McCormick) and terrorizing her family. Pretending to be their daughter, Lilith kills the family dog when it is "mean" towards her and snaps the grandfather's neck after he seeks help from neighbors. As Bobby blesses a waterline running to the sprinklers of the family's home, Sam and Dean dispatch some of the demons who have taken over the neighborhood. Ruby appears and angrily confronts them, but is stopped short by an oncoming horde of demons. The three of them run into the house as Bobby activates the sprinklers, creating a barrier of holy water. While Dean takes the girl's father to safety in the basement, Sam and Ruby go upstairs and split up in search of Lilith. Sam finds the possessed girl in her bedroom, and although initially hesitant he prepares to strike until he is stopped by Dean, who reveals that Lilith has left her. As midnight approaches, they take the rest of the family into the basement.

Sam begs Ruby to teach him how to use his abilities, but she tells him that it is too late. Dean accepts his fate as the clock strikes midnight, but runs from the approaching hellhound. The three barricade themselves inside a room, but Dean quickly realizes that Lilith has taken over Ruby's host. Claiming to have sent Ruby "far, far away", Lilith telekinetically pins the brothers down and lets in the hellhound. As Dean is mauled to death, Lilith blasts Sam with white energy from her hand. Horrified to see that it has no effect, she flees her host before Sam can retaliate. A devastated Sam cradles Dean, whose soul is then shown in Hell hanging from a vast landscape of chains and meathooks while fruitlessly screaming for Sam.

"No Rest for the Wicked" marked the final appearance of <a href="Katie%20Cassidy">Katie Cassidy</a> as the demon <a href="Ruby%20%28Supernatural%29">Ruby</a>. Dismissed for budgetary reasons, the actress was replaced by <a href="Genevieve%20Cortese">Genevieve Cortese</a> for the <a href="Supernatural%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a>. The writers intended <a href="Samantha%20Ferris">Samantha Ferris</a> to return as hunter <a href="Ellen%20Harvelle">Ellen Harvelle</a>, a guest stint Ferris believed would have ended in her character's demise. She ultimately declined the offer because it "could cost [her] money and work". Following the <a href="Lilith">mythological Lilith</a>'s role of "destroyer of children", the demon takes on a child host portrayed by <a href="Sierra%20McCormick">Sierra McCormick</a>. Series writer <a href="Sera%20Gamble">Sera Gamble</a> commented that it was an "interesting" choice because it presented Lilith as "creepy and kind of molesty".

Originally entitled "No Quarter", the episode was written by series creator <a href="Eric%20Kripke">Eric Kripke</a>. Much of the storyline served as a homage to the "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">Twilight Zone</a>" episode "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Good%20Life%20%28The%20Twilight%20Zone%29">It's a Good Life</a>", in which a powerful child terrorizes his town. Although Kripke found it difficult to write many of the episode's scenes, the terrorizing sequences "just came right out" because they were "just so fun".
The writers initially intended that Sam would save Dean from Hell, possibly even before "No Rest for the Wicked", by giving in to his demonic powers and becoming "this fully operational dark force" who would then want to go after Lilith. The battle would have been "much more climactic", with the Winchesters "going to war to save Dean's life". By the middle of the season, however, the writers realized the costs associated with depicting such an engagement and scaled it down. To make matters worse, the <a href="2007%E2%80%932008%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike</a> prevented them from fleshing out Sam's evolving abilities throughout the season, and his entire story arc was pushed back into the fourth season. With Sam's storyline no longer dovetailing with Dean's, the writers "[never had] any doubt in [their] minds" to send Dean to Hell. Kripke disliked that the second-season finale "just ended", and he felt that this episode provided a cliffhanger ending that had people "biting their nails". Although the viewers' expectations that Dean would be saved was "reason enough", his imprisonment in Hell also served as a "turning point" for both the character and the series. Kripke commented, "You need huge moves to happen that can cause radical shifts in the characters, that set them off in a new direction. So what happens to Dean in Hell and how Dean gets out become primary concerns of season four."

The episode's final moments linger on Dean "meat-hooked in the center of what looks like a thousand mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as "<a href="M.%20C.%20Escher">M. C. Escher</a> meets "<a href="Hellraiser">Hellraiser</a>"". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present "one epic glimpse" of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the "waiting room"—the place "they stick you before they hand you the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".

The sequence was miserable for Ackles, who spent four hours in make-up having the various hooks and other prosthetics applied. Wired cuffs around his wrists and ankles, as well as a harness around his waist, were used to lift him 13 feet into the air in front of a <a href="Chroma%20key">green screen</a>. To his discomfort, the harness slipped, causing its buckle to continuously dig into his hip throughout the scene's three or four takes. The actor, who "had tears rolling down [his] face" as he was lowered down, deemed it the most physical pain he has endured for a single shot.

The visual effects department also found it quite a challenge, often referring to the ten-day process as the "Hell Shot". Initially planned as 12–13 seconds, the shot ended up running 35 seconds, a huge feat to render on high-definition film. They were also required to digitally remove the wires attached to Ackles, and add in chains. Lightning strikes occur throughout the scene, based on practical lightning effects done during the shoot to meet Manners' and cinematographer Serge Ladouceur's demands. This "[slaved the department] into the frequency of the lightning", forcing them to "reverse-engineer the randomness". Because of the vast complications and expenses in presenting Hell to such an extent, future representations are restricted to "very tight angles".

Principal photography took place in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels for two nights to allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from inside one of the houses, the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside the house in the same scene made use of one of the basements.

The episode's synthesized orchestral score was written by <a href="Jay%20Gruska">Jay Gruska</a>, who especially enjoyed working on the episode due to his friendship with an actor from "It's a Good Life". The music, however, was not influenced by "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">The Twilight Zone</a>", as Gruska prefers to base his scores on an episode's visuals. The terrorizing scenes thus featured child sounds such as the high register of a toy piano, which used a "low approach underneath it" to make it "absolutely sinister".

In addition to the score, the episode followed the series tradition of a rock soundtrack. On their drive to New Harmony, Sam and Dean sing along to <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a>'s "<a href="Wanted%20Dead%20or%20Alive%20%28Bon%20Jovi%20song%29">Wanted Dead or Alive</a>". To mask Ackles' "very impressive singing voice", Kripke asked the actor to sing off-key.

On its initial broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.998 million viewers. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of "TV's <a href="Top%20100%20Episodes%20of%20All%20Time">Top 100 Episodes of All Time</a>". <a href="BuddyTV">BuddyTV</a>'s Don Williams deemed the finale "absolutely fantastic", and ranked it tenth on his list of the top "Supernatural" episodes of the first three seasons. Although he "respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [Dean's] deal"—the ending was a "complete jaw-dropper"—he pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected. Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing "Wanted Dead or Alive", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, "TV Guide"s Tina Charles described the episode as "creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale "<a href="Devil%27s%20Trap">Devil's Trap</a>". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki "totally stepped up to the plate and knocked one out of the park", and Ackles was "nine kinds of awesome". On the latter, Charles noted, "From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all." McCormick was described as "creepy", leading to Charles' "huge compliment" of comparing the episode to "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">The Twilight Zone</a>". For the critic, the "totally unexpected" Bon Jovi sing-along "totally rocked" and has "instantly become a classic". Her main disappointment with the episode, however, was the lack of Sam "going dark side". Maureen Ryan of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" listed the episode as one of the "gems" of the third season, and believed it likely to end up as one of her "Favorite 'Supernatural' Episodes of All Time". "<a href="The%20San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">The San Diego Union-Tribune</a>"s Karla Peterson agreed, giving the episode a grade of A-. Although it "got off to a shaky start with some weirdly paced scenes", it ended up a "finale that wrapped us in sticky threads of old fears, mind-bending new business and one awesome Bon Jovi song".

Brett Love of <a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>, on the other hand, "[stopped] short of calling [it] an excellent finale". While the deal's payoff was "fantastic"—he was surprised by Dean's death, and looked forward to its implications for the fourth season—Love was slightly disappointed with Lilith. McCormick "impressed" him as Lilith, but he did not find her as "menacing and scary" as <a href="Fredric%20Lehne">Fredric Lehne</a>'s <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a>. The villain's storyline of terrorizing a family would have made a "great regular episode", but was not epic enough for a finale. Diana Steenbergen of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> felt the scenes of Lilith's shore leave briefly "[dragged] the episode down" because the viewers "understood the situation quickly enough". She otherwise liked the episode, and gave it a score of 8.9 out of 10. Steenbergen enjoyed the "first-rate brotherly scenes", and was happy that the series followed through with its promise of sending Dean to Hell, commenting that the related hellhound attack was "one of the scariest things the show has done yet". Like Charles, she applauded the acting, noting that "we feel [Dean's] fear as the deadline approaches". She went on to write that Padalecki's "best moments are in the barely contained rage at his inability to save his brother, and in his grief at losing Dean", while "Lilith and her little girl mannerisms in Ruby's body were far more chilling, and interesting, than Ruby's tough chick persona ever has been".

A Journey

A Journey is a <a href="memoir">memoir</a> by <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> of his tenure as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>. Published in the UK on 1 September 2010, it covers events from when he <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29%20leadership%20election%2C%201994">became leader</a> of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> in 1994 and transformed it into "<a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a>", holding power for a party record <a href="Premiership%20of%20Tony%20Blair">three successive terms</a>, to his <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29%20leadership%20election%2C%202007">resignation and replacement</a> as Prime Minister by his <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>. Blair donated his £4.6 million <a href="Advance%20against%20royalties">advance</a>, and all subsequent <a href="royalties">royalties</a>, to the <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British Armed Forces</a> charity <a href="The%20Royal%20British%20Legion">The Royal British Legion</a>. It became the fastest-selling autobiography of all time at the bookstore chain <a href="Waterstones">Waterstones</a>. Promotional events were marked by anti-war protests.

Two of the book's major topics are the strains in Blair's relationship with Brown after Blair allegedly reneged on the pair's <a href="Blair%E2%80%93Brown%20deal">1994 agreement</a> to step down as Prime Minister much earlier, and his <a href="Opposition%20to%20the%20Iraq%20War">controversial decision</a> to participate in the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. Blair discusses Labour's future after the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 general election</a>, his relations with the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">Royal Family</a>, and how he came to respect President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Reviews were mixed; some criticised Blair's writing style, but others called it candid.

<a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> was reportedly unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of "<a href="London%20Review%20of%20Books">The London Review of Books</a>" suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled relationship with his Chancellor that were absent from "A Journey". Labour politician <a href="Alistair%20Darling">Alistair Darling</a> said the book demonstrates how the country can be changed for the better when a government has a clear purpose, while the "<a href="New%20Zealand%20Listener">New Zealand Listener</a>" suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write <a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a>'s epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of "A Journey", the screenwriter of the 2006 film "<a href="The%20Queen%20%282006%20film%29">The Queen</a>", which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> from him.

In March 2010, it was reported that Blair's memoirs, under the title "The Journey", would be published in September. <a href="Gail%20Rebuck">Gail Rebuck</a>, chairman and chief executive of <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a>, announced that the memoirs would be published by <a href="Hutchinson%20%28publisher%29">Hutchinson</a> in the United Kingdom. She predicted that the book would "break new ground in prime ministerial memoirs just as Blair himself broke the mould of British politics." Preliminary images of the book's cover, showing Blair in an open-neck shirt, were released. In July, the memoir was retitled as "A Journey"; one publishing expert speculated that it was changed to make Blair appear "less messianic". The publisher did not give any reason. It was announced the book would be published by <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Knopf">Knopf</a> in the United States and Canada under the title "A Journey: My Political Life"; and in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India by Random House. It was also released as an <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a>, read by Blair available for download and on 13 compact discs with a playing time of 16 hours. The book was published in the United Kingdom on 1 September.

Before the launch, Blair announced that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers. In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with me for the rest of my life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." <a href="BBC">BBC</a> political correspondent <a href="Norman%20Smith%20%28journalist%29">Norman Smith</a> said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as "guilt money" for taking the UK to <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">war against Iraq</a> in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a "guilty conscience." A spokesperson for the <a href="Stop%20the%20War%20Coalition">Stop the War Coalition</a> supported with the donation, but added, "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the <a href="Battle%20Back%20Challenge%20Centre">Battle Back Challenge Centre</a> was "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel."

"A Journey" covers Blair's time as leader of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> and then <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a> following his party's victory at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997 general election</a>. His tenure as Labour leader begins in 1994 following the death of his predecessor, <a href="John%20Smith%20%28Labour%20Party%20leader%29">John Smith</a>, an event Blair claims to have had a premonition about a month before Smith died. Blair believes he will succeed Smith as Labour leader rather than <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, who is a strong contender for the job. Blair and Brown subsequently reach an agreement whereby Brown will not run against Blair for the position, and will succeed him later. But it leads to a difficult working relationship, which is discussed at length. He likens them both to "a couple who loved each other, arguing over whose career should come first." To him, Brown is a "strange guy" with "zero" <a href="emotional%20intelligence">emotional intelligence</a>.

Having been elected as leader Blair moves the Labour Party to the <a href="Centrism">political centre ground</a>, repackaging it as "<a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a>", and goes on to win the 1997 general election. At his first meeting with <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> following his election as Prime Minister Blair recalls the Queen telling him, "You are my tenth prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born." Within a few months his government must deal with the aftermath of the <a href="death%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">death of Diana, Princess of Wales</a>, and following <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">the Princess</a>'s funeral, Elizabeth II tells Blair that lessons must be learned from the way things have been handled. Social occasions with the Queen are also recalled, including a gathering at <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a> where <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip</a> is described manning the barbecue while Elizabeth II dons a pair of <a href="rubber%20glove">rubber glove</a>s to wash up afterwards.

From the outset Blair's government plays a significant role in the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20peace%20process">Northern Ireland peace process</a>, during which Blair admits to using "a certain amount of creative ambiguity" to secure an agreement, claiming the process would not have succeeded otherwise. He says that he stretched the truth "on occasions past breaking point" in the run-up to the 2007 power-sharing deal which enabled the return of devolved legislative powers from <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Westminster</a> to the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Executive">Northern Ireland Executive</a>. Both <a href="Gerry%20Adams">Gerry Adams</a> and <a href="Martin%20McGuinness">Martin McGuinness</a> of <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a> are praised for the part they played in the peace process.

One of the themes that dominates the latter part of Blair's time in office is his decision to join US President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> in committing troops to the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, the aftermath of which he describes as a "nightmare", but that he believes to have been necessary because <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> "had not abandoned the strategy of <a href="Weapon%20of%20mass%20destruction">WMD</a> [weapons of mass destruction], merely made a tactical decision to put it into abeyance". He would make the same decision again with regard to Iran, warning that if that country develops nuclear weapons it will change the balance of power of the Middle East, to the region's detriment. Blair believes some problems in Iraq still require a "resolution" and will fester if left unattended. Of the war dead he says, "I feel desperately sorry for them, sorry for the lives cut short, sorry for the families whose bereavement is made worse by the controversy over why their loved ones died, sorry for the utterly unfair selection that the loss should be theirs." A year on from the invasion he hopes Bush will <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">win a second term as US President</a>: "I had come to like and admire George," he writes.

In 2003, Blair promises his Chancellor, <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> that he will resign before the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202005">next general election</a>, but later changes his mind. Brown subsequently attempts to blackmail him, threatened to call for a Labour Party inquiry into the 2005 <a href="Cash%20for%20Honours">Cash for Honours</a> affair during an argument over pension policy. Brown succeeds Blair as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister in 2007. But while Blair praises Brown as a good Chancellor and a committed public servant, he believes his decision to abandon the <a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a> policies of the Blair years leads to the party's <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 election defeat</a>. However, Brown is right to restructure British banks and introduce an economic stimulus after the <a href="Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis</a>.

The book closes with a final chapter offering a critique of Labour Party policy, and discusses its future. Blair warns Brown's successor that if Labour is to remain electable they should continue with the policies of <a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a> and not return to the left-wing policies of the 1980s: "I won three elections. Up to then, Labour had never even won two successive full terms. The longest Labour government had lasted six years. This lasted 13. It could have gone on longer, had it not abandoned <a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a>."

Within hours of its launch "A Journey" became the fastest-selling autobiography of all time at bookseller <a href="Waterstones">Waterstones</a>, where it sold more copies in one day than <a href="Peter%20Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a>'s "" had done in its first three weeks earlier that year. It debuted at the top of <a href="Amazon.co.uk">Amazon.co.uk</a>'s British best-seller list. Within a week, <a href="Nielsen%20BookScan">Nielsen BookScan</a> said that 92,000 copies of "A Journey" had been sold in the United Kingdom, the best opening week for an autobiography since the company began keeping figures in 1998. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that in the United States, an initial print run of 50,000 copies had been extended by another 25,000, with the book set to debut at Number 3 on <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"The New York Times" hardcover best-seller list</a>. Andrew Lake, Waterstones' political buyer, said, "Nothing can compare to the level of interest shown in this book. You have to look at hugely successful fiction authors such as <a href="Dan%20Brown">Dan Brown</a> or <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">JK Rowling</a> to find books that have sold more quickly on their first day. Mandelson may remain the prince but Blair has reclaimed his title as king, certainly in terms of book sales.
Blair recorded a series of promotional interviews for radio and television for, among others, the Arabic television network <a href="Al%20Jazeera%20English">Al Jazeera</a>, the <a href="ITV1">ITV1</a> daytime magazine programme "<a href="This%20Morning%20%28TV%20programme%29">This Morning</a>", and <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>, which aired an hour-long interview with the journalist and political commentator <a href="Andrew%20Marr">Andrew Marr</a>. He was in Washington, D.C. on the day of the UK launch to participate in peace talks with Middle East leaders and attend a <a href="White%20House">White House</a> dinner with <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, and Israeli and <a href="State%20of%20Palestine">Palestinian</a> leaders. The British newspaper "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" reported that Blair's visit to the United States was a coincidence, and not an attempt to be out of the United Kingdom when the book was published. When Blair arrived for his first book signing at a leading bookshop on <a href="O%27Connell%20Street">O'Connell Street</a>, Dublin on 4 September, demonstrators heckled, jeered and threw eggs and shoes at him. One activist posed as a purchaser to attempt a <a href="citizen%27s%20arrest">citizen's arrest</a> of Blair for war crimes. Protestors clashed with <a href="Garda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na">Irish police</a> and tried to push over a security barrier outside the shop. The demonstrators—anti-war protestors and <a href="Irish%20republicanism">Irish republicans</a> opposed to the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20peace%20process">peace process</a>—called queuing customers "traitors" and "<a href="West%20Brit">West Brit</a>s". Four people were arrested during the incident.

Several days after the launch of the book, Blair appeared on the <a href="series%20premiere">series premiere</a> of ITV1's breakfast television programme "<a href="Daybreak%20%282010%20TV%20series%29">Daybreak</a>", where he criticised the Dublin protestors as a small minority given undue media attention. Since the book was selling well, and given fears that protesters would also be present at a forthcoming book signing in London on 8 September, he expressed doubts over whether that event was justifiable or worth the inevitable disruption. Later in the day it was confirmed the signing at Waterstones in <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a> would not go ahead. A spokesman for Blair announced that a planned launch party for the book scheduled for the <a href="Tate%20Modern">Tate Modern</a> would take place despite plans by the <a href="Stop%20the%20War%20Coalition">Stop the War Coalition</a> to demonstrate. However, the following day this event was also cancelled as a result of threats of disruption by campaigners. In subsequent weeks, a number of media organisations reported that copies of "A Journey" were being moved from autobiographical sections in bookshops to sections on crime and horror. More than 10,000 people had joined a Facebook page calling for that action.

"A Journey" drew a mixed reception from critics. "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" editor <a href="Lionel%20Barber">Lionel Barber</a> called it "part psychodrama, part treatise on the frustrations of leadership in a modern democracy ... written in a chummy style with touches of <a href="Mills%20%26amp%3B%20Boon">Mills & Boon</a>". He wrote that it made Blair seem "likable, if manipulative; capable of dissembling while wonderfully fluent; in short, a brilliant modern politician (whatever his moans about the media)." Writing in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent on Sunday</a>", Geoffrey Beattie said "A Journey" offered an understanding of Blair's "underlying psychology." <a href="John%20Rentoul">John Rentoul</a>, author of the Blair biography "Tony Blair Prime Minister", was equally positive, giving particular praise to the chapter on the Iraq War. "The chapter on Iraq is tightly argued in some detail, which may persuade those with open minds to recognise that the decision to join the US invasion was a reasonable, if not very successful, one, rather than a conspiracy against life, the universe and everything decent," he said. <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Sieghart">Mary Ann Sieghart</a>, writing for "The Independent" said, "whatever its faults, and toe-curling passages, ["A Journey"] has many good lessons on how to succeed in both opposition and government.

Other reviewers were less positive. The political journalist and author <a href="Andrew%20Rawnsley">Andrew Rawnsley</a> was critical of Blair's writing style in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>". "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," he wrote. "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but he can be a ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." Julian Glover, a columnist in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", said that "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a>" was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. "If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." In the journal "<a href="History%20Today">History Today</a>", <a href="Archie%20Brown">Archie Brown</a>, Emeritus Professor of Politics at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric."

Reviews in the US sounded similar themes. In "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", British novelist <a href="John%20Lanchester">John Lanchester</a> called "A Journey" "a detailed account of scrambling, scraping, horse-trading, bluffing, and fudging the way to a deal—a remarkable combination of the ramshackle and the historic." <a href="Fareed%20Zakaria">Fareed Zakaria</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review">The New York Times Book Review</a>" praised Blair for his openness in the publication. "When speaking about the challenges of his first term in office, Blair writes honestly and openly," the newspaper said. "The style is not the elegant Oxbridge prose that might have been expected of a former prime minister but one filled with Americanisms. It is breezy, informal and candid enough to keep the reader thoroughly engaged." However, Zakaria attacked Blair's "sweeping generalizations" about terrorism.

Writing in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", <a href="Leonard%20Downie%2C%20Jr.">Leonard Downie, Jr.</a>, former editor of that paper, called the work a "notably wistful memoir" and is generally positive about its content: "Toward the end of this well-written and perhaps unintentionally self-revealing memoir, Tony Blair, who was Britain's prime minister during an eventful decade from 1997 to 2007, insists he is 'trying valiantly not to fall into self-justifying mode—a bane of political memoirs.' But he has done just that." Tim Rutton of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" also gave the memoirs a favourable review, declaring it "a political biography of unusual interest."

There are fewer reviews from newspapers outside the United Kingdom and United States, but those available are generally positive. Writing for Australia's "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" <a href="Alexander%20Downer">Alexander Downer</a>, who served as Foreign Minister in the <a href="Howard%20Government">Government of John Howard</a> gave "A Journey" a favourable review: "His [Blair's] commitment to humanity is sincere and convincing, and his personality infectiously amiable with a delightful sense of self-deprecating humour." Konrad Yakabuski, a senior political writer for Canada's "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" was also positive: "If Tony Blair has not continued to agonize over the tough decisions of his prime ministership, he does a pretty good job of persuading otherwise in A Journey." India's English language daily "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" said of the book, "It is by no means a confessional memoir but a brave attempt with only patchy success at self-justification."

The Queen reportedly felt a "profound sense of disappointment" in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing in his memoirs sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister. A spokesman for <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> told a newspaper, "No prime minister before has ever done this and we can only hope that it will never happen again." The "<a href="Sunday%20Express">Sunday Express</a>" claimed, quoting "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" and other "Royal insiders", that because of the book's contents, Elizabeth II would withhold granting Blair the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Thistle">Order of the Thistle</a>, an <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">honour</a> which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> was said to be "seething" and "dismayed" over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. <a href="Ed%20Balls">Ed Balls</a>, a Brown ally who served in <a href="Brown%20ministry">his government</a> as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that sense I thought it was all a bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely."

Several more of Blair's former colleagues and political opponents also commented on the book. Former <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> minister <a href="Norman%20Tebbit">Norman Tebbit</a> wrote in "The Daily Telegraph", ""A Journey" seems to be dominated by Blair's anxiety to be seen as a great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in "The Guardian", <a href="Alistair%20Darling">Alistair Darling</a>, who was Chancellor under <a href="Premiership%20of%20Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, said that he "read with wry amusement how <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself." He concluded that the book was "a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a clear sense of purpose: we can win and change the country for the better." Labour Member of Parliament <a href="Tom%20Harris%20%28British%20politician%29">Tom Harris</a> said that the book "will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great things can be accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core." Of Blair, he said, "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for an awful lot longer than he was unpopular." <a href="Ed%20Miliband">Ed Miliband</a>, then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, "I think it is time to move on from <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> and <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> and <a href="Peter%20Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a> and to move on from the <a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a> establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page." He was <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29%20leadership%20election%2C%202010">elected</a> as Leader of the Labour Party several weeks later.

Some families of servicemen and servicewomen who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. "I can't regret the decision to go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic nightmare that unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," he says in the book. <a href="Reg%20Keys">Reg Keys</a>, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was "just <a href="crocodile%20tears">crocodile tears</a> from Blair." Keys said, "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." A spokesperson for <a href="Military%20Families%20Against%20the%20War">Military Families Against the War</a> said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was "completely meaningless." The spokesperson added, "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable."

Some of the dialogue Blair uses to describe his first meeting with Elizabeth II led to accusations of plagiarism from <a href="Peter%20Morgan">Peter Morgan</a>, who wrote "<a href="The%20Queen%20%282006%20film%29">The Queen</a>", set during the first few months of Blair's premiership. Blair recalls his first meeting with Elizabeth II in which she tells him, "You are my 10th prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born." In the film, <a href="Helen%20Mirren">Helen Mirren</a>'s fictionalised Elizabeth II says almost exactly the same thing. Morgan said it had been purely his own imagination.

Some commentators offered comparisons between "A Journey" and accounts of the Blair years written by other senior members of his government, particularly on Blair's relationship with Gordon Brown. David Goodhart of "<a href="Prospect%20Magazine">Prospect Magazine</a>" wrote that in both Peter Mandelson's memoir "The Third Man" and the first volume of <a href="Alastair%20Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>'s Diaries (1994–97), "Blair is important, but a rather weak figure buffeted by events and by Gordon Brown. In Blair's own account, A Journey (in which Mandelson features hardly at all, and Gordon Brown only at the end) it is of course very different. Almost everything is driven forward by him; the new Labour project was not imminent in Britain's political history—it had to be shaped and moulded." A similar theme was echoed by David Runciman in "The London Review of Books", where he reflected that Mandelson's memoirs "provide a much more complete account of the Blair/Brown relationship", including details of "Operation Teddy Bear", an aborted plot from 2003 to curb Brown's increasing influence as Chancellor by dividing the Treasury to create a separate Office of Budget and Delivery that would be controlled directly by the <a href="Cabinet%20Office">Cabinet Office</a>.

Writing for the journal "British Politics", academic Mark Garnett provided a detailed analysis of the Blair and Mandelson memoirs, observing that while "A Journey" gives a more in-depth account of what he termed "contemporary British government", "The Third Man" is a more satisfying read: ""The Third Man" was a worthwhile effort for Peter Mandelson's reputation, while Tony Blair has journeyed in vain." The "New Zealand Listener", on the other hand, suggested that "A Journey" and other memoirs written by prominent architects of New Labour had helped to seal its doom after <a href="David%20Miliband">David Miliband</a> – the preferred candidate of all three as Brown's successor – failed to be elected to the position: "All three backed David Miliband, and however much Miliband tried to distance himself – I'm not New Labour, I'm Next Labour – these three books and the publicity that surrounded them showed he had New Labour dye all over his hands. David was beaten to the leadership by his younger brother, Ed (a man who lacked, as Blair himself might put it, the New Labour baggage), by a whisker – just over 1%. And at a stroke, it's clear these great, vocal proselytisers of New Labour have unwittingly written its epitaph."

Pig-faced women

<a href="Legend">Legend</a>s featuring pig-faced women originated roughly simultaneously in <a href="Holland">Holland</a>, <a href="England">England</a> and <a href="France">France</a> in the late 1630s. The stories told of a wealthy woman whose body was of normal human appearance, but whose face was that of a pig.

In the earliest forms of the story, the woman's pig-like appearance was the result of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that the choice was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>.

The magical elements gradually vanished from the story, and the existence of pig-faced women began to be treated as fact. The story became particularly widespread in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> in the early 19th century, where it became widely believed that reclusive 18th-century philanthropist <a href="Griselda%20Steevens">Griselda Steevens</a> had kept herself hidden from view because she had the face of a pig. In late 1814 and early 1815, rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman was living in <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>. Her existence was widely reported as fact, and numerous alleged portraits of her were published. With belief in pig-faced women commonplace, unscrupulous showmen exhibited living "pig-faced women" at fairs. These were not genuine women, but shaven bears dressed in women's clothing.

Belief in pig-faced women declined, and the last significant work to treat their existence as genuine was published in 1924. Today, the legend is almost forgotten.

While stories of pig-faced women vary in detail, they have the same basic form. A pregnant noblewoman would be approached by a beggar accompanied by her children, and would dismiss the beggar, and in so doing would in some way compare the beggar's children to pigs. The beggar would curse the pregnant noblewoman, and come the birth of the child it would be a girl, healthy and perfectly formed in every respect other than having the face of a pig.

The child would grow up healthy, but with some of the behaviours of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.

Although originating roughly simultaneously in Holland, England, and France, it was only in England, and later in Ireland, that the legend became well known and widely believed. In 1861 <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> remarked on the longevity of the belief in pig-faced women in England, commenting that "In every age, I suppose, there has been a pig-faced lady".

While earlier stories of humans with the appearance of animals are common, prior to the 17th century there are no recorded European stories of humans with the faces of pigs. (An 1829 paper in the "<a href="Quarterly%20Journal%20of%20Science%2C%20Literature%2C%20and%20the%20Arts">Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and the Arts</a>" claims that the legend was circulating in Paris in 1595 but offers no detail or corroborating evidence.) The earliest versions of the story of the pig-faced woman appear to have originated roughly simultaneously in England, Holland and France, and to have become prevalent in England in late 1639. A 1904 paper in "Volkskunde" magazine by Dutch historian and antiquarian traces the earliest forms of the legend as appearing in 1638 or 1639.

The earliest surviving version of the legend is a Dutch <a href="old%20master%20print">print</a> about an Amsterdam woman named Jacamijntjen Jacobs. In 1621 Jacobs, while pregnant, was approached one day by a female beggar accompanied by three children, who pleaded that her children were starving. Jacobs told the beggar "Take away your filthy pigs, I will not give you anything". The woman replied "Are these my children pigs? May God then give you such pigs as I have here!" Jacobs' daughter was born with the head and face of a pig, and at the time of publication in 1638–39 the daughter, by then in her teens, supposedly ate from a trough and spoke in a grunting voice.

<a href="Jan%20Bondeson">Bondeson</a> (2006) speculates that the pig-faced woman myth originated as a fusion of two earlier stories. The mediaeval Dutch legend of <a href="Margaret%20of%20Holland%2C%20Countess%20of%20Henneberg">Margaret of Henneberg</a> tells of a wealthy noblewoman who turned away a beggar with twins, and was herself punished by giving birth to 365 children. In a similar French folk tale, the noblewoman in question described the beggar's children as "piglets", and gave birth to a litter of nine piglets.

The other significant theory about the origin of the legend, proposed by <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28publisher%20born%201802%29">Robert Chambers</a> in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of <a href="teratology">teratology</a> (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of <a href="maternal%20impression">maternal impression</a> (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to <a href="Julia%20Pastrana">Julia Pastrana</a>, a woman with <a href="hypertrichosis">hypertrichosis</a> and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 <a href="stillbirth">stillbirth</a> with a face resembling a pig is documented, there has never been a reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.

The first recorded reference in England to the legend of the pig-faced woman is the fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century variation on the traditional <a href="loathly%20lady">loathly lady</a> story, in particular on "<a href="The%20Wife%20of%20Bath%27s%20Tale">The Wife of Bath's Tale</a>" and "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Sir%20Gawain">The Marriage of Sir Gawain</a>". The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women. Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London, all of which are now lost. (A 1640 ballad, "A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, a Description of a female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a head like a swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now to be seen in London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate", is preserved in <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>'s extensive collection of ballads.) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in "A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker", a 1640 <a href="chapbook">chapbook</a>.

"A Certaine Relation" claims that Tannakin Skinker was born to Joachim and Parnel Skinker in 1618 in "Wirkham, a neuter towne betweene the Emperour and the Hollander, scituate on the river Rhyne". Joachim Skinker is described as "a man of good revenue, but of a great estate in money and cattle." During Parnel's pregnancy, an elderly woman had begged her for money. Parnel was busy and refused to pay, and the old woman had left, "muttering to her selfe the Divells pater noster, and was heard to say 'As the Mother is Hoggish, so Swinish shall be the Child shee goeth withall. At Tannakin's birth her body and limbs were correctly proportioned, but her face had a pig's snout, "not only a stain and blemish, but a deformed uglinesse, making all the rest loathsome, contemptible and odious to all that lookt upon her in her infancie." The midwife who had delivered the baby was sworn to secrecy, and the Skinkers raised her in a private room. She ate from a silver trough, "to which she stooped and ate, just like a Swine doth in his swilling tub".

Tannakin's deformity was soon discovered, and many locals came to hear her pig-like speech or to watch her feed from the trough. The old woman was located, tried and convicted for witchcraft, but even at the stake refused or was unable to reverse the enchantment.

When Tannakin was between 16 and 17 years old, her father consulted Vandermast, "a famous Artist, who was both a Mathematician, and an Astrologian [...] a man who was suspected to have been well versed in blacke and hidden Arts", as to how the curse might be undone. Vandermast concluded that as long as Tannakin remained a virgin she would retain her pig's face, but were she married, and not to "a Clowne, Bore or Pesant", she might be cured.
The Skinker family announced that any gentleman who "would take her to his bed after loyall Matrimony" would receive a dowry of £40,000. The dowry, a huge sum for the time, prompted a large number of would-be husbands. A Scottish captain arrived, having spent the greater part of a month's pay on a new suit, and was taken by Tannakin's figure and deportment. On lifting the veil to view her face, however, "hee would stay no other conference, but ran away without further answer, saying; they must pardon him, for hee could indure no Porke." An English sow-man (pig farmer) assured the family that his familiarity with pigs meant he would accept Tannakin's appearance, but after meeting her he left the building, saying that "so long as I have known Rumford, I never saw such a Hogsnout".

Several further would-be suitors visited the Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she remained unmarried. Despairing of finding a suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either <a href="Blackfriars%2C%20London">Blackfriars</a> or <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>. (The anonymous author of "A Certaine Relation" says that the family did not wish to divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her elegant dress and excellent demeanour.

Eventually, the Skinkers found a man in London willing to marry Tannakin. On the day of the wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed together for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He turned to look at her, and saw "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying:
Torn between the choice of a wife who would appear beautiful to him but hideous to all his friends, or hideous to him but beautiful to all his friends, he could not reach a decision but instead said to her "into you owne hands and choyse I give the full power and soveraignty to make election of which you best please." On hearing this, Tannakin turned to him and said:

The fable of Tannakin Skinker was popular in England, and the idea of the pig-faced woman soon entered popular culture, to the extent that by 1654, it was recorded that one of the signs at <a href="Bartholomew%20Fair">Bartholomew Fair</a> was "the Signe of the Hoggs-fac'd Gentlewoman". By the 1670s, was a popular song, relating in detail how a tailor and a miller courted a woman whose "visage was perfectly just like a Sow" in the hope of securing her dowry (given as £17,000, not the £40,000 of "A Certaine Relation"). On seeing her face each turned and fled. "The Long-Nos'd Lass" does not contain the magical elements of "A Certaine Relation", nor end in the wedding and the transformation of the pig-faced woman, the traditional ending of stories in the genre. Instead, the pig-faced woman remains unmarried, and the ballad ends:

In the 18th century, stories of pig-faced women began to be reported as fact in England. <a href="James%20Paris%20du%20Plessis">James Paris du Plessis</a>, former servant to Samuel Pepys, told in his "Short History of Human Prodigious & Monstrous Births" (compiled 1731–33) of a pig-faced woman living in <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> in central London, which was widely reprinted. An 1850 article in "<a href="Chambers%27s%20Edinburgh%20Journal">Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</a>" carried the recollections of "a venerable and clear-headed old lady of ninety", in which she recounted that her mother was well acquainted with a pig-faced woman, of Scottish birth but living in London, and would regularly visit her home in <a href="Sloane%20Street">Sloane Street</a>. In 1800, "The Pig-faced Lady", as "sung at <a href="Astley%27s%20Amphitheatre">Astley's Theatre</a>, &c.", was published in London by John Pitts, and an 1815 editorial in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" recounted reports of a pig-faced woman living in London as having circulated in 1764 and in the 1780s.

A variant form of the legend, and the only one in which the pig-faced woman is not connected with a great fortune, told of a Christian man who converted to Judaism. In this version, the first child born to him after his conversion was a girl with the face of a pig. Some years later, the father realised that his daughter's appearance was a divine punishment, and re-converted to Christianity along with his pig-faced daughter. At the moment of the daughter's baptism, the holy water washed her pig-like features away, revealing a normal human face. The story was alleged to be represented by a sculpture in "one of the grand old cathedrals of Belgium", but no evidence for such a sculpture has been found.

<a href="Griselda%20Steevens">Griselda Steevens</a> (1653 – 18 March 1746), sometimes written as "Grizel Steevens", was the twin sister of Dr Richard Steevens (1653–1710), a Dublin physician. Dr Steevens died in 1710, bequeathing an estate with an income of £606 (about £ as of 2019) per year to Griselda. A clause in Dr Steevens' will stipulated that on Griselda's death, the income was to be used to provide a hospital for the poor of Dublin.
Although the terms of Dr Steevens' will were that work on the hospital would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720. Reserving only £120 per year for her own use, she used the remaining funds to buy a plot of land near <a href="Kilmainham">Kilmainham</a> and to build the new hospital, with the sole condition being that she be granted a suite of apartments in the building. As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out <a href="alms">alms</a> to the poor. By 1723 a sufficient portion of the new <a href="Dr%20Steevens%27%20Hospital">Dr Steevens' Hospital</a> was completed to accommodate 40 patients, in addition to Griselda's apartments. The remainder of the hospital, with space for 200 patients, opened in 1733. Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.

At some point, it became a common belief in Dublin that Griselda Steevens had a pig's face. It is unclear when the rumour arose. Robert Chambers and <a href="Irish%20Georgian%20Society">Irish Georgian Society</a> founder <a href="Desmond%20Guinness">Desmond Guinness</a> claim that the rumour was current in her lifetime, but Thomas Kirkpatrick, author of "History of Dr Steevens' Hospital Dublin", says that "There is absolutely no evidence of this story in contemporary records, nor indeed does it appear to have been connected with the good lady until the nineteenth century [...] It is not quite certain when this story first gained circulation. Croker-King, who wrote a history of the hospital in 1785, makes no mention of it, nor is there any suggestion of it in the newspaper accounts of the death of Madam Steevens, or the published account of the hospital in the eighteenth century."

The rumour was that Griselda Steevens' reclusiveness and always being veiled were owing to her having been born with a pig's head. Chambers (1864) speculates that her unusual name may have contributed to the legend, and notes the common belief that she was named "Grisly" on account of her appearance when born. It was claimed that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' mother had said "take away your litter of pigs!" to a woman beggar asking for money to feed her children, and Griselda had then been born with the head and face of a pig. Dismayed by the popular belief that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open balcony to allow the public to see her face. This failed to stem the spread of the rumour, and she commissioned a portrait of herself to be hung in the main hall of the hospital. The portrait failed to have the desired effect; many of the public chose instead to believe a portrait in a pub neighbouring the hospital, which showed Steevens with a pig's head; the pub also displayed a silver trough alleged to have belonged to her. She eventually withdrew from public view completely before her death on 18 March 1746.

Surgeon and historian <a href="William%20Wilde">William Wilde</a> recollected that as a medical student at Dr Steevens' Hospital in 1832 he was shown a silver trough, alleged to have belonged to Griselda Steevens, and accounts suggest that in the early 19th century a plaster cast of a human face with a pig's snout was on display at the hospital. Although the hospital authorities later forbade the display of alleged Steevens memorabilia on pain of dismissal, in the later half of the 19th century the belief that Steevens had a pig's face remained common. In the 1860s, a Dublin woman recollected that in her youth a large silver punchbowl, embossed with a family crest of a boar's head, was shown to visitors and was claimed to have been the Pig-faced Lady's trough.

In late 1814 and early 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman was living in <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>, an inner-city area of central London. Said to be the daughter of an unspecified noblewoman, she was supposedly young, wealthy and living in fashionable <a href="Manchester%20Square">Manchester Square</a>. In some reports she was described as the daughter of a noblewoman from <a href="Grosvenor%20Square">Grosvenor Square</a>. It was claimed that she would occasionally venture out of the house in a carriage, hidden by a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a window, or a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.
In early 1815 the first of many portraits of the Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square was published. This included a brief biography, allegedly from "a female who attended on her". It claimed that the Pig-faced Lady was Irish and aged about 20, from a wealthy family, and that "on her life and issue by marriage a very large property depends". She was alleged to eat from a silver trough, and to speak only in grunts. It claimed that her attendant, although paid an annual salary of 1,000 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (about £ as of 2019), had been too frightened to continue working for her and had resigned, giving her story to the press.

The Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square became a leading topic of conversation in London. She soon began to be reported in newspapers as fact, and thousands of people believed in her existence. On 9 February 1815 an advertisement appeared in the "Times" from a self-described "young Gentlewoman", offering to be the Pig-faced Lady's companion in return for "a handsome income yearly, and a premium for residing with her 7 years". The advertisement was published, but a week later a prospective advertisement from a young man wishing to propose marriage to the Pig-faced Lady prompted the "Times" to denounce the rumour, comparing believers in the Pig-faced Lady to the followers of the (recently deceased) self-proclaimed prophet <a href="Joanna%20Southcott">Joanna Southcott</a>.

The "Times" refused to print the advertisement from the Pig-faced Lady's would-be suitor, and donated his £1 fee to <a href="The%20Marine%20Society">The Marine Society</a>. An anonymous letter-writer to the "Times" continued the comparison with Joanna Southcott, who had claimed that she would give birth to the <a href="Messiah">Messiah</a> in October 1814, speculating that "the present miss piggy" was perhaps Southcott's child, "brought [...] into the world in a state of complete puberty". The letter-writer also ridiculed the "swinish Lothario" who hoped to marry the Pig-faced Lady, suggesting that "if he means to have her, he must woo her in grunts".

With the "Times" ridiculing belief in the Pig-faced Lady, rival newspapers set out to defend her honour and that of the man who wished to marry her. The "<a href="Morning%20Herald">Morning Herald</a>" and "<a href="Morning%20Chronicle">Morning Chronicle</a>" both published the advertisement from her prospective suitor. The editor of the "Morning Chronicle" announced that, in his opinion, the advertisement from the "desperate fortune-hunter" had not been immoral or indecent, and thus in his opinion there was no reason to decline to publish it. He went on to say that while deformities of this nature were unknown to doctors, it was certainly possible that a facially disfigured woman existed and that her deformities had been exaggerated in accounts; he also chided the "Times" for not returning the payment for the rejected advertisement. The "Morning Herald", meanwhile, speculated that the Pig-faced Lady's deformities may have been caused by her mother's "force of imagination, in consequence of a dog having suddenly leaped on her".

Despite the pleas of the "Times" for scepticism, belief in the Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square continued to spread in 1815. During illuminations celebrating the end of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> a huge crowd gathered around <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, bringing traffic to a standstill. Eyewitnesses recounted that in a stopped <a href="Landau%20%28carriage%29">landau</a> a woman with a fashionable bonnet and a pig's snout was visible. The crowd tried to stop the carriage, but the coachman drove through the crowd at high speed. It was later claimed that the coach had been seen to stop in Grosvenor Square; it was presumed that the Pig-faced Lady was the daughter of "a well-known lady of fashion" who lived there.
It was also reported that William Elliot, a young <a href="baronet">baronet</a>, called to visit a "great lady" at the house in Grosvenor Square in which the Pig-faced Lady was believed to be staying. Taken into the <a href="drawing%20room">drawing room</a>, he was confronted by a fashionably dressed woman with the face of a pig. Elliot "could not refrain from uttering a shout of horror, and rushed to the door in a manner the reverse of polite". The Pig-faced Lady rushed at Elliot as he left and bit him on the back of the neck; it was claimed that he was badly injured in the attack, requiring treatment by eminent surgeon <a href="Sir%20C%C3%A6sar%20Hawkins%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Cæsar Hawkins</a>. A popular print entitled "Beware the pig-sty!" depicted the supposed attack on Elliot.

In April 1861, a man signing himself "M. A." wrote to "<a href="Notes%20and%20Queries">Notes and Queries</a>" magazine, asking: 

In a reply published on 22 June 1861, a Mr F. FitzHenry claimed to have known the Pig-faced Lady's sister, stating that "Lady C. B. lived in Chelsea: her sister, Lady H. W., was much admired as a beauty. I was at a dinner-party forty years ago with Lady H. W., when all the party were cautioned previously not to say a word about "pigs", out of delicacy to Lady H. W." In the same issue, a George Lloyd claimed to have seen the Pig-faced Lady in <a href="Wakefield">Wakefield</a> in around 1828–29 "but was too young to take a note further than a mental one, which has haunted me ever since".

On 21 March 1815 "The Pig Faced Lady of Manchester Square and the Spanish Mule of Madrid", a coloured print by <a href="George%20Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>, was published. Captioned "Ah! Sure a pair was never seen so justly form'd to meet by nature!", it contrasts the Pig-faced Lady with the unpopular <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">Ferdinand VII of Spain</a>. The Pig-faced Lady wears a transparent veil and plays "Air Swinish Multitude, set to music by Grunt Esq" on a piano. Her silver trough lies on a table behind her, and on her wall is a picture of "Lord Bacon", also shown with a pig's head. Her image is captioned: Facing her in another panel is Ferdinand VII, shown with a mule's head. Ferdinand sits on a wooden throne, with a <a href="chamber%20pot">chamber pot</a> filled with holy water at his feet. On the wall behind him, a painting shows Ferdinand (again with a mule's head) watching a mass execution; a monk says "Here's some more patriots", and Ferdinand replies "O! That's right kill 'em kill 'em". The caption to Ferdinand's image reads:

Cruikshank returned to the theme of the Pig-faced Lady with "Suitors to the Pig-faced Lady", published shortly after "The Pig Faced Lady and the Spanish Mule". This shows a number of men wooing the lady, who rejects them all in term with "If you think to "gammon" me, you'll find you've got the wrong "sow" by the ear – I'm "meat" for your "masters", so go along, I'll not be plagued by any of you".
At the height of the Pig-faced Lady mania of 1814–15, it was rumoured that <a href="Sholto%20Henry%20Maclellan%2C%209th%20Lord%20Kirkcudbright">Sholto Henry Maclellan, 9th Lord Kirkcudbright</a> had made enquiries about the whereabouts of the Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square, possibly with a view to becoming one of her suitors. "Waltzing a Courtship", an anonymous drawing, was widely circulated in various publications. It shows an elegantly dressed Pig-faced Lady dancing with a <a href="Kyphosis">hunchbacked</a> and extremely short man bearing a strong resemblance to Kirkcudbright.

Another popular print, "The Wonderful Mrs Atkinson", was published anonymously in around 1815, based on an earlier drawing by <a href="George%20Morland">George Morland</a>. (Morland had died in 1804, so his drawing cannot have been inspired by the 1814–15 reports.) Morland's original drawing stated that the Pig-faced Lady was "born in Ireland, has £20,000 fortune, and is fed out of a silver trough". The caption to the later, published print goes into more detail, claiming that: 

Shortly after the London pig-faced lady craze of 1814–15, a similar story began to circulate in Paris. In this version, the woman was "gifted with every accomplishment in the most degree", and was seeking a man who would love her for her talents despite her appearance. Unlike the pig-faced woman reports in London, the woman's address was given. Large crowds gathered in the street outside, and a large number of letters were delivered to the address.

She was eventually revealed as a hoax. A young man, his advances rebuffed by a woman, had started the story as a means of revenge. It was reported that the stream of visitors wishing to meet the Pig-faced Lady became so annoying, the young woman in question was forced to move house.

In the wake of the Pig-faced Lady scare of 1814–15, exhibits on the subject of pig-faced women became popular at fairs. William Wilde records that a print of "The Wonderful Mrs Atkinson" was a popular exhibit at an early 19th century Irish fair, while larger fairs included exhibits of pig-faced women moulded in <a href="papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9">papier-mâché</a> or wax. There is some evidence that a living pig-faced woman was exhibited at Bartholomew Fair in 1828, and possibly also in previous years. (The pig-faced woman exhibited in Wakefield in 1828–29, recalled by George Lloyd in 1861, may have been the same one shown at Bartholomew Fair in 1828.) At an 1843 fair in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>, "Madam Steevens, the Wonderful Pig-faced Lady" was exhibited, and would grunt to give replies to questions from the audience.
The pig-faced women exhibited at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it large amounts of strong beer, and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would be attached to the bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.

Once the bear was dressed and in the chair, the audience would be allowed into the tent. The showman would tell the audience that the Pig-faced Lady could not speak, but would answer questions put to her, with one grunt for "yes" and two for "no". The audience would ask her questions, and a member of the crew would poke the bear with a stick to make it grunt in reply. The Pig-faced Lady would then eat a meal of <a href="gruel">gruel</a>, beer and apples, served in a silver trough. The display of "pig-faced ladies" became extremely popular, to the extent that by 1861 Charles Dickens remarked that "no fair was complete without one". Exhibitions of this type were particularly popular in Dublin; an exhibition in Plymouth in the 1880s was less successful, and a disbelieving mob pulled the wig and hat from a "Pig-faced Lady" in her tent and proceeded to attack the showmen. The fate of the bear is not recorded.

The legend of the pig-faced woman was revived once more in 1865, in <a href="Sheridan%20Le%20Fanu">Sheridan Le Fanu</a>'s novel "<a href="Uncle%20Silas">Uncle Silas</a>". "Uncle Silas" tells the story of Maud Ruthyn, a wealthy heiress in her late teens who lives in a secluded house, whom a number of scheming men aim to marry to secure her money. The book includes a "<a href="Barzaz%20Breiz">Bretagne ballad</a>" about the pig-faced woman, sung to Maud by her scheming governess Madame de la Rougierre as Rougierre leads her to a secret meeting with her cousin Dudley, who also has designs on her fortune. (No other record of the "Bretagne ballad" exists, and it was almost certainly written by Le Fanu himself.)
While Maud is described in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, "Uncle Silas" is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's situation and the legend of the wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money. Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the "<a href="Dublin%20University%20Magazine">Dublin University Magazine</a>", and would certainly have been familiar with the legends of the pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.

The 1814–15 Pig-faced Lady craze in London and the subsequent hoax in Paris were the last occasions in which the mainstream press reported the existence of pig-faced women as fact. By the 1860s the fad for exhibiting "pig-faced women" at fairs was losing popularity, although they continued to be exhibited until at least the 1880s. Today the legend is almost forgotten.

While Dr Steevens' Hospital still exists, albeit now as the head office of the <a href="Health%20Service%20Executive">Health Service Executive</a> () rather than as a working hospital, the display of Pig-faced Lady memorabilia at the hospital had ceased by the mid-19th century. The portrait commissioned by Griselda Steevens to refute the rumours about her appearance still hangs in the hospital's main hall.

The last significant work to treat the existence of pig-faced women as fact was "Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful" by <a href="Ghost%20hunting">ghost hunter</a> and supernatural researcher <a href="Elliott%20O%27Donnell">Elliott O'Donnell</a>, published in 1924. O'Donnell alleged that the ghost of a pig-faced lady haunted a house in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>. O'Donnell claimed that the ghost was a "Vice Elemental, the most harmful of all the denizens of the Spirit World". He describes how a clergyman, "The Rev. Mr H." and his family, who resided in the house, were tempted by the ghost. The ghost, keeping her face concealed, led "The Rev. Mr H." into drunkenness, and his children into cruelty towards animals, until they themselves behaved like pigs. She then revealed her face to the shocked family, who moved out of the house immediately.

Kampung Boy (TV series)

Kampung Boy is a Malaysian animated television series first broadcast in 1997. It is about the adventures of a young boy, Mat, and his life in a "<a href="Village%23Southeast%20Asia">kampung</a>" (village). The series is adapted from the best-selling graphical novel "<a href="The%20Kampung%20Boy">The Kampung Boy</a>", an autobiography of local cartoonist <a href="Lat">Lat</a>. Comprising two seasons and 26 episodes—one of which won an <a href="Annecy%20International%20Animated%20Film%20Festival">Annecy Award</a>—the series was first shown on Malaysian satellite television network <a href="Astro%20%28Malaysian%20satellite%20television%29">Astro</a> before being distributed to 60 other countries such as Canada and Germany, the series began airing on September 14, 1999 and ended on September 12, 2000.

A main theme of "Kampung Boy" is the contrast between the traditional rural way of life and the modern urban lifestyle. The series promotes the village lifestyle as an environment that is fun and conducive to the development of a healthy and intelligent child. It raises the issue of modernization, proposing that new values and technologies should be carefully examined by a society before being accepted.

Lat's animation has won praises for its technical work and refreshing content, although questions have been raised by <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>n audiences over its similarities with Western animation and its deviations from the local style of spoken English. Malaysian animation critics held up "Kampung Boy" as the standard to which their country's animators should aspire, and academics in cultural studies regarded the series as a method of using modern technologies and cultural practices to preserve Malaysian history.

In 1979, the autobiographical graphic novel "<a href="The%20Kampung%20Boy">The Kampung Boy</a>" was published. The story of a young <a href="Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Malay</a> boy's childhood in a "<a href="Village%23Southeast%20Asia">kampung</a>" (village) proved to be a commercial and critical success, establishing its author—<a href="Lat">Lat</a>—as the "most renowned cartoonist in Malaysia". "The Kampung Boy"s success prompted Lat to consider using other media to reach out to the masses.

The seeds for the animated adaptation of "The Kampung Boy" were sown in 1993 in a conversation between Lat and Ananda Krishman, founder of <a href="Astro%20%28Malaysian%20satellite%20television%29">Measat Broadcast Network Systems</a>. Western and Japanese cartoons flooded the local television channels during the 1990s, and Lat decried those productions for violence and jokes that he considered unsuitable for Malaysia and its youths. Recognising that the younger generation preferred colourful animations over static black and white drawings, Lat was keen for a local animated series to promote local values among Malaysian children. After Krishnan's company offered Lat financial support to start an animation project, the cartoonist began plans to adapt his trademark comic to the television screen.

Lat imagined several stories that he wished to see in animated form, and then looked abroad for help producing them. <a href="Lacewood%20Productions">Lacewood Studio</a> in Ottawa, Canada, was in charge of animating the pilot episode. World Sports and Entertainment of Los Angeles was involved as well; Norman Singer organised the production and Gerald Tripp helped Lat to write the script. Bobdog Production was responsible for animating another five episodes. However, Krishman and Lat were disappointed with the results, which had taken two years of work to produce. They thought the pilot was "slow-moving". Lat believed Lacewood had accommodated him too often during the production, accepting his input without question. They failed to inform him that although a slow pace worked for static cartoon drawings, a good animation was often "lively, fast-moving, full of action and fantasy".

In 1995, Lat and Krishman engaged Matinee Entertainment to complete the project, and Lat started to fly back and forth between Kuala Lumpur and Los Angeles to work closely with Matinee's employees. His experience with Matinee's team of writers and animators was positive; they were more proactive than Lacewood's, brainstorming his ideas and turning them into viable scripts and storyboards. Director Frank Saperstein performed the final edit, polishing up the scripts. Lat, however, had the final say with regards to cultural depictions, overriding several suggestions such as characters kissing in front of others and the use of Western street slang, as these were unpalatable to the Malaysian public. He also enforced accuracy in the depictions of objects such as bullock carts, noting that the American artists thought Malaysian carts were identical to their Mexican counterparts.

The storyboards were translated into animations by Philippine Animation Studios Incorporated in Manila. Lat again took several trips, this time to the Philippines, to advise the animators and ensure that everything was depicted accurately. Once the animation had been completed, the prints were sent to Vietnam for processing. Finally, the films were delivered to Krishnan's studio in Kuala Lumpur for voice recording in English and <a href="Malay%20language">Bahasa Malaysia</a>. Like Lat, Saperstein flew back and forth among the involved countries to coordinate efforts and make sure production standards never dropped. Saperstein's efforts for his first 12 episodes were enough to convince Lat to continue working with Matinee for the project.

The entire project took four years to complete; each episode cost approximately 350,000 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">United States dollar</a>s (approximately 1 million <a href="Malaysian%20ringgit">Malaysian ringgit</a>), partly funded by Measat, and took four to five months to produce. The pilot was shown over <a href="TV1%20%28Malaysia%29">TV1</a> on 10 February 1997, and the series began its broadcast over <a href="Astro%20Ria">Astro Ria</a> two-and-a-half years later. Kinder Channel (Germany) and <a href="Teletoon%20%28Canadian%20TV%20channel%29">Teletoon</a> (Canada) broadcast the series after buying the rights through London-based distributor Itel, and the series has been broadcast in more than 60 countries since its first airing in Malaysia. Measat expected to recover their investment in approximately 10 years. Although "Kampung Boy" originated in Malaysia, most of its production took place abroad. It was local in concept, but could be construed as a foreign production in terms of animation. This led to laments that had Malaysian studios been hired to participate in animation work, the country's industry would have benefited by learning from foreign animation expertise and methodology.

The protagonist of the series is a nine-year-old boy named Mat, who typically wears a "<a href="Sarong">sarong pelikat</a>" and a white singlet. Sporting a broad nose, small eyes, and untidy black hair, the short and rounded boy resembles his creator, Lat, as a child. Mat has a younger sister, Ana, and they live in a house with their father and mother, Yap and Yah, respectively. Their <a href="nuclear%20family">nuclear family</a> structure is predominant in the village. Yap's mother, Opah, does not live with them but is often seen in their house. Also frequently appearing are Mat's buddies, Bo and Tak, whose names are components of the Malay word "botak" (bald). The two are styled after comic characters of traditional "<a href="Wayang%23Wayang%20kulit">wayang kulit</a>" (shadow play); Bo is the more intelligent of the pair, while Tak has a tendency to be a show-off. Other supporting characters include Normah (a girl formerly from the city) and Mrs Hew (Mat's teacher).

The Malay and English voices of the characters were dubbed by Malaysian voice actors. Child actors were employed for the younger roles; however, Mat, Ana, Bo, and Tak were voiced by actors who were in their early twenties. Certain actors had the task of voicing multiple roles; for example, the voice director was responsible for speaking the roles of Mrs Hew and Yah. Initially, voice talents were hired in Los Angeles to dub the English version, but they "kept slipping into a Jamaican accent". Although this soundtrack was not used in the series, the producers felt it was too funny to waste and included it in "The Making of Kampung Boy", which was broadcast a week before the start of the series.

Whereas "Kampung Boy" the comic book was based on life in the 1950s, its animation spin-off was set in the 1990s. Although the scenery and details are exaggerated, the animation is accurate in its depiction of the Malaysian village and the life of its inhabitants. Dr Rohani Hashim, of Universiti Sains Malaysia's School of Communication, called the series a "detailed recreation of a rural Malay childhood". The layout of Mat's village and the style of its houses are patterned after those in the rural areas of Perak, Malaysia—clusters of houses line a river, which provides water for the villagers' needs. The children play in the surrounding jungle, while the adults toil in the fields and commute to the city to work.

Saperstein directed the use of warm and soft colours in the series; this colour scheme was modelled after that of "<a href="Winnie%20the%20Pooh%20%28character%29">Winnie the Pooh</a>", bestowing a "soft, cuddly feel", according to "<a href="Far%20Eastern%20Economic%20Review">Far Eastern Economic Review</a>" journalist S. Jayasankaran, to the animation. Much of the show's visuals followed Lat's art style. Outlines are drawn in bold manner, making objects stand out from the background—an effect particularly aided by the rich use of brown, green, and yellow as the primary colours. The last two colours are heavily used in the depictions of nature, contrasting well with each other and separating the background from the middle ground. Aside from being the main colour for the houses, brown is used as the skin tone of the characters. Drawn with "short and round shapes", Mat and his fellow Malays are highlighted with bright colours.

"Kampung Boy"s episodes follow a structure reminiscent of Hollywood cartoons. Each episode contains two separate stories whose themes interweave each other as the show switches between scenes of the two stories. By the end of the episode, the two threads are resolved by a common idea. Generally, one story focuses on the "kampung" children, and the other on the adults. The creators of "Kampung Boy" refrained from copying ideas commonly found in Western and Japanese cartoons. Other Malaysian animations produced since the 1990s have not been as meticulously faithful to portraying images and themes familiar to the locals—for example, "Sang Wira"s (1996) protagonist bears a striking resemblance to <a href="Doraemon">Doraemon</a>, and the bear and bee in "Ngat dan Taboh" (2002) play out antics similar to those of <a href="Tom%20and%20Jerry">Tom and Jerry</a>. Lat's close involvement with the project kept its portrayals faithful to Malaysian culture. "Kampung" life in the animation features "true-blue Malaysian elements" such as supernatural superstitions (<a href="Pontianak%20%28folklore%29">pontianaks</a> or female vampires), monkeys trained to pluck coconuts, and traditions that are forgotten in the transition from rural to urban living.

The cartoon series explores ideas through the activities of the characters, especially their interactions with one another. Rohani classified the genre of the show as comedy drama. According to her, the main theme in "Kampung Boy" is nostalgia, carrying Lat's intention to portray rural childhood as a "much more interesting and creative" experience than growing up in an urban environment. Several episodes champion the "kampung" way of life. In "Antara Jaguh & Rakan" ("Between Champions or Friends"), Mat and his friends defeat a city <a href="Association%20football">football</a> (soccer) team because of their toughness bred from doing hard work in the village. "SiMat Manusia Pintar" ("Smart Like a Flying Fox") suggests that the unpolluted environment of the "kampung" promotes the upbringing of a healthier and more intelligent child. Normah arrives from the city in "Mat Main Wayang" ("The Shadow Knows"), and although she disdains the "kampung" initially, she is won over by the villagers' tenderness toward her.

The intrusion of modern technology and attitudes into this idyllic "kampung" way of life is also a main topic in the series. Several episodes introduce electrical appliances and ideas associated with urban lifestyles to the villagers. For example, the convenience of motor cars versus the traditional use of bullock carts is debated by the characters in "Naik Keretaku" ("Dad's Driving Test"). Despite the show's support of the "kampung" lifestyle, it portrays aspects of modern living in a positive light as well. Opah, an old woman, is depicted as a capable modern woman, proficient in driving a van and fixing televisions. The city is characterized as a gateway to a range of cultures and ideas that are not found in a Malaysian rural village, as illustrated in the encounter and formation of a friendship between Mat and a Chinese boy in "Naik Keretaku".

The series also explores changes in Malaysian rural society that had taken place during the 1950s to 1990s. For example, through flashbacks, "Yah, Kahwinkan Kami!" ("Gone With Kahwin") displays traditional marriage customs that are no longer practiced by urban dwellers. Family ties are shown to be strong in the rural community—family members show close attention and concern to one another. Conversely, those who immersed themselves in city life are depicted to have lost their communal bonds. Although Mat's family is depicted to follow the rules of the Malay patriarchal society, modern values are in its portrayal. Yap does not leave the responsibilities of child-rearing all to Yah; he takes care of Ana while she watches over Mat. Although the series presents the female characters as housewives, it makes the point in "Nasib Si Gadis Desa" ("It's a Girl's Life") that the traditional family role of the Malay woman is as equal and valuable as the man's. The episode also mentions the achievements of women in careers such as space exploration and science.

Overall, Rohani said that Lat's cartoon series was subtly recording a story of "rapidly vanishing Malay tradition and innocence", while advising viewers to consider the societal changes around them. According to her, the cartoonist's concern was to inspire the audience to consider the pace of urbanisation and to realise that the adoption or rejection of new values is a common decision by them. The show, in her opinion, suggests that changes should be carefully examined and adopted only if beneficial to the society. Furthermore, the adoption of new ideas and culture should be a gradual process, and the changes tailored accordingly to the society.

"Kampung Boy" was submitted to the 1999 <a href="Annecy%20International%20Animated%20Film%20Festival">Annecy International Animated Film Festival</a> in France. One of its episodes, "Oh, Tok!", won the Best Animation for a television series of 13 minutes and more. The episode was about a spooky <a href="banyan">banyan tree</a> that became the object of Mat's fear. Because of the local contents in the animation and the nostalgic appeal of the "kampung" lifestyle, Malaysian comics scholar Muliyadi Mahamood expected success for "Kampung Boy" in his country.

The 26-episode series was popular with the young and received positive reviews for technical details and content. It has also attracted criticism for similarities to United States cartoon series "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>"; audiences noticed that Mat's Malaysian family was similar in several ways to Bart Simpson's dysfunctional American family. Similarly, some critics pointed out that the English spoken in "Kampung Boy" is substantially different from <a href="Malaysian%20English">Malaysian English</a>, which is heavily influenced by <a href="British%20English">British English</a>; reporter Daryl Goh perceived an American accent to the English-language voices. Lat explained that the producers had to tone down the use of "traditional Malay customs, locales and language" to market the series to a wider global audience. Rohani found the decision "regrettable"; it made the animation less than an authentic Malay product.

The animation was regarded by Dr Paulette Dellios, of <a href="Bond%20University">Bond University</a>'s School of Humanities and Social Sciences, as a cultural artefact: a reminder and preservation of a country's old way of life, created and produced by an international team, and displayed via modern technologies to the world. According to Rohani, "Kampung Boy" was a record of Malay traditions and transitions experienced by the rural community during the 1950s to 1990s. Among the several Malaysian animations that used local settings, Lat's series was in veteran film director Hassan Abdul Muthalib's view the best in portraying the country's culture and traditions; Hassan also said that the success in marketing the series overseas made "Kampung Boy" the benchmark for Malaysia's animation industry.

Bombing of Singapore (1944–1945)

The Bombing of Singapore (1944–45) was a military campaign conducted by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> air forces during World War II. <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) long-range bomber units conducted 11 air raids on Japanese-occupied <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> between November 1944 and March 1945. Most of these raids targeted the island's naval base and dockyard facilities, and minelaying missions were conducted in nearby waters. After the American bombers were redeployed, the British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> assumed responsibility for minelaying operations near Singapore and these continued until 24 May 1945.

The raids had mixed results. While significant damage was inflicted on Singapore's important naval base and commercial port, some raids on these targets were not successful and other attacks on oil storage facilities on islands near Singapore were ineffective. The minelaying campaign disrupted Japanese shipping in the Singapore area and resulted in the loss of three vessels and damage to a further ten, but was not decisive. The Allied air attacks were successful in raising the morale of Singapore's civilian population, who believed that the raids marked the impending liberation of the city. The overall number of civilian casualties from the bombings was low, though civilian workers were killed during attacks on military facilities; one attack rendered hundreds of people homeless.

In the decades after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Britain expanded <a href="Singapore%20Naval%20Base">Singapore Naval Base</a> at <a href="Sembawang">Sembawang</a> on Singapore's north coast as part of plans to deter Japanese expansionism in the region (the <a href="Singapore%20strategy">Singapore strategy</a>). The resulting facility was among the most important in the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and included the large King George VI <a href="Drydock%23Graving">graving dock</a> and Admiralty IX <a href="Drydock%23Floating">floating dry dock</a>. The Commonwealth forces allocated to <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a> and Singapore were swiftly defeated in the months after the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, however, and the island was surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. Singapore was bombed by Japanese aircraft on a number of occasions during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Malaya">Battle of Malaya</a> and subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">fighting on the island itself</a>; these raids caused many civilian deaths.
Singapore Naval Base suffered little damage during the fighting in 1941 and 1942, and became the most important facility of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) outside the Japanese home islands. As was the case under British rule, many locally recruited civilians worked in the base, though the Japanese Navy subjected them to harsh discipline which included physical beatings for minor mistakes as well as imprisonment or execution for theft and leaks of information. The Japanese <a href="2nd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">Second Fleet</a> and <a href="3rd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">Third Fleet</a> were transferred from the central Pacific to Singapore and the nearby <a href="Lingga%20Islands">Lingga Islands</a> between February and April 1944 to be closer to their sources of fuel oil. These two fleets comprised the main body of the IJN, and operated most of its remaining <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s.

The forces allocated to the defence of Singapore were not strong. In early 1945, Japanese air defences for the island included only two Army companies equipped with <a href="automatic%20cannon">automatic cannon</a>, some IJN anti-aircraft units, and a small number of fighter aircraft. Some of the anti-aircraft guns were crewed by Malay auxiliaries. The effectiveness of what was already an inadequate air defence force was hindered by a lack of coordination between the Army and Navy, shortages of fire control equipment for the guns, and no fire-control radar or <a href="barrage%20balloon">barrage balloon</a>s being available. Defence against night raids was particularly weak as no <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>s were stationed near Singapore and coordination between the anti-aircraft guns and searchlight units was poor.

In June 1944, the USAAF's <a href="XX%20Bomber%20Command">XX Bomber Command</a> began flying combat operations with <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> heavy bombers from air bases near <a href="Kharagpur">Kharagpur</a> in northeastern India. Although the Command's primary role was to attack industrial targets in the Japanese home islands, approximately 50 percent of its missions were undertaken to support other Allied operations in the Pacific. The XX Bomber Command reported to the USAAF's <a href="Twentieth%20Air%20Force">Twentieth Air Force</a>, which was personally directed from Washington, D.C., by the commander of the USAAF General <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry H. Arnold</a>, rather than the Allied <a href="Theater%20%28warfare%29">theatre</a> commanders in India and China. Major General <a href="Curtis%20LeMay">Curtis LeMay</a> assumed command of XX Bomber Command on 29 August after Arnold relieved its first commander.

Following the Japanese defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> in late October 1944, the remnants of the IJN were concentrated into two groups of ships. One group returned to bases in the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Inland Sea</a>, while the other was stationed at the Lingga Islands. On 27 October, Arnold suggested to LeMay that the Japanese defeat at Leyte might have increased the importance of Singapore's naval facilities and asked whether XX Bomber Command could attack targets on the island. Little recent intelligence on Singapore was available, and on 30 October a photo-reconnaissance B-29 overflew Singapore for the first time and took good photos of the island. Despite this success, LeMay's staff believed that a daylight attack on Singapore—which required a round trip from Kharagpur—could not be successful. Regardless, Arnold ordered that XX Bomber Command attack Singapore.

The first raid on Singapore took place on 5 November 1944. XX Bomber Command dispatched 76 B-29s from their bases around Kharagpur. Because of the extreme range to the target, the aircraft were each armed with only two 1,000 pound bombs; pilots were also instructed to bomb from the lower-than-normal altitude of , and to maintain a loose formation. The raid's primary target was the King George VI Graving Dock, and the Pangkalanbrandan refinery in northern <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> was assigned as the secondary target.

The first B-29s arrived over Singapore Naval Base at 06:44. Bombing was highly accurate, with the lead aircraft putting a bomb within of the graving dock's <a href="Caisson%20%28engineering%29">caisson</a> gate. The third B-29's bombs landed nearby and other aircraft also scored direct hits on the graving dock, rendering it unserviceable for three months. The bombs which landed in and near the King George VI Graving Dock also damaged the <a href="Cargo%20ship">freighter</a> that was under repair in it at the time. Many of the civilian workers in and around the dock were unable to escape and were killed. The raiders also inflicted damage on other facilities in the naval base. Overall, 53 Superfortresses bombed Singapore Naval Base while seven attacked Pangkalanbrandan refinery. Few Japanese anti-aircraft guns or aircraft fired on the raiders, but two B-29s were lost in accidents. This raid was the longest daylight bombing operation to have been conducted up to that time. Following the attack, Japanese soldiers murdered a group of injured Indonesian workers. The damage to the King George VI Graving Dock meant that it could not be used to repair the Japanese battleships damaged at the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

The next raid on Singapore took place in January 1945. Following reports that Japanese warships damaged during the <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">Philippines Campaign</a> were being repaired at Singapore, a force of 47 Superfortresses was dispatched from India to attack the Admiralty IX Floating Dock as well as the King's Dock on the island's south coast. These aircraft took off at about midnight on 10 January and began to arrive over Singapore at 08:20 on 11 January. Only 27 of the attackers struck the docks, and due to heavy anti-aircraft fire from Japanese warships in the <a href="Straits%20of%20Johor">Straits of Johor</a> the bombers did not cause any damage. The other aircraft bombed <a href="Penang">Penang</a> in Malaya, <a href="Mergui">Mergui</a> in Burma and several targets of opportunity, generally without success. Two B-29s were lost during this operation.

In January 1945, XX Bomber Command began preparations to redeploy to the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>. The Command ceased its attacks on Japan and East Asia, for which it used bases in China to refuel the B-29s "en route" to their targets, and instead focused on targets in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> that could be reached from Kharagpur. As there were few industrial targets within range of Kharagpur, the highest priority was given to attacking shipping in major ports such as <a href="Yangon">Rangoon</a>, <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> and Singapore as well as smaller harbours. Attacks were conducted through both conventional bombing and laying <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s. As part of the transition, LeMay departed for the Mariana Islands on 18 January and was replaced by Brigadier General Roger M. Ramsey.

XX Bomber Command conducted a major conventional bombing raid on Singapore Naval Base on 1 February. On that day, 112 B-29s were dispatched, each armed with four bombs. The raid's primary target, the Admiralty IX Floating Dock, was bombed by 67 of the 88 aircraft that reached Singapore. This attack sank the dry dock and destroyed the ship berthed inside it. The other 21 aircraft that attacked Singapore bombed the West Wall area of the naval base and destroyed many buildings and some heavy equipment; this area housed the base's main offices. Of the remaining aircraft, 20 diverted and attacked targets in Penang and <a href="Mottama">Martaban</a>. A Japanese fighter shot down one of the B-29s and another Superfortress was destroyed on landing after suffering damage from air attack.
Although XX Bomber Command began preparations to attack on Singapore Naval Base again on 6 February, this raid was cancelled on the third of the month by Admiral <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Louis Mountbatten</a>, the commander of Allied forces in the <a href="South-East%20Asian%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Southeast Asian theatre</a>. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at <a href="Kandy">Kandy</a>. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> area as XX Bomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King George VI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Saigon</a> was assigned as XX Bomber Command's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.

The next bombing raid on Singapore took place on 24 February. On that day, 116 B-29s were dispatched to bomb the Empire Dock area at Singapore's southern tip. This was a commercial dock, and was considered by XX Bomber Command planners to be "the only suitable primary target free of stipulations left in this theatre". The bombers were armed with <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiary bombs</a>, and the 105 B-29s which reached Singapore succeeded in burning out 39 percent of the warehouse area near the dock. Several oil storage tanks were also severely damaged. As a result of the target being obscured by smoke, 26 of the B-29s used blind rather than visual bombing, resulting in poor accuracy and damage to civilian residential and commercial areas near the dock area. More than 100 commercial and residential buildings were destroyed. The "<a href="The%20Straits%20Times">Syonan Shimbun</a>" newspaper subsequently reported that 396 people had been made homeless by the raid. USAAF losses were limited to a single B-29 which crashed after running out of fuel on its way back to India.
XX Bomber Command attacked Singapore again on 2 March. As many of the Command's service units were "en route" to the Marianas, only 64 B-29s could be dispatched. These aircraft targeted the shop and warehouse area in Singapore Naval Base with bombs. The 49 B-29s which reached Singapore bombed this area and added to the damage caused by earlier raids, but the results of the attack were again limited by anti-aircraft fire from Japanese warships. Two B-29s were shot down by anti-aircraft guns.

The final two raids conducted by XX Bomber Command before it deployed to the Marianas targeted oil storage facilities on islands in the Singapore area. On 12 March, three B-29 groups were dispatched to attack <a href="Pulau%20Bukom">Bukom</a> and <a href="Pulau%20Sebarok">Sebarok</a> islands just off the south coast of Singapore as well as <a href="Sambu%20Island">Samboe Island</a>, which is a few miles south near <a href="Batam">Batam Island</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Each of the groups was assigned a different island and no Japanese anti-aircraft guns or fighters were encountered. Despite this, poor weather meant that the 44 B-29s which reached the target area had to use blind bombing techniques and their attacks caused little damage. The command's final attack before it departed for the Marianas took place on the night of 29/30 March when 29 Superfortresses were sent to attack Bukom Island. In order to train the aircrew for the low-level tactics which were being used against the Japanese home islands, the bombers attacked their targets individually from altitudes between and . This raid destroyed seven of the 49 oil tanks in the island, and a further three were damaged. No B-29s were lost in either attack.

As part of its campaign against shipping, around each full moon from late January 1945 XX Bomber Command conducted <a href="Minelayer">minelaying missions</a>. On the night of 25/26 January, 41 B-29s from the <a href="444th%20Bombardment%20Group">444th</a> and <a href="468th%20Bombardment%20Group">468th Bombardment Group</a>s laid six minefields in the approaches to Singapore. On the same night other B-29s laid mines off Saigon and <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Bay">Cam Ranh Bay</a> as part of the largest single aerial minelaying effort in the Pacific up to that time. On the night of 27/28 February, twelve B-29s were dispatched to lay mines in the Straits of Johor near Singapore. Ten of these aircraft successfully deployed 55 mines in the target area, and another aircraft mined Penang. During the next full moon period on the night of 28/29 March, 22 B-29s laid mines near Singapore. No aircraft were lost during these missions.

Following the withdrawal of XX Bomber Command, the British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s <a href="No.%20222%20Group%20RAF">No. 222 Group</a> assumed responsibility for minelaying operations in the Singapore area using <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> bombers. Minelaying ceased on 24 May so that unswept mines did not interfere with the planned <a href="Operation%20Zipper">British-led landings in Malaya</a> which were scheduled for September. The Japanese established observation posts on islands in the <a href="Singapore%20Strait">Singapore Strait</a> to spot minefields, but these were not effective and generally the fields were not detected until a ship struck a mine. In total, air-dropped mines sank three ships near Singapore and damaged another ten. Moreover, the minefields disrupted Japanese convoy routes and efforts to repair ships. The Allied minelaying campaign was too brief to achieve decisive results, however.

XX Bomber Command's attacks on <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> produced mixed results. The raids on Singapore Naval Base damaged or destroyed many workshops and denied the Japanese the use of the King George VI Graving Dock between late 1944 and early 1945, and the Admiralty IX Dry Dock from February 1945. In addition, workers at the Naval Base did not return to work for some time after each raid, and had to be provided with better pay and rations and additional <a href="air-raid%20shelter">air-raid shelter</a>s. Although the damage inflicted on the Empire Docks area impeded Japanese port operations, the poor condition of the port area also hindered British efforts to rehabilitate Singapore following the war. The attacks on the oil storage tanks on islands near Singapore were less successful, and many were found to still be operable after the Japanese surrender.

The Japanese military's efforts to defend Singapore from air attack were unsuccessful. Due to the weak state of the island's air defences, only nine B-29s were shot down during the American campaign, all of them during daylight raids. <a href="Demining">Minesweeping</a> operations were also slow, and it took three weeks to declare the port safe after each Allied minelaying raid. The surviving crew members of the American bombers that were shot down met varying fates; a small number linked up with resistance movements such as the <a href="Malayan%20Peoples%27%20Anti-Japanese%20Army">Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army</a>, while others were captured by the Japanese and held in harsh conditions. Those who were captured by the IJN and held at the Naval Base were beheaded. After the war, the Japanese personnel believed responsible for atrocities against these prisoners were tried during the <a href="Seletar%20War%20Crimes%20Trials">Seletar War Crimes Trials</a> and those found guilty were executed or served long prison sentences.

The air raids on Singapore raised the morale of the island's civilian population. They were seen as heralding Singapore's liberation from Japan's oppressive rule, though civilians were generally careful to hide this belief from Japanese occupation personnel. The B-29s were widely believed to be invulnerable, and civilians were cheered by their apparent ability to attack the Japanese at will. In an attempt to counter this view, the occupation authorities exhibited wreckage from downed B-29s and surviving crew members as well as film footage of a Superfortress being shot down. This propaganda campaign was not successful. The Japanese also failed in their attempts to rouse <a href="Islam%20in%20Singapore">Singapore's Muslim population</a> against the raids by highlighting damage suffered by a mosque on 11 January and 24 February, the latter a raid which coincided with the celebration of <a href="Mawlid">Muhammad's birthday.</a> Another factor which contributed to public support for the raids was that the policy of targeting military installations meant that only a small number of civilians became casualties, and the American bombing came to be seen as highly accurate. The expectation of further attacks caused the prices of food and other commodities to rise, however, as people stockpiled necessities; Japanese attempts to stop this hoarding and profiteering were not successful.

1689 Boston revolt

The 1689 Boston revolt was a popular uprising on April 18, 1689 against the rule of Sir <a href="Edmund%20Andros">Edmund Andros</a>, the governor of the <a href="Dominion%20of%20New%20England">Dominion of New England</a>. A well-organized "mob" of provincial militia and citizens formed in the town of Boston, the capital of the dominion, and arrested dominion officials. Members of the Church of England were also taken into custody if they were believed to sympathize with the administration of the dominion. Neither faction sustained casualties during the revolt. Leaders of the former <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> then reclaimed control of the government. In other colonies, members of governments displaced by the dominion were returned to power.

Andros was commissioned governor of New England in 1686. He had earned the enmity of the local populace by enforcing the restrictive <a href="Navigation%20Acts">Navigation Acts</a>, denying the validity of existing land titles, restricting town meetings, and appointing unpopular regular officers to lead colonial militia, among other actions. Furthermore, he had infuriated Puritans in Boston by promoting the Church of England, which was rejected by many nonconformist New England colonists.

In the early 1680s, King <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II of England</a> began taking steps to reorganize the colonies of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. The charter of the <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> was revoked in 1684 after its leaders refused to act on his demands for reforms in the colony, when Charles sought to streamline the administration of the colonies and bring them more closely under crown control. He died in 1685 but his successor continued the efforts, Roman Catholic <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, culminating in his creation of the <a href="Dominion%20of%20New%20England">Dominion of New England</a>. He appointed former <a href="Province%20of%20New%20York">New York</a> governor Sir <a href="Edmund%20Andros">Edmund Andros</a> as dominion governor in 1686. The dominion was composed of the territories of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Colony</a>, <a href="Connecticut%20Colony">Connecticut Colony</a>, the <a href="Province%20of%20New%20Hampshire">Province of New Hampshire</a>, and the <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a>. In 1688, its jurisdiction was expanded to include New York, <a href="East%20Jersey">East Jersey</a>, and <a href="West%20Jersey">West Jersey</a>.

Andros's rule was extremely unpopular in New England. He disregarded local representation, denied the validity of existing land titles in Massachusetts (which had been dependent on the old charter), restricted town meetings, and forced the Church of England into largely Puritan regions. He also enforced the <a href="Navigation%20Acts">Navigation Acts</a> which threatened the existence of certain trading practices of New England. The royal troops stationed in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> were often mistreated by their officers, who were supporters of the governor and often either Anglican or Roman Catholic.

Meanwhile, King James became increasingly unpopular in England. He alienated otherwise supportive Tories with his attempts to relax the Penal Laws, and he issued the <a href="Declaration%20of%20Indulgence">Declaration of Indulgence</a> in 1687 which established some freedom of religion, a move opposed by the Anglican church hierarchy. He increased the power of the regular army, an action seen by many Parliamentarians as a threat to their authority, and placed Catholics in important military positions. James also attempted to place sympathizers in Parliament who he hoped would repeal the <a href="Test%20Act">Test Act</a> which required a strict Anglican religious test for many civil offices. Some Whigs and Tories set aside their political differences when his son and potential successor <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James</a> was born in June 1688, and they conspired to replace him with his Protestant son-in-law <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William, Prince of Orange</a>. The Dutch prince had tried unsuccessfully to get James to reconsider his policies; he agreed to an invasion, and the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">nearly bloodless revolution</a> that followed in November and December 1688 established William and his wife <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a> as co-rulers.

The religious leaders of Massachusetts were led by <a href="Cotton%20Mather">Cotton</a> and <a href="Increase%20Mather">Increase Mather</a>. They were opposed to the rule of Andros, and they organized dissent targeted to influence the court in London. Increase Mather sent an appreciation letter to the king regarding the Declaration of Indulgence, and he suggested to other Massachusetts pastors that they also express gratitude to him as a means to gain favor and influence. Ten pastors agreed to do so, and they sent Increase Mather to England to press their case against Andros. Dominion secretary <a href="Edward%20Randolph%20%28colonial%20administrator%29">Edward Randolph</a> repeatedly attempted to stop him, including pressing criminal charges, but Mather clandestinely boarded a ship bound for England in April 1688. He and other Massachusetts agents were received by King James in October 1688, who promised that the colony's concerns would be addressed. The events of the revolution, however, halted this attempt to gain redress.

The Massachusetts agents then petitioned the new monarchs and the Lords of Trade (predecessors to the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> that oversaw colonial affairs) for restoration of the Massachusetts charter. Mather furthermore convinced the Lords of Trade to delay notifying Andros of the revolution. He had already dispatched a letter to previous colonial governor <a href="Simon%20Bradstreet">Simon Bradstreet</a> containing news of a report (prepared before the revolution) that the annulment of the Massachusetts charter had been illegal, and he urged the magistrates to "prepare the minds of the people for a change". Rumors of the revolution apparently reached some individuals in Boston before official news arrived. Boston merchant <a href="John%20Nelson%20%28merchant%29">John Nelson</a> wrote of the events in a letter dated late March, and the letter prompted a meeting of senior anti-Andros political and religious leaders in Massachusetts.

Andros first received a warning of the impending upheaval to his control while leading an expedition to fortify Pemaquid (<a href="Bristol%2C%20Maine">Bristol, Maine</a>), intending to protect the area against French and Indian attacks. In early January 1688/9, he received a letter from King James describing the Dutch military buildup. On January 10, he issued a proclamation warning against Protestant agitation and prohibiting an uprising against the dominion. The military force that he led in Maine was composed of British regulars and militia from Massachusetts and Maine. The militia companies were commanded by regulars who imposed harsh discipline that alienated the militiamen from their officers. Andros was alerted to the meetings in Boston and also received unofficial reports of the revolution, and he returned to Boston in mid-March. A rumor circulated that he had taken the militia to Maine as part of a so-called "popish plot;" the Maine militia mutinied, and those from Massachusetts began to make their way home. A proclamation announcing the revolution reached Boston in early April; Andros had the messenger arrested, but his news was distributed, emboldening the people. Andros wrote to his commander at Pemaquid on April 16 that "there is a general buzzing among the people, great with expectation of their old charter", even as he prepared to have the returning deserters arrested and shipped back to Maine. The threat of arrests by their own colonial militia increased tensions between the people of Boston and the dominion government.

At about 5 a.m. on April 18, militia companies began gathering outside Boston at <a href="Charlestown%2C%20Massachusetts">Charlestown</a> just across the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles River</a>, and at <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Boston">Roxbury</a>, located at the far end of the <a href="Boston%20Neck">neck</a> connecting Boston to the mainland. At about 8 a.m., the Charlestown companies boarded boats and crossed the river while the Roxbury companies marched down the neck and into the city. Simultaneously, men from the <a href="Ancient%20and%20Honorable%20Artillery%20Company%20of%20Massachusetts">Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company</a> entered the homes of the regimental drummers in the city, confiscating their equipment. The militia companies met up at about 8:30, joined by a growing crowd, and began arresting dominion and regimental leaders. They eventually surrounded Fort Mary where Andros was quartered.

Among the first to be arrested was Captain John George of who came ashore between 9 and 10 a.m., only to be met by a platoon of militia and the ship's carpenter who had joined the Americans. George demanded to see an arrest warrant, and the militiamen drew their swords and took him into custody. By 10 a.m., most of the dominion and military officials had either been arrested or had fled to the safety of <a href="Castle%20Island%20%28Massachusetts%29">Castle Island</a> or other fortified outposts. Boston Anglicans were rounded up by the people, including a church warden and an apothecary. Sometime before noon, an orange flag was raised on <a href="Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Boston">Beacon Hill</a> signaling another 1,500 militiamen to enter the city. These troops formed up in the market square, where a declaration was read which supported "the noble Undertaking of the Prince of Orange", calling the people to rise up because of a "horrid "Popish Plot"" that had been uncovered.

The Massachusetts colonial leadership headed by ex-governor Simon Bradstreet then urged Governor Andros to surrender for his own safety. He refused and tried to escape to "Rose", but the militia intercepted a boat that came ashore from "Rose", and Andros was forced back into Fort Mary. Negotiations ensued and Andros agreed to leave the fort to meet with the council. He was promised safe conduct and marched under guard to the townhouse where the council had assembled. There he was told that "they must and would have the Government in their own hands", as an anonymous account describes it, and that he was under arrest. He was taken to the home of dominion official John Usher and held under close watch.

"Rose" and Fort William on Castle Island refused to surrender initially. On the 19th, however, the crew aboard "Rose" was told that the captain had planned to take the ship to France to join the exiled King James. A struggle ensued, and the Protestants among the crew took down the ship's rigging. The troops on Castle Island saw this and surrendered.

Fort Mary surrendered on the 19th, and Andros was moved there from Usher's house. He was confined with <a href="Joseph%20Dudley">Joseph Dudley</a> and other dominion officials until June 7, when he was transferred to Castle Island. A story circulated widely that he had attempted an escape dressed in women's clothing. This was disputed by Boston's Anglican minister Robert Ratcliff, who claimed that such stories had "not the least foundation of Truth" but were "falsehoods and lies" propagated to "render the Governour odious to his people". Andros did make a successful escape from Castle Island on August 2 after his servant bribed the sentries with liquor. He managed to flee to Rhode Island but was recaptured soon after and kept in what was virtually solitary confinement. He and others arrested in the wake of the revolt were held for 10 months before being sent to England for trial. Massachusetts agents in London refused to sign the documents listing the charges against Andros, so he was summarily acquitted and released. He later served as governor of <a href="Province%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="Province%20of%20Maryland">Maryland</a>.

The other New England colonies in the dominion were informed of the overthrow of Andros, and colonial authorities moved to restore the governmental structures which had been in place prior to the dominion's enforcement. Rhode Island and Connecticut resumed governance under their earlier charters, and Massachusetts resumed governance according to its vacated charter after being temporarily governed by a committee composed of magistrates, Massachusetts Bay officials, and a majority of Andros's council. New Hampshire was temporarily left without formal government and was controlled by Massachusetts and its governor Simon Bradstreet, who served as "de facto" ruler of the northern colony. Plymouth Colony also resumed its previous form of governance.

During his captivity, Andros had been able to send a message to <a href="Francis%20Nicholson">Francis Nicholson</a>, his New York-based lieutenant governor. Nicholson received the request for assistance in mid-May, but most of his troops had been sent to Maine and he was unable to take any effective action because tensions were also rising in New York. Nicholson himself was <a href="Leisler%27s%20Rebellion">overthrown</a> by a faction led by <a href="Jacob%20Leisler">Jacob Leisler</a>, and he fled to England. Leisler governed New York until 1691 when a detachment of troops arrived followed by <a href="Henry%20Sloughter">Henry Sloughter</a>, commissioned governor by William and Mary. Sloughter had Leisler tried on charges of high treason; he was convicted and executed.

No further effort was made by English officials to restore the shattered dominion after the suppression of Leisler's Rebellion and the reinstatement of colonial governments in New England. Once Andros' arrest was known, the discussion in London turned to dealing with Massachusetts and its revoked charter. This led to formation of the <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> in 1691, merging Massachusetts with <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Colony</a> and territories previously belonging to New York, including <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>, <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a>, the <a href="Elizabeth%20Islands">Elizabeth Islands</a>, and parts of Maine. <a href="Increase%20Mather">Increase Mather</a> was unsuccessful in his attempts to restore the old Puritan rule; the new charter called for an appointed governor and religious toleration.

Sack of Amorium

The Sack of Amorium by the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a> in mid-August 838 was one of the major events in the long history of the <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20Wars">Arab–Byzantine Wars</a>. The Abbasid campaign was led personally by the Caliph <a href="al-Mu%27tasim">al-Mu'tasim</a> (reigned 833–842), in retaliation to a virtually unopposed expedition launched by the <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Theophilos%20%28emperor%29">Theophilos</a> (r. 829–842) into the <a href="Al-%27Awasim">Caliphate's borderlands</a> the previous year. Mu'tasim targeted <a href="Amorium">Amorium</a>, a <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> city in western <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> (modern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>), because it was the birthplace of the <a href="Amorian%20dynasty">ruling Byzantine dynasty</a> and, at the time, one of Byzantium's largest and most important cities. The caliph gathered an exceptionally large army, which he divided in two parts, which invaded from the northeast and the south. The northeastern army defeated the Byzantine forces under Theophilos <a href="Battle%20of%20Anzen">at Anzen</a>, allowing the Abbasids to penetrate deep into Byzantine-held Asia Minor and converge upon <a href="Ancyra">Ancyra</a>, which they found abandoned. After sacking the city, they turned south to Amorium, where they arrived on 1 August. Faced with intrigues at Constantinople and the rebellion of the large <a href="Khurramite">Khurramite</a> contingent of his army, Theophilos was unable to aid the city.

Amorium was strongly fortified and garrisoned, but a traitor revealed a weak spot in the wall, where the Abbasids concentrated their attack, effecting a breach. Unable to break through the besieging army, Boiditzes, the commander of the breached section privately attempted to negotiate with the Caliph without notifying his superiors. He concluded a local truce and left his post, which allowed the Arabs to take advantage, enter the city and capture it. Amorium was systematically destroyed, never to recover its former prosperity. Many of its inhabitants were slaughtered, and the remainder driven off as slaves. Most of the survivors were released after a truce in 841, but prominent officials were taken to the caliph's capital of <a href="Abbasid%20Samarra">Samarra</a> and executed years later after refusing to convert to <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, becoming known as the <a href="42%20Martyrs%20of%20Amorium">42 Martyrs of Amorium</a>.

The conquest of Amorium was not only a major military disaster and a heavy personal blow for Theophilos, but also a traumatic event for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of <a href="Byzantine%20Iconoclasm">Iconoclasm</a>, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.

By 829, when the young emperor Theophilos ascended the Byzantine throne, the Byzantines and Arabs had been fighting on and off for almost two centuries. At this time, Arab attacks resumed both in the east, where after almost twenty years of peace due to the <a href="Fourth%20Fitna">Abbasid civil war</a> Caliph <a href="al-Ma%27mun">al-Ma'mun</a> (r. 813–833) launched several large-scale raids, and in the west, where the gradual <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Sicily">Muslim conquest of Sicily</a> was under way since 827. Theophilos was an ambitious man and also a convinced adherent of <a href="Byzantine%20Iconoclasm">Byzantine Iconoclasm</a>, which prohibited the depiction of divine figures and the veneration of <a href="icon">icon</a>s. He sought to bolster his regime and support his religious policies by military success against the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>, the Empire's major antagonist.
Seeking divine favour, and responding to <a href="iconophile">iconophile</a> plots against him, Theophilos reinstated active suppression of the iconophiles and other perceived "heretics" in June 833, including mass arrests and exiles, beatings and confiscations of property. In Byzantine eyes, God seemed indeed to reward this decision: al-Ma'mun died during the first stages of a new, large-scale invasion against Byzantium that was intended to be the first step in conquering <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> itself, and his brother and successor <a href="al-Mu%27tasim">al-Mu'tasim</a> withdrew to focus on internal matters, having trouble establishing his authority, and needing to confront the ongoing rebellion of the <a href="Khurramite">Khurramite</a> religious sect under <a href="Babak%20Khorramdin">Babak Khorramdin</a>. This allowed Theophilos to achieve a series of modest victories over the next few years, as well as to bolster his forces with some 14,000 Khurramite refugees under their leader Nasr, who was baptized a Christian and took the name <a href="Theophobos">Theophobos</a>. The emperor's successes were not particularly spectacular, but coming after two decades of defeats and civil war under iconophile emperors, Theophilos felt justified in claiming them as vindication for his religious policy. Consequently, the emperor began to publicly associate himself with the memory of the militarily successful and fanatically iconoclast emperor <a href="Constantine%20V">Constantine V</a> (r. 741–775), and issued a new type of the copper "<a href="follis">follis</a>" coin, minted in huge numbers, which portrayed him as the archetypical victorious Roman emperor.

In 837, Theophilos decided—at the urging of the hard-pressed Babak—to take advantage of the Caliphate's preoccupation with the suppression of the Khurramite revolt and lead a major campaign against the <a href="Al-%27Awasim">frontier emirates</a>. He assembled a very large army, some 70,000 fighting men and 100,000 in total according to <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Jarir%20al-Tabari">al-Tabari</a>, and invaded Arab territory around the upper <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> almost unopposed. The Byzantines took the towns of <a href="Sozopetra">Sozopetra</a> and <a href="Arsamosata">Arsamosata</a>, ravaged and plundered the countryside, extracted ransom from several cities in exchange for not attacking them, and defeated a number of smaller Arab forces. While Theophilos returned home to celebrate a <a href="Roman%20triumph">triumph</a> and be acclaimed in the <a href="Hippodrome%20of%20Constantinople">Hippodrome of Constantinople</a> as the "incomparable champion", the refugees from Sozopetra began arriving at Mu'tasim's capital, <a href="Abbasid%20Samarra">Samarra</a>. The caliphal court was outraged by the brutality and brazenness of the raids: not only had the Byzantines acted in open collusion with the Khurramite rebels, but during the sack of Sozopetra—which some sources claim as Mu'tasim's own birthplace—all male prisoners were executed and the rest sold into slavery, and some captive women were raped by Theophilos's Khurramites. Theophilos's campaign was unable, however, to save Babak and his followers, who in late 837 were forced from their mountain strongholds by the general <a href="Afshin%20%28Caliphate%20General%29">Afshin</a>. Babak fled to <a href="Emirate%20of%20Armenia">Armenia</a>, but was betrayed to the Abbasids and died of torture.

With the Khurramite threat over, the caliph began marshalling his forces for a reprisal campaign against Byzantium. A huge Arab army gathered at <a href="Tarsus%20%28city%29">Tarsus</a>; according to the most reliable account, that of <a href="Michael%20the%20Syrian">Michael the Syrian</a>, it numbered some 80,000 men with 30,000 servants and camp followers and 70,000 pack animals. Other writers give far larger numbers, ranging from 200,000 to 500,000 according to <a href="al-Mas%27udi">al-Mas'udi</a>. Unlike earlier campaigns, which did not go far beyond attacking the forts of the frontier zone, this expedition was intended to penetrate deep into <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> and exact vengeance. The great city of <a href="Amorium">Amorium</a> in particular was the intended prize. The Arab chronicles record that Mu'tasim asked his advisors to name the "most inaccessible and strongest" Byzantine fortress, and they named Amorium, "where no Muslim has gone since the appearance of Islam. It is the eye and foundation of Christendom; among the Byzantines, it is more famous than Constantinople". According to Byzantine sources, the caliph had the city's name written on the shields and banners of his soldiers. The capital of the powerful <a href="Anatolic%20Theme">Anatolic Theme</a>, the city was strategically located at the western edge of the <a href="Anatolian%20plateau">Anatolian plateau</a> and controlled the main southern route followed by the Arab invasions. At the time, Amorium was one of the largest cities in the Byzantine Empire, ranking in importance immediately after Constantinople. It was also the birthplace of Theophilos's father, <a href="Michael%20II%20the%20Amorian">Michael II the Amorian</a> (r. 820–829), and perhaps of Theophilos himself. Due to its strategic importance, the city had been a frequent target of Arab attacks in the 7th and 8th centuries, and Mu'tasim's predecessor Ma'mun was said to be planning to attack the city when he died in 833.

The caliph divided his force in two: a detachment of 10,000 Turks under Afshin was sent northeast to join forces with the emir of <a href="Malatya">Malatya</a> <a href="Umar%20al-Aqta">Umar al-Aqta</a> and Armenian troops (the <a href="Artsruni">Artsruni</a> and <a href="Bagratuni%20Dynasty">Bagratuni</a> rulers of <a href="Vaspurakan">Vaspurakan</a> and <a href="Taron%20%28historic%20Armenia%29">Taron</a> respectively both participated in person in the campaign) and invade the <a href="Armeniac%20Theme">Armeniac Theme</a> from the Pass of <a href="Hadath">Hadath</a>, while the main army under the caliph himself would invade <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a> through the <a href="Cilician%20Gates">Cilician Gates</a>. The advance guard of the latter was led by <a href="Ashinas">Ashinas</a>, with <a href="Itakh">Itakh</a> commanding the right, <a href="Ja%27far%20ibn%20Dinar%20al-Khayyat">Ja'far ibn Dinar al-Khayyat</a> the left and <a href="%27Ujayf%20ibn%20%27Anbasa">'Ujayf ibn 'Anbasa</a> the centre. The two forces would link up at <a href="Ancyra">Ancyra</a>, before marching jointly on Amorium. On the Byzantine side, Theophilos was soon made aware of the caliph's intentions, and set out from Constantinople in early June. His army included men from the Anatolian and possibly also the European <a href="Theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29">themes</a>, the elite "<a href="tagma%20%28military%29">tagma</a>ta" regiments, as well as the Khurramites. The Byzantines expected the Arab army to advance north to Ancyra after passing through the Cilician Gates and then to turn south toward Amorium, but it was also possible that the Arabs would march directly over the Cappadocian plain to Amorium. Although his generals advised evacuation of the city, with the intention of rendering the Arabs' campaign objective void and keeping the Byzantine army undivided, Theophilos decided to reinforce the city's garrison, with Aetios the "<a href="strategos">strategos</a>" of the Anatolics, and men from the "tagmata" of the <a href="Excubitors">Excubitors</a> and the <a href="Vigla%20%28tagma%29">Vigla</a>.

With the rest of his army, Theophilos then marched to interpose himself between the Cilician Gates and Ancyra, camping on the north bank of the river <a href="Halys%20River">Halys</a>, close to one of the major river crossings. Ashinas crossed the Cilician Gates on 19 June, and the caliph himself with his main army set out on the march two days later. The Arab advance was slow and cautious. Anxious to avoid an ambush and learn the emperor's whereabouts, Mu'tasim forbade Ashinas to advance too deeply into Cappadocia. Ashinas sent out many scouting detachments to take captives, and from them finally learned of Theophilos's presence at the Halys, where he awaited the Arab approach to give battle. At the same time, around mid-July, Theophilos learned of the arrival of Afshin's army, comprising some 30,000 men, at the plain of Dazimon. Leaving a part of his army under a relative to watch the crossings of the Halys, Theophilos immediately departed with most of his army, some 40,000 men according to Michael the Syrian, to confront the smaller Arab force. Mu'tasim learned of Theophilos's departure from captives and tried to warn Afshin, but the emperor was faster and met Afshin's army in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Anzen">Battle of Anzen</a> on the plain of Dazimon on 22 July. Despite initial success, the Byzantine army broke and scattered, while Theophilos with his guard were encircled and barely managed to break through and escape.
Theophilos quickly began regrouping his forces and sent the general <a href="Theodore%20Krateros">Theodore Krateros</a> to Ancyra. Krateros found the city completely deserted, and was ordered to reinforce the garrison of Amorium instead. Theophilos himself was soon forced to return to Constantinople, where rumours of his death at Anzen had led to plots to declare a new emperor. At the same time, the Khurramites, gathered around <a href="Sinop%2C%20Turkey">Sinope</a>, revolted and declared their reluctant commander Theophobos emperor. Luckily for the Empire, Theophobos maintained a passive stance and made no move to confront Theophilos or join Mu'tasim. The caliph's vanguard under Ashinas reached Ancyra on 26 July. The inhabitants, who had sought refuge in some mines nearby, were discovered and taken captive after a brief struggle by an Arab detachment under <a href="Malik%20ibn%20Kaydar">Malik ibn Kaydar al-Safadi</a>. The Byzantines, some of whom were soldiers who had fled from Anzen, informed the Arabs of Afshin's victory, after which Malik allowed all of them to go free. The other Arab forces arrived at Ancyra over the next days, and after plundering the deserted city, the united Arab army turned south towards Amorium.

The Arab army marched in three separate corps, with Ashinas once again in front, the caliph in the middle, and Afshin bringing up the rear. Looting the countryside as they advanced, they arrived before Amorium seven days after their departure from Ancyra, and began their siege of the city on 1 August. Theophilos, anxious to prevent the city's fall, left Constantinople for <a href="Dorylaion">Dorylaion</a>, and from there sent an embassy to Mu'tasim. His envoys, who arrived shortly before or during the first days of the siege, offered assurances that the atrocities at Sozopetra had been against the emperor's orders, and further promised to help rebuild the city, to return all Muslim prisoners, and to pay a tribute. The caliph, however, not only refused to parley with the envoys, but detained them in his camp, so that they could observe the siege.

The city's fortifications were strong, with a wide moat and a thick wall protected by 44 towers, according to the contemporary geographer <a href="Ibn%20Khordadbeh">Ibn Khordadbeh</a>. The caliph assigned each of his generals to a stretch of the walls. Both besiegers and besieged had many <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s, and for three days both sides exchanged missile fire while Arab sappers tried to undermine the walls. According to Arab accounts, an Arab prisoner who had converted to Christianity defected back to the caliph, and informed him about a place in the wall which had been badly damaged by heavy rainfall and only hastily and superficially repaired due to the city commander's negligence. As a result, the Arabs concentrated their efforts on this section. The defenders tried to protect the wall by hanging wooden beams to absorb the shock of the siege engines, but they splintered, and after two days a breach was made. Immediately Aetios realized that the defence was compromised, and decided to try and break through the besieging army during the night and link up with Theophilos. He sent two messengers to the emperor, but both were captured by the Arabs and brought before the caliph. Both agreed to convert to Islam, and Mu'tasim, after giving them a rich reward, paraded them around the city walls in full view of Aetios and his troops. To prevent any sortie, the Arabs stepped up their vigilance, maintaining constant cavalry patrols even during the night.

The Arabs now launched repeated attacks on the breach, but the defenders held firm. At first, according to al-Tabari, catapults manned by four men each were placed on wheeled platforms, and mobile towers with ten men each were constructed and advanced to the edge of the moat, which they began to fill with sheep skins (from the animals they had brought along as food) filled with earth. However, the work was uneven due to the soldiers' fear of the Byzantine catapults, and Mu'tasim had to order earth to be thrown over the skins to pave the surface up to the wall itself. A tower was pushed over the filled moat, but became stuck midway and it and the other siege engines had to be abandoned and burned. Another attack on the next day, led by Ashinas, failed due to the narrowness of the breach, and Mu'tasim eventually ordered more catapults brought forward to widen it. The next day Afshin with his troops attacked the breach, and Itakh on the day after. The Byzantine defenders were gradually worn down by the constant assaults, and after about two weeks of siege (the date is variously interpreted as 12, 13 or 15 August by modern writers) Aetios sent an embassy under the city's bishop, offering to surrender Amorium in exchange for safe passage of the inhabitants and garrison, but Mu'tasim refused. The Byzantine commander Boiditzes, however, who was in charge of the breach section, decided to conduct direct negotiations with the caliph on his own, probably intending to betray his own post. He went to the Abbasid camp, leaving orders for his men in the breach to stand down until his return. While Boiditzes parleyed with the caliph, the Arabs came closer to the breach, and at a signal charged and broke into the city. Taken by surprise, the Byzantines' resistance was sporadic: some soldiers barricaded themselves in a monastery and were burned to death, while Aetios with his officers sought refuge in a tower before being forced to surrender.

The city was thoroughly sacked and plundered; according to the Arab accounts, the sale of the spoils went on for five days. The Byzantine chronicler <a href="Theophanes%20Continuatus">Theophanes Continuatus</a> mentions 70,000 dead, while the Arab al-Mas'udi records 30,000. The surviving population were divided as slaves among the army leaders, except for the city's military and civic leaders, who were reserved for the caliph's disposal. After allowing Theophilos's envoys to return to him with the news of Amorium's fall, Mu'tasim burned the city to the ground, with only the city walls surviving relatively intact. Among the spoils taken were the massive iron doors of the city, which al-Mu'tasim initially transported to Samarra, where they were installed at the entrance of his palace. From there they were taken, probably towards the end of the century, and installed at <a href="Raqqa">Raqqa</a>, where they remained until 964, when the <a href="Hamdanid">Hamdanid</a> ruler <a href="Sayf%20al-Dawla">Sayf al-Dawla</a> had them removed and incorporated in the <a href="Bab%20Qinnasrin">Bab al-Qinnasrin</a> gate in his capital <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>.

Immediately after the sack, rumours reached the caliph that Theophilos was advancing to attack him. Mu'tasim set out with his army a day's march along the road in the direction of Dorylaion, but encountered no sign of a Byzantine attack. According to al-Tabari, Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when news reached him of a conspiracy headed by his nephew, <a href="al-Abbas%20ibn%20al-Ma%27mun">al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun</a>. Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, leaving intact the fortresses around Amorium as well as Theophilos and his army in Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.
Theophilos now sent a second embassy to the caliph, headed by the "<a href="tourmarches">tourmarches</a>" of <a href="Charsianon">Charsianon</a>, Basil, bearing gifts and an apologetic letter, and offering to ransom the high-ranking prisoners for 20,000 <a href="Pound%20%28mass%29%23Byzantine%20litra">Byzantine pounds</a> (about 6,500 kg) of gold and to release all Arabs held captive by the Byzantines. In reply, Mu'tasim refused the ransom, saying that the expedition alone had cost him over 100,000 pounds, and demanded the surrender of Theophobos and the <a href="Domestic%20of%20the%20Schools">Domestic of the Schools</a>, <a href="Manuel%20the%20Armenian">Manuel the Armenian</a>, who had some years ago deserted from Arab service. The Byzantine ambassador refused to comply to this and indeed could not, as Theophobos was in revolt and Manuel had died, according to some accounts, from wounds received at Anzen. Instead, Basil handed over a second, much more threatening letter by Theophilos. Mu'tasim, angered by this, returned the emperor's gifts.

In the aftermath of the sack of Amorium, Theophilos sought the aid of other powers against the Abbasid threat: embassies were sent to both the western emperor <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis the Pious</a> (r. 813–840) and to the court of <a href="Abd%20ar-Rahman%20II">Abd ar-Rahman II</a> (r. 822–852), <a href="Emir%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Emir of Córdoba</a>. The Byzantine envoys were received with honours, but no help materialized. The Abbasids, however, did not follow up on their success. Warfare continued between the two empires with raids and counter-raids for several years, but after a few Byzantine successes a truce and possibly also a <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20prisoner%20exchanges">prisoner exchange</a>—which excluded the high-ranking captives from Amorium—was agreed in 841. At the time of his death in 842, Mu'tasim was preparing yet another large-scale invasion, but the great fleet he had prepared to assault Constantinople perished in a storm off <a href="Cape%20Chelidonia">Cape Chelidonia</a> a few months later. Following Mu'tasim's death, the Caliphate entered a prolonged period of unrest, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mauropotamos">Battle of Mauropotamos</a> in 844 was the last major Arab–Byzantine engagement until the 850s.

Among the captured Byzantine magnates of Amorium, the "strategos" Aetios was executed soon after his capture, perhaps, as the historian <a href="Warren%20Treadgold">Warren Treadgold</a> suggests, in retaliation to Theophilos's second letter to the caliph. After years of captivity and no hope of ransom, the rest were urged to convert to Islam. When they refused, they were executed at Samarra on 6 March 845, and are celebrated in the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium. Several tales also sprung up around Boiditzes and his betrayal. According to the legend of the 42 Martyrs, he converted to Islam, but was nevertheless executed by the caliph alongside the other captives; unlike the others, however, whose bodies "miraculously" floated in the water of the river <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a>, his sank to the bottom.

The sack of Amorium was one of the most devastating events in the long history of Arab raids into Anatolia. Theophilos reportedly fell ill soon after the city's fall, and although he recovered, his health remained in poor state until his death, three years later. Later Byzantine historians attribute his death before the age of thirty to his sorrow over the impact of the city's loss, although this is most likely a legend. The fall of Amorium inspired several legends and stories among the Byzantines, and can be traced in surviving literary works such as the "<a href="Song%20of%20Armouris">Song of Armouris</a>" or the ballad "<a href="Kastro%20tis%20Orias%20%28ballad%29">Kastro tis Orias</a>" ("Castle of the Fair Maiden"). Arabs on the other hand celebrated the capture of Amorium, which became the subject of <a href="Abu%20Tammam">Abu Tammam</a>'s famous "Ode on the Conquest of Amorium". In addition, caliphal propaganda made use of the campaign to legitimize al-Mu'tasim's rule and justify his subsequent murder of his nephew and the rightful heir to al-Ma'mun, al-Abbas.

In reality, the campaign's military impact on Byzantium was limited: outside the garrison and population of Amorium itself, the Byzantine field army at Anzen seems to have suffered few casualties, and the revolt of the Khurramite corps was suppressed without bloodshed the next year and its soldiers reintegrated into the Byzantine army. Ancyra was quickly rebuilt and reoccupied, as was Amorium itself, although it never recovered its former glory and the seat of the Anatolic theme was for a time transferred to <a href="Polybotus">Polybotus</a>. According to the assessment of Warren Treadgold, the imperial army's defeats at Anzen and Amorium were to a large degree the result of circumstance rather than actual incapability or inadequacy. In addition, the Byzantine campaign had suffered from Theophilos's overconfidence, both in his willingness to divide his forces in the face of greater Arab numbers and in his over-reliance on the Khurramites. Nevertheless, the defeat prompted Theophilos to undertake a major reorganization of his army, which included the establishment of new frontier commands and the dispersing of the Khurramite troops among the native troops of the themes.

The most long-term and long-lasting result of the fall of Amorium, however, was in the religious rather than in the military sphere. Iconoclasm was supposed to bring divine favour and assure military victory, but neither the army's weaknesses nor the reported treachery of Boiditzes could detract from the fact that this was "a humiliating disaster to match the worst defeats of any iconophile emperor" (Whittow), comparable in recent memory only to the crushing defeat suffered by <a href="Nikephoros%20I">Nikephoros I</a> (r. 802–811) at <a href="Battle%20of%20Pliska">Pliska</a>. As Warren Treadgold writes, "the outcome did not exactly prove that Iconoclasm was wrong ... but it did rob the iconoclasts for all time of their most persuasive argument to the undecided, that Iconoclasm won battles". A little over a year after Theophilos's death, on 11 March 843, a synod <a href="Feast%20of%20Orthodoxy">restored</a> the veneration of <a href="icons">icons</a>, and iconoclasm was declared heretical.

Bharattherium

Bharattherium is a <a href="mammal">mammal</a> that lived in <a href="India">India</a> during the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> (latest <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>) and possibly the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>. The <a href="genus">genus</a> has a single <a href="species">species</a>, Bharattherium bonapartei. It is part of the <a href="Gondwanatheria">gondwanathere</a> family <a href="Sudamericidae">Sudamericidae</a>, which is also found in Madagascar and South America during the latest Cretaceous. The first fossil of "Bharattherium" was discovered in 1989 and published in 1997, but the animal was not named until 2007, when two teams independently named the animal "Bharattherium bonapartei" and "Dakshina jederi". The latter name is now a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a>. "Bharattherium" is known from a total of eight isolated fossil teeth, including one <a href="incisor">incisor</a> and seven molariforms (<a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>-like teeth, either <a href="premolars">premolars</a> or true molars).

"Bharattherium" molariforms are high, curved teeth, with a height of . In a number of teeth tentatively identified as fourth lower molariforms (mf4), there is a large furrow on one side and a deep cavity (infundibulum) in the middle of the tooth. Another tooth, perhaps a third lower molariform, has two furrows on one side and three infundibula on the other. The <a href="tooth%20enamel">tooth enamel</a> has traits that have been interpreted as protecting against cracks in the teeth. The <a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a> (high-crowned) teeth of sudamericids like "Bharattherium" are reminiscent of later grazing mammals, and the discovery of grass in Indian fossil sites contemporaneous with those yielding "Bharattherium" suggest that sudamericids were indeed grazers.

A <a href="gondwanathere">gondwanathere</a> tooth, catalogued as VPL/JU/NKIM/25, was first discovered in the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> (latest <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, about 70–66 million years ago) <a href="Intertrappean%20Beds">Intertrappean Beds</a> of <a href="Naskal">Naskal</a>, India, in 1989, but it was not identified as such until another gondwanathere, "<a href="Lavanify">Lavanify</a>", was found on Madagascar in the middle 1990s. The discoveries of "Lavanify" and VPL/JU/NKIM/25 were announced in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" in 1997. Gondwanatheres were previously known only from Argentina; these discoveries extended the range of the gondwanathere family <a href="Sudamericidae">Sudamericidae</a> across the continents of the ancient supercontinent of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>.

In 2007, two teams of scientists independently named the Indian gondwanathere on the basis of new material; both teams included VPL/JU/NKIM/25 in their newly named species. Guntupalli Prasad and colleagues named the animal "Bharattherium bonapartei" on the basis of an additional tooth, VPL/JU/IM/33, from another Intertrappean locality, <a href="Kisalpuri">Kisalpuri</a>. The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "Bharattherium", combines "Bharat", <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> for "India", with the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "therion", meaning "beast", and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "bonapartei", honors Argentine paleontologist <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bonaparte">José Bonaparte</a>, who was the first to describe a gondwanathere fossil. G.P. Wilson and colleagues named "Dakshina jederi" on the basis of six teeth (in addition to VPL/JU/NKIM 25), and identified some additional material as indeterminate gondwanatheres. Of these teeth, three (GSI/SR/PAL-G059, G070, and G074) are from a third Intertrappean site at <a href="Gokak">Gokak</a> and three (GSI/SR/PAL-N071, N210, and N212) are from Naskal. "Dakshina", the generic name, derives from Sanskrit "daakshinaatya" "of the south", and refers both to the animal's occurrence in southern India and to the distribution of gondwanatheres in the southern continents. The specific name, "jederi", honors <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> paleontologist <a href="Jeffrey%20A.%20Wilson">Jeffrey A. Wilson</a>, nicknamed "Jeder", who played an important role in the project that led to the discovery of "Dakshina". Wilson and colleagues also described three other gondwanathere teeth from Gokak (GSI/SR/PAL-G111, G112, and G211), which they tentatively identified as a different species of gondwanathere on their small size. In 2008, Prasad commented that "Bharattherium bonapartei" and "Dakshina jederi" represented the same species and that "Bharattherium", which was published first, was the correct name.

"Bharattherium bonapartei" is known from a total of eight isolated teeth. Among the seven teeth in their sample, Wilson and colleagues tentatively identified five as fourth lower molariforms (mf4)—because gondwanathere <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s and <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> cannot be distinguished, they are collectively known as "molariforms"—one as a third lower molariform (mf3) and one as a lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a> (i1). These determinations were made on the basis of comparisons with a sample of the South American gondwanathere "<a href="Sudamerica%20ameghinoi">Sudamerica ameghinoi</a>", in which all eight molariform positions are known. However, the large number of mf4s led Wilson and colleagues to suspect that the criteria used for distinguishing "Sudamerica" tooth positions may not apply directly to "Bharattherium". Prasad and colleagues did not assign their two "Bharattherium" teeth to any tooth position, but suggested that they may represent different tooth positions and that one may come from the upper and the other from the lower side of the jaw. As is characteristic of sudamericids, "Bharattherium" molariforms are <a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a> (high-crowned) and have a flat occlusal (chewing) surface atop a high tooth, with furrows that extend down the height of the tooth. "Bharattherium" molariforms are the smallest of any sudamericid; those of "Lavanify", for example, are about 35% larger. Unlike "Sudamerica" molariforms, those of "Bharattherium" taper towards the top.

GSI/SR/PAL-G074, a well-preserved right mf4 that Wilson and colleagues selected as the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of "Dakshina jederi", is 7.57 mm high and has a crown of 3.66 × 2.99 mm. It is curved, with the base more distal (towards the back) than the top. The occlusal surface is rectangular. On the lingual side (towards the tongue), there is a deep furrow (filled in part with <a href="cementum">cementum</a>) that extends from the top to near the base of the tooth. There is also a much smaller indentation on the buccal side (towards the cheeks). The occlusal surface is mostly covered with <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> surrounding a <a href="dentine">dentine</a> lake, but there is a V-shaped islet in the middle, with the tip of the V towards the lingual side, that forms the remnant of an <a href="wikt%3Ainfundibulum">infundibulum</a>—a deep cavity in the tooth. <a href="Perikymata">Perikymata</a>—wave-like bands and grooves—are visible in the enamel.

The right mf4 GSI/SR/PAL-G070, which is damaged on the buccal, distal, and lingual sides, is 8.40 mm high, but has an occlusal surface of only 2.49 × 1.75 mm. Unlike in GSI/SR/PAL-G074, the dentine on the occlusal surface is not exposed, and the occlusal surface is oval in shape. Furthermore, the V-shaped islet is larger and the lingual furrow is less prominent at the occlusal surface, because it tapers near the tip of the tooth. In the heavily damaged left mf4 GSI/SR/PAL-N071 (height 7.16 mm), only the distal side is well preserved. The infundibulum is exposed internally; it extends 4.01 mm down the crown. The occlusal surface is poorly preserved, but its dimensions are at least 2.14 × 2.42 mm. GSI/SR/PAL-N212, a right mf4, is damaged on the mesial side and has a height of 5.86 mm and an occlusal surface of at least 2.66 x 2.04 mm. Cementum fills the V-shaped islet.

VPL/JU/NKIM/25 was the first Indian gondwanathere fossil to be described; it is damaged on one side. Wilson and colleagues identified it as a left mf4 (implying that the damaged side is buccal) with strong similarities to GSI/SR/PAL-G070, including a curved crown and a V-shaped enamel islet atop a deep infundibulum. The occlusal surface is oval. The tooth is 6 mm high and Wilson and colleagues estimate that the occlusal surface is 2.5 × 1.8 mm, close to the dimensions of GSI/SR/PAL-G070. They suggest the tooth probably had enamel on all sides of the crown, but Prasad and colleagues point to a possible <a href="enamel-dentine%20junction">enamel-dentine junction</a> on the damaged side as evidence that enamel may be absent there.

GSI/SR/PAL-G059, identified as a left mf3, has a height of 5.97 mm at the mesial side, but only 2.02 mm at the distal side because of curvature. On the lingual side, two long furrows are visible, and on the buccal side breakage exposes three long infundibula, of which the most mesial one is the longest and the most distal one the shortest. In the occlusal surface, these three infundibula merge into a single islet. In addition, three dentine lakes are visible in the occlusal surface, which has dimensions of 4.58 × at least 2.52 mm. Although in "Sudamerica", mf2, mf3, and the upper molariforms MF3 and MF4 all have three lophs, like GSI/SR/PAL-G059, its curvature matches the mf3 of "Sudamerica" best.

VPL/JU/IM/33, the holotype of "Bharattherium bonapartei", is 7.33 mm high, 2.66 mm long, and 2.0 mm wide. The occlusal surface is about rectangular and is mostly covered by a V-shaped dentine lake, which encloses a small heart-shaped enamel islet at the top of an cementum-filled infundibulum. A vertical furrow is also present. Near the top of the tooth, enamel covers the entire crown, but further down there is no enamel on the concave face of the tooth.

The left i1 GSI/SR/PAL-N210 is flat on the medial side (towards the middle of the head) but convex on the lateral side (towards the side of the head) and bears a shallow groove on the lateral side. At the base, the tooth is broadest on the lower end. The tooth is slightly curved upward towards the tip. Measured on the lower side, the tooth is 11.76 mm long, but breakage means the true length is probably larger. The depth of the tooth is about 3.39 mm. Wilson and colleagues identified this incisor as "Dakshina" on the basis of its size; the upper and lower incisor that they assigned to an indeterminate gondwanathere are smaller.

The microstructure of the enamel of VPL/JU/NKIM/25 has been studied. Unlike other gondwanatheres, it has enamel consisting of three layers—radial enamel, tangential enamel, and PLEX. The rows of small, round <a href="enamel%20prism">enamel prism</a>s are separated by <a href="interprismatic%20matrix">interprismatic matrix</a> that forms crystals oriented at right angles relative to the prisms. Prisms arise at the enamel-dentine junction, run through the enamel, and meet the outer enamel at a high angle. These features of the enamel are apparently adaptations that protect the tooth from cracks.

"Bharattherium" is identifiable as a sudamericid because it has hypsodont molariforms with cementum-filled furrows. Among the four known sudamericid genera—"Gondwanatherium" and "Sudamerica" from Argentina; "Lavanify" from Madagascar; and "Bharattherium"—it shares with "Sudamerica" and "Lavanify" the presence of furrows that extend down to the base of the tooth. In addition, it shares several features with "Lavanify", suggesting the two are closely related. Wilson and colleagues list three features shared by the two: the presence of an infundibulum (seen in only one of two specimens of "Lavanify"), interprismatic matrix, and perikymata. Prasad and colleagues also interpreted the interprismatic matrix as a shared character, but added the absence of enamel on one side of the tooth crown. Wilson and colleagues identified the presence of a V-shaped enamel lake on mf4 and of three layers in the enamel as <a href="autapomorphy">autapmorphies</a> (uniquely derived characters) of the Indian sudamericid.

Remains of "Bharattherium" have been found at three widely separated Late Cretaceous sites in peninsular India—Naskal, <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>; Gokak, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>; and Kisalpuri, <a href="Madhya%20Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a>. All sites are in the <a href="Intertrappean%20Beds">Intertrappean Beds</a> (part of the <a href="Deccan%20Traps">Deccan Traps</a>) and are <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> (latest <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>) in age. The Intertrappean Beds have yielded a variety of fossil animals, including <a href="eutheria">eutheria</a>n mammals such as "<a href="Deccanolestes">Deccanolestes</a>", "<a href="Sahnitherium">Sahnitherium</a>", and "<a href="Kharmerungulatum">Kharmerungulatum</a>". In the perhaps slightly older <a href="Infratrappean%20Beds">Infratrappean Beds</a>, a possible member of the ancient and enigmatic mammalian group <a href="Haramiyida">Haramiyida</a> has been found, "<a href="Avashishta">Avashishta</a>". Members of the family Sudamericidae, in which "Bharattherium" is classified, are also known from the Cretaceous of Argentina, Madagascar, and possibly Tanzania and from the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> of Argentina and Antarctica, and the second gondwanathere family, <a href="Ferugliotheriidae">Ferugliotheriidae</a>, is known with certainty only from the Cretaceous of Argentina. Thus, "Bharattherium" is an example of a <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>n faunal element in India and indicates <a href="biogeography">biogeographic</a> affinities with other Gondwanan landmasses such as Madagascar and South America.

In modern mammals, hypsodont teeth are often associated with diets that include abrasive vegetation such as <a href="grass">grass</a>es. Hypsodonty in sudamericids has been interpreted as indicating semiaquatic, terrestrial habits and a diet with items like roots or bark, because it was thought that grasses had not yet appeared when sudamericids lived. However, grass remains have been found at Intertrappean sites contemporary with those where "Bharattherium" was found, suggesting that sudamericids like "Bharattherium" were indeed the first grazing mammals.

It is among the two Indian mammal taxa that are inferred to have survived the <a href="KT%20event">KT event</a> in <a href="India">India</a>, alongside "<a href="Deccanolestes">Deccanolestes</a>".

Komm, du süße Todesstunde, BWV 161

<a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> composed the <a href="church%20cantata">church cantata</a> (Come, you sweet hour of death), 161, in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> for the 16th Sunday after <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity</a>, probably first performed on 27 September 1716.

Bach had taken up regular cantata composition two years before when he was promoted to concertmaster at the Weimar court, writing one cantata per month to be performed in the , the court chapel in the ducal <a href="Schloss%20Weimar">"Schloss"</a>. The text of , and of most other cantatas written in Weimar, was provided by court poet <a href="Salomon%20Franck">Salomon Franck</a>. He based it on the prescribed gospel reading about the <a href="young%20man%20from%20Nain">young man from Nain</a>. His text reflects on longing for death, seen as a transition to a life united with Jesus. The text includes as a closing <a href="chorale">chorale</a> the fourth <a href="stanza">stanza</a> of the <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "" by <a href="Christoph%20Knoll">Christoph Knoll</a>.

The cantata in six <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movement</a>s opens with a sequence of alternating <a href="aria">aria</a>s and <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s leading to a chorus and a concluding chorale. The chorale tune, known as "", appears in the first movement, played by the organ, and musical <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a>s of the arias are derived from it, providing an overall formal unity to the composition. Bach scored the work for two vocal parts (<a href="alto">alto</a> and <a href="tenor">tenor</a>), a <a href="SATB">four-part choir</a>, and a <a href="Baroque%20instruments">Baroque chamber ensemble</a> of recorders, strings and continuo. In the alto recitative (movement 4), accompanied by all instruments, Bach creates the images of sleep, of waking up, and of funeral bells, the latter in the recorders and <a href="pizzicato">pizzicato</a> of the strings.

While the <a href="libretto">libretto</a> was published in a collection in 1715, Bach probably did not perform it until 27 September 1716, due to a period of public mourning of six months in the <a href="Saxe-Weimar">Duchy of Weimar</a> from August 1715. Bach revived the cantata when he was "<a href="Thomaskantor">Thomaskantor</a>" in Leipzig, but not for <a href="Bach%20cantata%23Leipzig">his cantata cycles</a>, which included three new works for the 16th Sunday after Trinity. He performed with minor changes between 1737 and 1746. He also assigned it to the occasion of <a href="Purification%20of%20the%20Virgin">Purification</a>, a feast with a similar topic.

Born in 1685, Bach established his reputation as an outstanding organist while in his teens. He moved to Weimar in 1708 to take up a position as court organist to the co-reigning dukes <a href="William%20Ernest%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar">Wilhelm Ernst</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Augustus%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Ernst August</a> of <a href="Saxe-Weimar">Saxe-Weimar</a>. He had already begun to compose cantatas at his previous posts at <a href="Arnstadt">Arnstadt</a> and <a href="M%C3%BChlhausen">Mühlhausen</a>, and his reasons for moving included disappointment with the standard of singing at the churches where he had worked. He was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle on 2 March 1714. In that position, he assumed principal responsibility for composing new works. Specifically, he was tasked with providing cantatas for the "Schlosskirche" (palace church) on a monthly schedule, which would result in <a href="Church%20cantata%20%28Bach%29">a complete annual cycle</a> for the <a href="liturgical%20year">liturgical year</a> within four years. While Bach had composed vocal music only for special occasions until his promotion, the chance to regularly compose and perform a new work resulted in a program into which Bach "threw himself wholeheartedly", as the Bach scholar <a href="Christoph%20Wolff">Christoph Wolff</a> notes.

The cantatas which were probably first performed in 1716 used texts by the Weimar court poet <a href="Salomon%20Franck">Salomon Franck</a>, published in his collections (1715) and (1717). Fewer cantatas have survived from this period than from the years before; possibly some were lost, and possibly some proposed cantatas were never written, reflecting Bach's loss of interest.

From the start of the liturgical year on the first Sunday in Advent, Bach composed prolifically. He wrote works for three consecutive Sundays in Advent, prompted probably by the death of the Kapellmeister <a href="Johann%20Samuel%20Drese">Johann Samuel Drese</a> on 1 December 1716. When Bach's hope to become Drese's successor was not realized, he ceased to compose cantatas for the Weimar court.

These works were performed by Bach as concertmaster in 1716, according to Wolff and <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%BCrr">Alfred Dürr</a>, an authority on Bach's cantatas:

Bach wrote for the <a href="Church%20cantata%2316th%20Sunday%20after%20Trinity%20%28Trinity%20XVI%29">16th Sunday after Trinity</a>. The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Ephesians">Epistle to the Ephesians</a>, about the strengthening of faith in the congregation of <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> (), and from the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, about the raising from the dead of the <a href="young%20man%20from%20Nain">young man from Nain</a> (). In Bach's time the story pointed at the resurrection of the dead, expressed in words of desire to die soon.

Franck's text was published in in 1715. He included as the closing chorale the fourth <a href="stanza">stanza</a> of the hymn "" (1611) by <a href="Christoph%20Knoll">Christoph Knoll</a>. Franck wrote a libretto full of biblical references, including (in the first <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movement</a>) "feeding on honey from the lion's mouth", based on . Dürr summarizes that Franck wrote "a deeply felt, personal confession of longing for Jesus". The Bach scholar <a href="Richard%20D.%20P.%20Jones">Richard D. P. Jones</a> notes that the cantata is "one of the most richly inspired of all Bach's Weimar cantatas", and sees the text as a part of the inspiration, with its "mystical longing for union with Christ".

Bach led the first performance, but its date has been debated. Dürr concluded initially (in the first edition of his book "Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach" of 1971) that the cantata was first performed on 6 October 1715, but this date fell in a period of public mourning in Weimar. In August 1715 the brother of Duke Ernst August died, only 18 years old, and the duke proclaimed six months of mourning in the <a href="Saxe-Weimar">Duchy of Weimar</a>. Cantata performances were resumed sooner, with the 21st Sunday after Trinity on 10 November 1715. Now, the first performance of the work is generally accepted as the same occasion the following year, when the 16th Sunday after Trinity fell on 27 September 1716, by Wolff, the publisher <a href="Carus-Verlag">Carus-Verlag</a>, and Dürr in the revised and translated edition of 2006. Richard D. P. Jones notes in his book "The Creative Development of Johann Sebastian Bach" that "technical novelties" also suggest that the cantata was composed in 1716, according to a recent study.

In 1723, his first year as "<a href="Thomaskantor">Thomaskantor</a>" in Leipzig, Bach composed a new cantata for the 16th Sunday after Trinity, . A year later he wrote a <a href="Chorale%20cantata%20%28Bach%29">chorale cantata</a> for his <a href="Chorale%20cantata%20cycle">second cantata cycle</a>, , and for his third cantata cycle there he composed . He revived in Leipzig, but only later, in a version dated sometime between 1737 and 1746, with minor changes to the scoring. He even performed it for a different liturgical occasion, the feast of the <a href="Church%20cantata%20%28Bach%29%23Purification">Purification of Mary</a> on 2 February. The prescribed readings for the Purification included <a href="Simeon%20%28Gospel%20of%20Luke%29">Simeon</a>'s <a href="canticle">canticle</a> "<a href="Nunc%20dimittis">Nunc dimittis</a>" (), which with its line "now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace" has a similar theme.

The cantata is structured in six movements: a series of alternating <a href="aria">aria</a>s and <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s leads to a chorus and a concluding chorale. As with several other cantatas based on words by Franck, it is scored for a small ensemble: <a href="alto">alto</a> soloist (A), <a href="tenor">tenor</a> soloist (T), a <a href="SATB">four-part choir</a> and a <a href="Baroque%20instruments">Baroque chamber ensemble</a> of two <a href="recorder%20%28musical%20instrument%29">recorders</a> (Fl), two <a href="violin">violin</a>s (Vl), <a href="viola">viola</a> (Va), <a href="Organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> (Org) and <a href="basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a> (Bc). The title page reads simply: "Auf den sechzenden Sontag nach Trintatis" (For the sixteenth Sunday after Trinity). The duration is given as 19 minutes.

One structural element is the anticipation of the closing chorale in the first movement, where the chorale melody is used as a <a href="cantus%20firmus">cantus firmus</a>. Bach also used this approach to unify the structure in two other Weimar cantatas, , and . He later used the juxtaposition of a chorale cantus firmus against vocal music on a grand scale in his "<a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion">St Matthew Passion</a>", in both <a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion%20structure%231">the opening chorus</a> and <a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion%20structure%2329">the movement concluding Part I</a>. The use of recorders in is reminiscent of the early cantata "Actus tragicus", .

At the Leipzig performances of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a <a href="soprano">soprano</a>, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria. The cantata was transposed from <a href="C%20major">C major</a> to <a href="E-flat%20major">E-flat major</a> at Leipzig, where the recorders may have been replaced by <a href="flauto%20traverso">transverse flutes</a>.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring and <a href="Key%20%28music%29">keys</a> are given for the version performed in Weimar in 1716. The keys and <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s are taken from Dürr, using the C symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.

A <a href="Phrygian%20mode">Phrygian</a> chorale melody, well known as the melody of "", provides the musical theme of the cantata, appearing in movement one in both its original form and the alto line derived from it. The themes of the two other <a href="aria">aria</a>s are taken from the same melody, providing formal unity. The same melody appears five times in chorales of Bach's "St Matthew Passion".

The opening aria for alto, "" ("Come, o sweet hour of death" or "Come, thou sweet hour of parting") is accompanied by the recorders. They move in the <a href="ritornello">ritornello</a> in parallel thirds and sixths. The organ serves not only as a bass instrument but supplies the chorale melody. In Weimar, Bach seems to have expected the congregation to know the words of the first stanza of Knoll's hymn.

Jones points out that the cantus firmus of the organ seems "objective", in contrast to the subjective "display of personal feeling" of the voice and the complexity of the other parts.

In a later performance in Leipzig, a soprano sang the stanza with the organ.

The tenor recitative, "" (World, your pleasure is a burden), begins as a <a href="Recitative%23Secco">secco recitative</a>, but ends in an <a href="arioso">arioso</a> as the words paraphrase a biblical verse from , "" to "Ich habe Lust, bei Christo bald zu weiden. Ich habe Lust, von dieser Welt zu scheiden" (I desire to pasture soon with Christ. I desire to depart from this world). Dürr notes that the development from secco to arioso is frequent in Bach's early cantatas, and is here especially motivated to highlight the biblical paraphrase.

The aria for tenor, "" (My longing
is, to embrace my Savior), is the first movement with the strings, adding depth to the emotional expression. It returns to the hope for union with Jesus of the first movement, expressed in an agitated way, with <a href="Syncope%20%28music%29">syncopies</a> for "longing" and flowing <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a>s for "embracing". The middle section is mostly accompanied by the continuo only, but at times interjected by the strings playing the "longing"-motifs.

The alto recitative, "" (The end has already come), is accompanied by all instruments, creating images of sleep (in a downward movement, ending in long notes), awakening (in fast movement upwards), and funeral bells in the recorders and <a href="pizzicato">pizzicato</a> of the strings. The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes: "In this movement the anticipation of death appears to be fulfilled, and the alto's declamation, welcoming death and the ringing of the funeral bells, is filled with a pathos amounting almost to obsession."

The first choral movement 5,"" (If it is my God's will), is marked "aria" by Franck. Bach set it for four parts, using song-like <a href="homophony">homophony</a>. Wolff compares the style to Thuringian <a href="motet">motet</a>s of around 1700. The first part is not repeated <a href="da%20capo">da capo</a>, in keeping with the last words "" (May this be my last word). While a textual da capo is impossible, Bach composed a musical da capo, giving the movement a structure of ABB'A'. Dürr notes that "Arnold Schering has drawn attention to the increasing rapture".

The closing chorale, "" (The body, indeed, in the earth), is illuminated by a fifth part of the two recorders playing a lively counterpoint in <a href="unison">unison</a>.
The "soaring descant" of the recorders has been interpreted as "creating the image of the flesh transfigured".

Wolff summarizes: "Cantata 161 is one of the most delicate and jewel-like products of Bach's years in Weimar. The writing in up to ten parts is extraordinarily subtle. ... The recorders additionally contribute in no small way to the spiritualised emotion and positive feelings associated with the 'sweet hour of death. Jones writes: "Bach's arrival at full maturity by about the middle of his Weimar period (1713–17) is attested by the stylistic and technical assurance, and the consistently high standard, of his writing at that time." He counts the cantata as one of several that reached a level of mastery unsurpassed in later years, along with the <a href="Orgelb%C3%BCchlein">Orgelbüchlein</a> and the cantata <a href="Ich%20hatte%20viel%20Bek%C3%BCmmernis%2C%20BWV%2021">"Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis", BWV 21</a>, among others.

The cantata was edited by <a href="Franz%20W%C3%BCllner">Franz Wüllner</a> for the <a href="Bach%20Gesellschaft%20Ausgabe">Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe</a>, the first complete edition of Bach's works, in a volume published in 1887. The <a href="New%20Bach%20Edition">New Bach Edition</a> (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score of both the Weimar and the Leipzig version in 1982, edited by , with the critical commentary following in 1984.

<a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a> performed the cantata twice in the Bach year 2000 as part of the <a href="Bach%20Cantata%20Pilgrimage">Bach Cantata Pilgrimage</a> with the Monteverdi Choir. One performance was on the anniversary of Bach's death, 28 July, at <a href="Iona%20Abbey">Iona Abbey</a>, and the other on the 16th Sunday after Trinity (8 October) at the church of the <a href="Convent%20of%20San%20Domingos%20de%20Bonaval">Convent of San Domingos de Bonaval</a> in <a href="Santiago%20de%20Compostela">Santiago de Compostela</a>.

Maya stelae

Maya stelae (singular stela) are monuments that were fashioned by the <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya civilization</a> of ancient <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>. They consist of tall, sculpted stone shafts and are often associated with low circular stones referred to as altars, although their actual function is uncertain. Many <a href="stele">stelae</a> were sculpted in low <a href="relief">relief</a>, although plain monuments are found throughout the Maya region. The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout the Maya area during the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology%23Classic%20Era">Classic Period</a> (250–900 AD), and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization. The earliest dated stela to have been found "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>" in the Maya lowlands was recovered from the great city of <a href="Tikal">Tikal</a> in <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.

Stelae became closely associated with the concept of <a href="Imperial%20cult">divine kingship</a> and declined at the same time as this institution. The production of stelae by the <a href="Maya%20peoples">Maya</a> had its origin around 400 BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period, around 900, although some monuments were reused in the <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology%23Postclassic%20Era">Postclassic</a> (c. 900–1521). The major city of <a href="Calakmul">Calakmul</a> in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> raised the greatest number of stelae known from any <a href="Maya%20city">Maya city</a>, at least 166, although they are very poorly preserved.

Hundreds of stelae have been recorded in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with <a href="Maya%20script">hieroglyphic text</a>. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at <a href="Cop%C3%A1n">Copán</a> and <a href="Tonin%C3%A1">Toniná</a>. Plain stelae do not appear to have been painted nor overlaid with <a href="stucco">stucco</a> decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.

Stelae were essentially stone <a href="banner">banner</a>s raised to glorify the king and record his deeds, although the earliest examples depict <a href="Maya%20mythology">mythological</a> scenes. Imagery developed throughout the Classic Period, with Early Classic stelae (c. 250–600) displaying non-Maya characteristics from the 4th century onwards, with the introduction of imagery linked to the central Mexican metropolis of <a href="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a>. This influence receded in the 5th century although some minor Teotihuacan references continued to be used. In the late 5th century, Maya kings began to use stelae to mark the end of <a href="Maya%20calendar">calendrical cycles</a>. In the Late Classic (c. 600–900), imagery linked to the <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballgame">Mesoamerican ballgame</a> was introduced, once again displaying influence from central Mexico. By the <a href="Classic%20Maya%20collapse">Terminal Classic</a>, the institution of divine kingship declined, and Maya kings began to be depicted with their subordinate lords. As the Classic Period came to an end, stelae ceased to be erected, with the last known examples being raised in 909–910.
The function of the Maya stela was central to the <a href="ideology">ideology</a> of <a href="Maya%20rulers">Maya kingship</a> from the very beginning of the Classic Period through to the very end of the Terminal Classic (800–900). The <a href="hieroglyph">hieroglyph</a>ic inscriptions on the stelae of the Classic period site of <a href="Piedras%20Negras%20%28Maya%20site%29">Piedras Negras</a> played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with key dates being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories. From these stelae, <a href="Epigraphy">epigrapher</a> <a href="Tatiana%20Proskouriakoff">Tatiana Proskouriakoff</a> was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates, rather than <a href="Maya%20priesthood">priests</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Maya%20gods%20and%20supernatural%20beings">gods</a> as had previously been theorised.
Epigrapher <a href="David%20Stuart%20%28Mayanist%29">David Stuart</a> first proposed that the Maya regarded their stelae as "te tun", "stone trees", although he later revised his reading to "lakamtun", meaning "banner stone", from "lakam" meaning "banner" in several <a href="Mayan%20languages">Mayan languages</a> and "tun" meaning "stone". According to Stuart this may refer to the stelae as stone versions of vertical standards that once stood in prominent places in Maya city centres, as depicted in ancient Maya <a href="Graffito%20%28archaeology%29">graffiti</a>. The name of the modern <a href="Lacandon%20people">Lacandon</a> Maya is likely to be a <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Colonial</a> corruption of this word.

Maya stelae were often arranged to impress the viewer, forming lines or other arrangements within the ceremonial centre of the city. Maya cities with a history of <a href="sculpture">stonecarving</a> that extended back into the Early Classic preferred to pair their stelae with a circular altar, which may have represented a cut tree trunk and have been used to perform <a href="Human%20sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture">human sacrifice</a>, given the prevalence of sacrificial imagery on such monuments. An alternative interpretation of these "altars" is that they were in fact thrones that were used by rulers during ceremonial events. Archaeologists believe that they probably also served as ritual pedestals for <a href="censer">incense burners</a>, ceremonial fires and other offerings.

The core purpose of a stela was to glorify the king. Many Maya stelae depict only the king of the city, and describe his actions with <a href="Maya%20script">hieroglyphic script</a>. Even when the individual depicted is not the king himself, the text or scene usually relates the subject to the king. Openly declaring the importance and power of the king to the community, the stela portrayed his wealth, prestige and ancestry, and depicted him wielding the symbols of military and divine power. Stelae were raised to commemorate important events, especially at the end of a "<a href="k%CA%BCatun">kʼatun</a>" 20-year cycle of the <a href="Mesoamerican%20Long%20Count%20calendar">Maya calendar</a>, or to mark a quarter or a half "kʼatun". The stela did not just mark off a period of time; it has been argued that it physically embodied that period of time. The hieroglyphic texts on the stelae describe how some of the calendrical ceremonies required the king to perform ritual <a href="Maya%20dance">dance</a> and <a href="Bloodletting%20in%20Mesoamerica">bloodletting</a>. At <a href="Tikal">Tikal</a>, the <a href="Twin%20pyramid%20complex">twin pyramid groups</a> were built to celebrate the "kʼatun" ending and reflected <a href="Maya%20religion%23Cosmology">Maya cosmology</a>. These groups possessed <a href="Mesoamerican%20pyramids">pyramids</a> on the east and west sides that represented the birth and death of the sun. On the south side, a nine-doored building was situated in order to represent the <a href="Xibalba">underworld</a>. On the north side was a walled enclosure that represented the celestial region; it was left open to the sky. It was in this celestial enclosure that a stela-altar pair was placed, the altar being a fitting throne for the divine king. Calakmul practised a tradition that was unusual in the Maya area, that of raising twin stelae depicting both the king and his wife.

The <a href="iconography">iconography</a> of stelae remained reasonably stable during the Classic Period, since the effectiveness of the propaganda message of the monument relied upon its symbolism being clearly recognisable to the viewer. However, at times a shift in the sociopolitical climate induced a change in iconography. Stelae were an ideal format for public propaganda since, unlike earlier <a href="Maya%20architecture">architectural</a> sculpture, they were personalised to a specific king, could be arranged in public spaces and were portable, allowing them to be moved and reset in a new location. An important feature of stelae was that they were able to survive different phases of architectural construction, unlike architectural sculpture itself. With the ability to portray an identifiable ruler bearing elite goods, accompanied by hieroglyphic text and carrying out actions in service of the kingdom, stelae became one of the most effective ways of delivering public propaganda in the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Maya lowlands</a>. In 7th-century <a href="Cop%C3%A1n">Copán</a>, king <a href="Chan%20Imix%20K%CA%BCawiil">Chan Imix Kʼawiil</a> raised a series of seven stelae that marked the boundary of the most fertile land in the Copán valley, an area of approximately . As well as marking the boundary, they defined the sacred geometry of the city and referred to important seats of deities in the ceremonial centre of the Copán.

Stelae were considered to be invested with holiness and, perhaps, even to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and were considered to be participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a <a href="k%CA%BCaltun%20binding%20ritual">"kʼaltun" binding ritual</a>, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied <a href="Maya%20textiles">cloth</a>. This ritual was closely tied to the "kʼatun"-ending calendrical ceremony. A "kʼaltun" ritual is depicted carved onto a <a href="peccary">peccary</a> skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable <a href="Maya%20religion">religious</a> importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern <a href="K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20people">Kʼicheʼ Maya</a> practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.

A stela was not just considered a neutral portrait, it was considered to be 'owned' by the subject, whether that subject was a person or a god. Stela 3 from El Zapote in Guatemala is a small monument dating from the Early Classic period, the front of the stela bears a portrait of the rain god <a href="Chaac">Yaxhal Chaak</a>, "Clear Water Chaak". The accompanying text describes how the deity Yaxhal Chaak himself was dedicated, not just his image on the stela. This could be taken to imply that the stela was seen as the embodiment of the deity and is also true of those stelae bearing royal portraits, which were seen to be the supernatural embodiment of the ruler they represented. The stela, combined with any accompanying altar, was a perpetual enactment of royal ceremony in stone. David Stuart has stated that stelae "do not simply commemorate past events and royal ceremonies but serve to perpetuate the ritual act into eternity", thus ascribing a magical effectiveness to stela depictions. In the same vein, stelae bearing royal portraits may have been magically loaded extensions of the royal person ("uba" 'his self'), extremely powerful confirmations of political and religious authority. Stelae bearing images of multiple people, for instance of several nobles performing a ritual or of a king with his <a href="Maya%20warfare">war</a> captives, were likely to be exceptions to this idea of the stela as sacred embodiment of the subject.

At times, when a new king came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and replaced with new ones, or they might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One of the most striking archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of <a href="El%20Mirador">El Mirador</a>, where most of the stelae were found smashed.

Royal artisans were sometimes responsible for sculpting stelae; in some cases these sculptors were actually the sons of kings. In other cases it is likely that captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat. This appears to have been the case in Piedras Negras where Stela 12 depicting war captives submitting to the victorious king is carved in the style of <a href="Pomon%C3%A1">Pomoná</a>, the defeated city. Archaeologists believe that this may also have been the case with <a href="Quirigu%C3%A1">Quiriguá</a> after its surprise defeat of its overlord Copán.

Stelae were usually crafted from quarried <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, although in the <a href="Southern%20Maya%20area">Southern Maya area</a> other types of stone were preferred. Volcanic <a href="tuff">tuff</a> was used at Copán to craft their stelae in three dimensions. Both limestone and tuff were easily worked when first quarried and hardened with exposure to the elements. At Quiriguá a hard red <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> was used that was unable to reproduce the three-dimensionality of Copán but was of sufficient strength that the kings of the city were able to raise the tallest free-standing stone monuments in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. The Maya lacked beasts of burden and did not employ the wheel; therefore the freshly quarried blocks of stone had to be transported on rollers along the <a href="Sacbe">Maya causeways</a>. Evidence of this has been found on the causeways themselves, where rollers have been recovered. The blocks were sculpted to their final form while still soft and they then hardened naturally with time. Stone was usually quarried locally but was occasionally transported over great distances. <a href="Calakmul">Calakmul</a> in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> was one of two powerful cities that shaped the political landscape of the Classic Period, the other being Tikal. It imported black <a href="slate">slate</a> for one stela from the <a href="Maya%20Mountains">Maya Mountains</a>, more than away. Although Calakmul raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, they were sculpted from poor quality limestone and have suffered severe erosion, rendering most of them illegible. Stelae could be of substantial size; Quiriguá Stela E measures from the base to the top, including the buried portion holding it in place. This particular monument has a claim to being the largest free-standing stone monument in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> and weighs about . Stela 1 at <a href="Ixkun">Ixkun</a> is one of the tallest monuments in the <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">Petén Basin</a>, measuring high, not including the buried portion, and is roughly wide and thick.

Maya stelae were worked with stone chisels and probably with wooden mallets. <a href="Hammerstone">Hammerstone</a>s were fashioned from <a href="flint">flint</a> and <a href="basalt">basalt</a> and were used for shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels. Originally most were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s. At Copán and some other Maya cities, some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments.

Generally all sides of a stela were sculpted with human figures and hieroglyphic text, with each side forming a part of a single composition. Undecorated stelae in the form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found throughout the Maya region. These appear never to have been painted or to have been decorated with overlaid <a href="stucco">stucco</a> sculpture.

The Maya sculptural tradition that produced the stelae emerged fully formed and had probably been preceded by sculpted wooden monuments. However the tradition of raising stelae had its origin elsewhere in Mesoamerica, among the <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a>s of the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20Mexico">Gulf Coast of Mexico</a>. In the Late <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology%23Preclassic%20Era%20or%20Formative%20Period">Preclassic</a> it then spread into the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> and southwards along the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Coast</a> to sites such as <a href="Chiapa%20de%20Corzo%20%28Mesoamerican%20site%29">Chiapa de Corzo</a>, <a href="Izapa">Izapa</a> and <a href="Takalik%20Abaj">Takalik Abaj</a> where <a href="Mesoamerican%20Long%20Count%20calendar">Mesoamerican Long Count calendar</a> dates began to be carved onto the stelae. Although at Izapa the stelae depicted mythological scenes, at Takalik Abaj they began to show rulers in Early Classic Maya posture accompanied by calendrical dates and hieroglyphic texts. It was also at Takalik Abaj and Izapa that these stelae began to be paired with circular altars. By approximately 400 BC, near the end of the Middle Preclassic Period, early Maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule. At <a href="El%20Port%C3%B3n">El Portón</a> in the <a href="Salam%C3%A1">Salamá</a> Valley of <a href="Guatemalan%20Highlands">highland Guatemala</a> a carved <a href="schist">schist</a> stela (Monument 1) was erected, the badly eroded <a href="hieroglyph">hieroglyph</a>s appear to be a very early form of Maya writing and may even be the earliest known example of Maya script. It was associated with a plain altar in a typical stela-altar pairing that would become common across the Maya area. <a href="Kaminaljuyu%20Stela%2011">Stela 11</a> from Kaminaljuyu, a major Preclassic highland city, dates to the Middle Preclassic and is the earliest stela to depict a standing ruler. The sculpted Preclassic stelae from Kaminaljuyu and other cities in the region, such as <a href="Chalchuapa">Chalchuapa</a> in <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a> and <a href="Chocol%C3%A1">Chocolá</a> in the Pacific lowlands, tend to depict <a href="Maya%20politics">political</a> succession, <a href="Sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture">sacrifice</a> and <a href="Maya%20warfare">warfare</a>.

These early stelae depicted rulers as warriors or wearing the masks and headdresses of <a href="List%20of%20Maya%20gods%20and%20supernatural%20beings">Maya deities</a>, accompanied by texts that recorded dates and achievements during their reigns, as well as recording their relationships with their ancestors. Stelae came to be displayed in large ceremonial plazas designed to display these monuments to maximum effect. The raising of stelae spread from the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands throughout the Maya area. The development of Maya stelae coincides with the development of <a href="Imperial%20cult">divine kingship</a> among the Classic Maya. In the southern Maya area, the Late Preclassic stelae impressed upon the viewer the achievements of the king and his right to rule, thus reinforcing both his political and religious power.
At the Middle Preclassic city of <a href="Nakbe">Nakbe</a> in the central lowlands, Maya sculptors were producing some of the earliest lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals. Nakbe Stela 1 has been dated to around 400 BC. It was broken into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the myth of the <a href="Maya%20Hero%20Twins">Maya Hero Twins</a>, and would be the earliest known presentation of them. Around 200 BC the enormous nearby city of <a href="El%20Mirador">El Mirador</a> had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable. Stela dating to the Late Preclassic period are also known from the sites of El Tintal, Cival, and San Bartolo in Guatemala, and Actuncan and Cahal Pech in Belize.

On the Pacific Coast <a href="El%20Ba%C3%BAl">El Baúl</a> Stela 1 features a date in its hieroglyphic text that equates to 36 AD. It depicts a ruler bearing a sceptre or a spear with a double column of hieroglyphic text before him. At Takalik Abaj are two stelae (Stela 2 and Stela 5) depicting the transfer of power from one ruler to another; they both show two elaborately dressed figures facing each other with a column of hieroglyphic text between them. The Long Count date on Stela 2 dates it to the 1st century BC at the latest, while Stela 5 has two dates, the latest of which is 126 AD. The stela was associated with the burial of a <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> and other offerings. Stela 13 at Takalik Abaj also dates to the Late Preclassic; a massive offering of more than 600 <a href="Maya%20ceramics">ceramic</a> vessels was found at its base, together with 33 <a href="Obsidian%20use%20in%20Mesoamerica">obsidian</a> <a href="prismatic%20blade">prismatic blade</a>s and other <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artefacts</a>. Both the stela and the offering were associated with a nearby Late Preclassic <a href="Takalik%20Abaj%23Royal%20burials">royal tomb</a>. At <a href="Cuello">Cuello</a> in Belize, a plain stela was raised around 100 AD in an open plaza.

At the very end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the highlands and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the <a href="Lake%20Ilopango">Ilopango Volcano</a> that severely affected the entire region.

In the central <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">Petén</a> lowlands, the rise of individual rule at cities like Tikal required the development of new forms of public imagery. Preclassic imagery had involved largely anonymous, impersonal sculpture as an <a href="Maya%20architecture">architectural</a> element. The existing Preclassic Petén styles of architectural sculpture were combined with features of the highland and Pacific Coast tradition to produce the Early Classic Maya stela. Features formerly found on architectural sculpture, such as the giant masks adorning Preclassic pyramids, were adapted for use on stelae. For example, the so-called "<a href="Maya%20Jester%20God">Jester God</a>" was transferred to the headdress of the ruler portrayed on Tikal Stela 29, which bears the oldest Long Count date yet found in the Maya lowlands – equating to 292 AD. At some Maya cities the first appearance of stelae corresponded with the foundation of <a href="Dynasty">dynastic rule</a>.

The standard form of the Maya stela incorporating art, calendrical dates and hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only began to be erected in the Maya lowlands after 250 AD. The late 4th century saw the introduction of non-Maya imagery linked to the giant metropolis of <a href="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> in the <a href="Valley%20of%20Mexico">Valley of Mexico</a>. This foreign influence is seen at Tikal, <a href="Uaxactun">Uaxactun</a>, <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Azul">Río Azul</a> and <a href="El%20Zapote">El Zapote</a>, all in the <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Department">Petén Department</a> of Guatemala. At Tikal this was initiated by the king <a href="Yax%20Nuun%20Ayiin%20I">Yax Nuun Ayiin I</a>, from there it spread to his vassal cities. In the 5th century, this strongly Teotihuacan-linked imagery was abandoned by Yax Nuun Ayiin I's son <a href="Siyaj%20Chan%20K%27awiil%20II">Siyaj Chan Kʼawiil II</a>, who reintroduced imagery associated with the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands. Minor references to Teotihuacan continued, for example in the form of Teotihuacan war emblems. His Stela 31 was originally erected in 445 but was later broken from its butt and was found buried in the city centre, almost directly above his tomb. It depicts the crowning of Siyaj Chan Kʼawiil II, with his father hovering above him as a supernatural being and is executed in traditional Maya style. On the sides of the stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non-Maya style, dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior, bearing the central Mexican <a href="atlatl">atlatl</a> spear-thrower not adopted by the Maya, and carrying a shield adorned with the face of the Mexican god Tlaloc. The reverse of the stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing the history of Tikal, including the <a href="Tikal%23Tikal%20and%20Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan invasion</a> that established Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his dynasty.

In the Early Classic period the Maya kings began to dedicate a new stela, or other monument, to mark the end of each "kʼatun" cycle (representing 7,200 days, just under 20 <a href="sidereal%20year">sidereal year</a>s). At Tikal, the first to do so was king <a href="Kan%20Chitam">Kan Chitam</a> who ruled in the late 5th century. Stela 9 from the city is the first dated monument raised to mark off a period of time, it was raised in 475.

In the Late Classic the sculpted images of rulers on stelae remained much the same as in the Early Classic, appearing in profile in the foreground and filling almost the entire available space, which is delimited by a frame. Imagery associated with the <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballgame">Mesoamerican ballgame</a> started to appear in the Maya lowlands in the Late Classic Period. Maya kings are depicted as warriors wearing costume from the Mexican highlands, including elements such as the foreign god <a href="Tlaloc">Tlaloc</a> and the <a href="Feathered%20Serpent%20%28deity%29">Teotihacan serpent</a>. Such imagery appears in the Late Classic on stelae from <a href="Naranjo">Naranjo</a>, <a href="Piedras%20Negras%20%28Maya%20site%29">Piedras Negras</a> and the <a href="Petexbat%C3%BAn">Petexbatún</a> cities of <a href="Dos%20Pilas">Dos Pilas</a> and <a href="Aguateca">Aguateca</a>. At Dos Pilas, a pair of stelae represent the king of the city in costume forming a <a href="Jaguars%20in%20Mesoamerican%20culture">jaguar</a> and eagle pairing, characteristic of the Mexican warrior cult. Stelae were being erected by the Maya across the entire central and southern Maya lowlands by 790, an area that encompassed .

In the north, <a href="Coba">Coba</a> on the eastern side of the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> raised at least 23 large stelae. Although badly eroded their style and texts link them to cities from the Petén Basin. At the southern periphery of the Maya region, Copán developed a new high-<a href="relief">relief</a> style of stelae and in 652 the twelfth king <a href="Chan%20Imix%20K%CA%BCawiil">Chan Imix Kʼawiil</a> arranged a series of these stelae to define the sacred geometry of the city, and to celebrate his royal rule and his ancestors. His son and successor <a href="Uaxaclajuun%20Ub%CA%BCaah%20K%CA%BCawiil">Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil</a> further developed this new high-relief style of sculpture and erected a series of intricately decorated stelae in the city's Great Plaza that brought the carving of stelae close to full in-the-round three-dimensional sculpture. Both of these kings focused on their own images on their stelae and emphasised their place in the dynastic sequence to justify their rule, possibly linked to a break in the dynastic sequence with the death of the eleventh king of Copán.

After <a href="Quirigu%C3%A1">Quiriguá</a> defeated its overlord Copán in 738, it brought massive blocks of red sandstone from quarries from the city and sculpted a series of enormous stelae that were the biggest <a href="Monolithic%20column">monolithic monuments</a> ever raised by the Maya. Stela E stands over high and weighs more than 60 tons. These stelae were shaped into a square cross-section and were decorated on all four faces. These stelae usually bear two images of the Quiriguá king, on the front and the back, in a lower relief than that found at Copán. They feature highly complex panels of hieroglyphic text that are among the most skillfully executed of all Maya inscriptions in stone. The stelae have weathered well and display fine precision on the part of the sculptors.

The decline in the erection of stelae is linked to the decline in the institution of divine kingship, which began in the Late Preclassic. Originally the stelae depicted the king with symbols of power, sometimes standing over defeated enemies and occasionally accompanied by his wives or his heir. By the Terminal Classic, kings were sharing stelae with subordinate lords, who also played a prominent role in the events depicted. This reflected a decentralisation of power and the bargaining between high-ranking nobles so that the king could maintain power, but led to a progressive weakening of the king's rule. As the position of the king became weaker and that of his vassals and subordinates became stronger, the latter began to erect their own stelae, a function that was formerly the exclusive preserve of the king himself. Some of these subordinates broke away to form their own petty states, but even this did not last and they also ceased to erect monuments.

In the <a href="Pasi%C3%B3n%20River">Pasión River</a> region of Petén, rulers began to be portrayed as ballplayers on stelae. <a href="Seibal">Seibal</a> was the first site in the region to depict its rulers thus. Seventeen stelae were erected at Seibal between 849 and 889, and show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, including a lord wearing the beaked mask of <a href="Ehecatl">Ehecatl</a>, the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style <a href="speech%20scroll">speech scroll</a> emerging from the mouth. Some of these have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at <a href="Cacaxtla">Cacaxtla</a>, a non-Maya site in the central <a href="Political%20divisions%20of%20Mexico">Mexican state</a> of <a href="Tlaxcala">Tlaxcala</a>. This hybrid style seems to indicate that the kings of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources. Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs. Stelae at <a href="Oxkintok">Oxkintok</a>, to the north in the <a href="Puuc">Puuc</a> region of the Yucatán Peninsula, divided the face of the stela into up to three levels, each of which contained a different scene, usually of a lone figure that could be either male or female. The representation of the human figure differed from the formal treatment in the south, and were simplified, coarse representations lacking individuality amongst sociopolitical and religious symbols.

As the <a href="Classic%20Maya%20collapse">Classic Maya collapse</a> swept across the Maya region, city after city ceased to erect stelae recording its dynastic achievements. At the important city of <a href="Calakmul">Calakmul</a>, two stelae were raised in 800 and three more in 810, but these were the last and the city fell into silence. At Oxkintok the last stela was raised in 859. Stela 11, dated to 869, was the last monument to ever be erected at the once great city of Tikal. The last known Maya stelae bearing a Long Count calendrical date are <a href="Tonin%C3%A1">Toniná</a> Monument 101, which was erected in 909 to mark the kʼatun ending that year, and Stela 6 from <a href="Itzimt%C3%A9">Itzimté</a>, dated to 910.

At Copán ritual offerings were deposited around the city's stelae until at least 1000, which may represent the offerings of a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors, or may be due to highland Maya still regarding the city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin. A small number of sculpted stelae once stood at <a href="Cerro%20Quiac">Cerro Quiac</a> in the Guatemalan Highlands, and are presumed to have been erected by <a href="Mam%20people">Mam Maya</a> in the 13th or 14th century. At <a href="Lamanai">Lamanai</a> in <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, Classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small <a href="Mesoamerican%20chronology%23Postclassic%20Era">Postclassic</a> platforms dating to the 15th or 16th century. At <a href="La%20Milpa%2C%20Belize%20%28Maya%20site%29">La Milpa</a>, also in Belize, at around the time of <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish contact</a> in the late 16th century a tiny remnant Maya population started to make offerings of Conquest-period pottery to stelae, perhaps in an effort to invoke the ancestors to help resist the <a href="Spanish%20people">Spanish</a> onslaught. A plain stela in Twin Pyramid Group R at Tikal was removed by the local inhabitants some time during the Postclassic; its accompanying altar was also moved but abandoned some distance from its original location. Some plain stelae were raised at <a href="Topoxt%C3%A9">Topoxté</a> in the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala in the Postclassic; these were perhaps covered in <a href="stucco">stucco</a> and painted. This may represent a revival of the "katun"-ending ceremonies that occurred in the Classic Period, and reflected ties with the northern Yucatán.
One of the earliest accounts of Maya stelae comes from <a href="Diego%20Garcia%20de%20Palacio">Diego Garcia de Palacio</a>, a Spanish colonial official who described six of the stelae at Copán in a letter to king <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> written in 1576. <a href="Juan%20Galindo">Juan Galindo</a>, governor of Petén, visited Copán in 1834 and noted the sculpted high-relief stelae there. Five years later, American diplomat <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Stephens">John Lloyd Stephens</a> and British artist <a href="Frederick%20Catherwood">Frederick Catherwood</a> arrived in war-torn Central America and set out for Copán, describing fifteen stelae in Stephens' "<a href="Incidents%20of%20Travel%20in%20Central%20America%2C%20Chiapas%20and%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatán</a>", published in 1841. Stephens and Catherwood noticed the presence of red pigment on some of the Copán stelae. Stephens unsuccessfully attempted to buy the ruins of Quiriguá, and purchased Copán for US$50 ($  in 2019) with the idea of shipping the stelae to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> for display in a new museum. In the event, he was prevented from shipping the monuments down the <a href="Cop%C3%A1n%20River">Copán River</a> by the discovery of impassable rapids and all the stelae remained at the site. While Stephens was engaged on business elsewhere, Catherwood carried out a brief investigation of the stelae at Quiriguá but found them very difficult to draw without a <a href="camera%20lucida">camera lucida</a> due to their great height. <a href="Ambrosio%20Tut">Ambrosio Tut</a>, governor of Petén, and colonel <a href="Modesto%20M%C3%A9ndez">Modesto Méndez</a>, the chief magistrate, visited the ruins of Tikal in 1848 accompanied by <a href="Eusebio%20Lara">Eusebio Lara</a>, who drew some of the monuments there. In 1852 Modesto Méndez went on to discover Stela 1 and Stela 5 at Ixkun. English explorer <a href="Alfred%20Maudslay">Alfred Maudslay</a> arrived at Quiriguá in 1881 and cleared the vegetation from the stelae, then travelled on to see the stelae at Copán. In the early 20th century, an expedition by the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution%20for%20Science">Carnegie Institution</a> led by American <a href="Mayanist">Mayanist</a> <a href="Sylvanus%20Morley">Sylvanus Morley</a> discovered a stela at Uaxactun. This period marked a change from the efforts of individual explorers to those of institutions that funded archaeological exploration, excavation and restoration.

Notable collections of stelae on public display include an impressive series of 8th-century monuments at Quiriguá and 21 stelae collected in the sculpture museum at Tikal National Park, both of which are <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s in Guatemala. Calakmul, in Mexico, is another World Heritage site that also includes many stelae regarded as outstanding examples of <a href="Maya%20art">Maya art</a>. Copán in Honduras, also a World Heritage Site, possesses over 10 finely carved stelae in the site core alone.

The "<a href="Museo%20Nacional%20de%20Arqueolog%C3%ADa%20y%20Etnolog%C3%ADa">Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología</a>" ("National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology") in <a href="Guatemala%20City">Guatemala City</a> displays a number of fine stelae, including three 9th-century stelae from <a href="Machaquila">Machaquilá</a>, an 8th-century stela from <a href="Naranjo">Naranjo</a> and other stelae from <a href="Ixtutz">Ixtutz</a>, <a href="Kaminaljuyu">Kaminaljuyu</a>, <a href="La%20Amelia">La Amelia</a>, Piedras Negras, Seibal, Tikal, Uaxactun and <a href="Ucanal">Ucanal</a>. The "<a href="Museo%20Nacional%20de%20Antropolog%C3%ADa">Museo Nacional de Antropología</a>" ("National Museum of Anthropology") in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> has a small number of Maya stelae on display. The <a href="San%20Diego%20Museum%20of%20Man">San Diego Museum of Man</a> in <a href="California">California</a> contains replicas of the stelae from Quiriguá that were made in 1915 for the <a href="Pacific-California%20Exhibition">Pacific-California Exhibition</a>.

Many <a href="List%20of%20Maya%20sites">Maya archaeological sites</a> have stelae on display in their original locations, in Guatemala these include, but are not limited to, <a href="Aguateca">Aguateca</a>, <a href="Dos%20Pilas">Dos Pilas</a>, <a href="El%20Chal">El Chal</a>, <a href="Ixkun">Ixkun</a>, <a href="Nakum">Nakum</a>, Seibal, Takalik Abaj, Uaxactun, and <a href="Yaxha">Yaxha</a>. In Mexico, stelae may be seen at <a href="Yaxchilan">Yaxchilan</a>, and the site museum at Toniná.

Stelae have become threatened in modern times by plundering for sale on the <a href="international%20art%20market">international art market</a>. Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, chisels, acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions on the sides of the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by <a href="List%20of%20museums%20in%20the%20United%20States">American museums</a> and private collectors in the past. When such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical meaning is lost. Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen <a href="Pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian</a> sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date. In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an export license. <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.

In 1972, the initially well preserved Stela 5 at Ixkun was smashed into pieces by looters, who heated it until it shattered and then stole various pieces. A number of remaining fragments of the monument were rescued by archaeologist <a href="Ian%20Graham">Ian Graham</a> and transferred to the mayor's office in <a href="Dolores%2C%20El%20Pet%C3%A9n">Dolores</a>, Petén, where they were eventually used as construction material before once again being recovered, this time by the <a href="Atlas%20Arqueol%C3%B3gico%20de%20Guatemala">Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala</a> in 1989, and moved to their archaeological laboratory. At the nearby site of <a href="Ixtonton">Ixtonton</a>, from Ixkun, most of the stelae were robbed before the site's existence was reported to the Guatemalan authorities. By the time archaeologists visited the site in 1985 only 2 stelae remained.

In 1974, a dealer in pre-Columbian artefacts by the name of Hollinshead arranged for the illegal removal of Machaquilá Stela 2 from the Guatemalan jungle. He and his co-conspirators were prosecuted in the United States under the <a href="National%20Stolen%20Property%20Act%20of%201934">National Stolen Property Act</a> and they were the first people to be convicted under this act with reference to <a href="national%20patrimony">national patrimony</a> laws. The act states:
"whoever transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods ... of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the
same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud... [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both... "[w]hoever receives, possesses, conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of any goods .. . which have crossed a State or United States boundary after being stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken, knowing the same to have been stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken (is subject to fine or imprisonment)."

The act was originally intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that the National Stolen Property Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable in the case of stolen <a href="Cultural%20heritage">cultural property</a>.

Under <a href="Guatemalan%20legal%20system">Guatemalan law</a>, Maya stelae and other archaeological artefacts are property of the <a href="Politics%20of%20Guatemala">Guatemalan government</a> and may not be removed from the country without its permission. In the case of Machaquilá Stela 2, the monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal was easy to prove. The stela itself was cut into pieces, with the face being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, where it was packed into boxes and shipped to California. There it was seized by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> after being offered for sale to various institutions. The stolen portion of the stela was returned to Guatemala and is now in storage at the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.

Looting has been linked to the economic and political stability of the possessing nation, with levels of looting increasing during times of crisis. It also appears that art collectors have stelae, or portions of them, stolen to order by browsing archaeological books and catalogues for desirable pieces. Examples of this may be found at <a href="Aguateca">Aguateca</a> and <a href="El%20Per%C3%BA%20%28Maya%20site%29">El Perú</a>, both in Guatemala's <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Department">Petén department</a>, where only the better preserved hieroglyphs and human faces were cut away.

Dredd

Dredd is a 2012 <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction</a> <a href="action%20film">action film</a> directed by <a href="Pete%20Travis">Pete Travis</a> and written and produced by <a href="Alex%20Garland">Alex Garland</a>. It is based on the "<a href="2000%20AD%20%28comics%29">2000 AD</a>" comic strip "<a href="Judge%20Dredd">Judge Dredd</a>" and its eponymous character created by <a href="John%20Wagner">John Wagner</a> and <a href="Carlos%20Ezquerra">Carlos Ezquerra</a>. <a href="Karl%20Urban">Karl Urban</a> stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, <a href="dystopia">dystopic</a> metropolis called <a href="Mega-City%20One">Mega-City One</a> that lies in a <a href="Apocalyptic%20and%20post-apocalyptic%20fiction">post-apocalyptic</a> wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, <a href="Judge%20Anderson">Judge Anderson</a> (<a href="Olivia%20Thirlby">Olivia Thirlby</a>), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of <a href="apartment">flats</a> and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (<a href="Lena%20Headey">Lena Headey</a>).

Garland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new "Judge Dredd" film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film "<a href="Judge%20Dredd%20%28film%29">Judge Dredd</a>", was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio <a href="DNA%20Films">DNA Films</a>, "Dredd" began <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a>, using <a href="3D%20film">3D</a> cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on <a href="practical%20effect">practical</a> sets and locations in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> and <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>.

"Dredd" was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's <a href="visual%20effects">visual effects</a>, <a href="casting%20%28performing%20arts%29">casting</a> and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the <a href="satire">satirical</a> elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30–45 million. "Dredd" saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a <a href="cult%20film">cult film</a>. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by "2000 AD"s publisher <a href="Rebellion%20Developments">Rebellion Developments</a> have maintained the possibility of a second film.

The future United States is a dystopic irradiated wasteland known as the <a href="Cursed%20Earth">Cursed Earth</a>. On the east coast lies <a href="Mega-City%20One">Mega-City One</a>, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 serious crimes reported daily. The only force for order are the <a href="Judge%20%282000%20AD%29">Judges</a>, who act as judge, jury and executioner. <a href="Judge%20Dredd">Judge Dredd</a> is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit <a href="Judge%20Anderson">Cassandra Anderson</a>, a powerful psychic who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge.

In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as "Ma-Ma", executes three rogue drug dealers by having them <a href="flaying">skinned alive</a>, infused with Slo-Mo (an addictive new drug which reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' executions. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test to prevent the Judges from leaving or summoning help.

Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with <a href="rotary%20cannons">rotary cannons</a> that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. The Judges breach an outer wall and call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb to search for the Judges. When they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.

Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges <a href="Judge%20Volt">Volt</a> and <a href="Judge%20Guthrie">Guthrie</a> respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.

While Dredd works his way towards Ma-Ma, she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd encounters Chan and is suspicious that he does not ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's <a href="biometric%20device">DNA scanner</a> does not recognise him and explodes, taking his arm off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading her mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition. He is subsequently shot and injured by Lex, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.

Anderson and Dredd obtain the code to Ma-Ma's apartment from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that, in the case of her death, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.

In the aftermath, Anderson accepts that she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed, and leaves. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance; he responds that she has passed.


The cast also includes: <a href="Domhnall%20Gleeson">Domhnall Gleeson</a> as the gang's unnamed computer expert; Warrick Grier as Ma-Ma's right-hand man Caleb; <a href="Deobia%20Oparei">Deobia Oparei</a> as TJ, Peach Trees' medic; <a href="Francis%20Chouler">Francis Chouler</a> as <a href="Judge%20Guthrie">Judge Guthrie</a>, Daniel Hadebe as Judge Volt, and <a href="Rakie%20Ayola">Rakie Ayola</a> as the Chief Judge. <a href="Langley%20Kirkwood">Langley Kirkwood</a>, Edwin Perry, Karl Thaning, and Michele Levin portray, respectively, the corrupt Judges Lex, <a href="List%20of%20minor%20characters%20in%20Judge%20Dredd%23Alvarez">Alvarez</a>, Chan, and Kaplan. "Dredd" also features Junior Singo as Amos and Luke Tyler as Freel, young boys who confront Dredd; <a href="Jason%20Cope">Jason Cope</a> as Zwirner, the thug executed by Dredd during the opening scene; Joe Vaz as Big Joe, the thug that leads the confrontation outside of the med station; Scott Sparrow as Japhet, Anderson's first execution; and Nicole Bailey as Cathy, Japhet's wife, in whose apartment the Judges take refuge.

Development of the film was announced on 20 December 2008, although writer <a href="Alex%20Garland">Alex Garland</a> had begun working on the script in 2006. British studio <a href="DNA%20Films">DNA Films</a> produced the film, and partnered with sales agency <a href="IM%20Global">IM Global</a> to sell the worldwide distribution rights. By May 2010, this partnership saw IM Global and its owner <a href="Reliance%20Entertainment">Reliance Big Pictures</a> agree to co-finance the <a href="3D%20film">3-D</a> project with a $45 million production budget, and a schedule to begin filming in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, South Africa in late 2010. <a href="Pete%20Travis">Pete Travis</a> was named as the film's director and Garland, <a href="Andrew%20Macdonald%20%28producer%29">Andrew Macdonald</a> and Allon Reich would produce it. <a href="Duncan%20Jones">Duncan Jones</a> had previously been offered the role of director. In a 2010 interview, Jones said that his vision for the film was unconventional—describing it as weird, dark, and funny—and it did not mesh well with Garland's script. In September 2010, it was reported that the film would be titled "Dredd".

<a href="Pre-production">Pre-production</a> commenced on 23 August 2010 at Cape Town Film Studios in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa. During the 2010 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con International</a> in July, Urban confirmed that he had been offered the role of Judge Dredd, and on 18 August 2010, it was reported that Urban officially had the role. In September 2010, it was announced that Thirlby would play Dredd's telepathic rookie Cassandra Anderson. In the same month during the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>, the film attracted $30 million in worldwide pre-sales to distributors in 90% of theatrical markets. The sales included a $7 million deal with British distributor <a href="Entertainment%20Film%20Distributors">Entertainment Film Distributors</a>.

On 2 November 2010, <a href="Lions%20Gate%20Entertainment">Lions Gate Entertainment</a> secured the North American distribution rights to "Dredd". Headey joined the cast as drug-dealer Ma-Ma in January 2011. "Judge Dredd" creator <a href="John%20Wagner">John Wagner</a> acted as a consultant on the film. In 2012, he confirmed that it was a new adaptation of the comic material and was not a remake of the 1995 adaptation "<a href="Judge%20Dredd%20%28film%29">Judge Dredd</a>", which starred <a href="Sylvester%20Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>.

Garland began writing "Dredd" during post-production of his other writing credit "<a href="Sunshine%20%282007%20film%29">Sunshine</a>", and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of "<a href="28%20Weeks%20Later">28 Weeks Later</a>". Garland's draft revolved around one of Dredd's main enemies, the undead <a href="Judge%20Death">Judge Death</a>. He described the story as a "riff on the whole Judge system", but that it did not work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the "Judge Dredd" comic from the audience. He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme. From this script, Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded. He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines, including "<a href="Democracy%20%28Judge%20Dredd%20storyline%29">Democracy</a>" (1986) and "<a href="Origins%20%28Judge%20Dredd%20story%29">Origins</a>" (2006). He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter, day-in-the-life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega-City One. When developing the Judge Dredd character, Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic-book character, who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time. He said: "I didn't think Dredd could have a great epiphany, but there is definitely a change in him over the course of the movie. He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end. That's about as far as the shift goes." Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd's character stability.

Discussing the film's setting within the Peach Tree Block tower, Garland said the buildings were "like micro city states ... you could live and die in those buildings". He also considered that the setting met Wagner's suggestion that the future portrayed in "Dredd" should relate to modern ways of living. Garland named the tower after a restaurant called "The Peach Tree" in <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>, England, where he first met with Wagner. The budget limited his ability to represent some of the comic aspects of Mega-City One, such as robots and aliens. Throughout the production, Garland would send his script to Wagner, who would revise some of the dialogue. Urban would then further revise the script during his performance.

The filmmakers decided that Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like "someone who spends hours sort of <a href="anabolic%20steroid">steroiding</a> himself up." His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an extruded eagle statuette was removed from his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality and give it a sense of realism. Garland said: "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: "He is supposed to be the faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma ... You wouldn't get to the end of a <a href="Sergio%20Leone">Sergio Leone</a> Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant."

Dredd's signature weapon, the "<a href="Lawgiver%20%28Judge%20Dredd%29">Lawgiver</a>" was developed as a fully operational weapon based on a <a href="9%C3%9719mm%20Parabellum">9mm firing system</a>, capable of firing ammunition and being changed from automatic to semi-auto fire. His motorcycle "Lawmaster" was a modified 500cc motorcycle. A large <a href="motorcycle%20fairing">fairing</a> was added over the motorcycle with machine guns, an extended wheel base and the largest functional tyres possible. The vehicle was also operational and Urban insisted on riding it himself rather than relying on <a href="Chroma%20key">Chroma key</a> visual effects. Wagner described the necessity of adaptation from the source material and said that the 1995 film's attempt to directly replicate the comic's motorcycle was unable to steer because the tyres were too large.

Garland and VFX supervisor <a href="Jon%20Thum">Jon Thum</a> began developing the Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for "<a href="Never%20Let%20Me%20Go%20%282010%20film%29">Never Let Me Go</a>". They experimented with an effect to replicate the visual effects of <a href="hallucinogen">hallucinogen</a>ic drugs to see how long it could be used before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion. Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh. Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, "You see a whale or a shark breach the water ... then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by ... how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [drug] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time." He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: "Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete." Comic artist <a href="Jock%20%28artist%29">Jock</a> provided concept art for the film design.

With a $45 million production budget, filming began on 12 November 2010 in Cape Town and took approximately 13 weeks, with <a href="second%20unit">second unit</a> photography occurring over seven weeks. Filming locations included Johannesburg and Cape Town Film Studios ("Dredd" was the first project filmed at the studio). The project involved a majority of Cape Town crew members and about 40 imported crew. The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America, and government incentives that offered to rebate up to 25% of the production costs. The film was shot <a href="digital%20cinematography">digitally</a> and primarily in 3D using <a href="Red%20Digital%20Cinema%20Camera%20Company">RED MX</a>, SI2K and Phantom Flex high-speed cameras for the Slo-Mo sequences, producing 4,000 frames per second. Multiple camera rigs were used. Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production.

DNA Films' co-founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer <a href="Anthony%20Dod%20Mantle">Anthony Dod Mantle</a> to manage the shoot; it was the first time Mantle had worked with 3D. The filmmakers wanted "Dredd" to have a realistic, visceral look, and drew inspiration from crime and gangster films. For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting.

Mega-City One and its high rise towers were created in Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a suitable set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers did not want to build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing <a href="rotary%20cannon">rotary cannon</a>s across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: "I hope it will be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>" and "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28film%29">Clockwork Orange</a>"." Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.

The filmmakers experimented with the visuals of Mega-City One, including the design and positioning of the city's tower blocks, to create the impression that the city had risen out of the remains of another. They found that replicating the comic visuals of blocks close together made the blocks appear small. Instead they allowed more space between the buildings to emphasise the larger buildings and allow for the presence of roads and cars to allow for extrapolation outside of the picture. Outcrops and appendages were added to break up the buildings' straight lines. On 7 October 2011, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" reported that Travis was prohibited from participating in the editing process following creative disagreements between producers and executives. Garland took over the editing process; his contribution was considered significant enough for him to seek a co-director credit—a situation considered unusual as Garland had never directed a film before and had not been in charge of any filming. The disagreement concerned a disapproval over the footage that Travis was providing. Although Travis was removed from the editing process, he was monitoring the progress of the film. On 10 October, Travis and Garland released a joint statement claiming that they had agreed on an "unorthodox collaboration" before production began, that Travis was still involved in the film and that Garland was not seeking a co-director credit. In March 2018, Urban said that he believed "Dredd" should be considered Garland's directorial debut.

<a href="Paul%20Leonard-Morgan">Paul Leonard-Morgan</a> wrote the film's <a href="industrial%20music">industrial</a> music score. Leonard-Morgan created music to suit the film's futuristic setting. He experimented with band-based music, but decided it sounded over-produced and too safe. He turned to electronic music and used 1980s-style synthesisers and modern sound modules to create various combinations and applied distortion and other effects to the result. Leonard-Morgan said, "I was looking to create a timeless score which couldn't be placed in any particular era. So it's ended up being a cross between a modern dance track and evocative soundscapes." For scenes conveying the effect of the Slo-Mo narcotic, he composed new music with real instruments and then slowed the songs down by thousands of percent to match the visuals, such that one second of his composed score could last ten minutes. He then added additional real-time score to the slowed track.

An unofficially altered <a href="Justin%20Bieber">Justin Bieber</a> song served as inspiration for the Slo-Mo theme. Garland said that <a href="Portishead%20%28band%29">Portishead</a> instrumentalist <a href="Geoff%20Barrow">Geoff Barrow</a> "sent me a link to a Justin Bieber song slowed down 800 times and it became this stunning trippy choral music." Morgan recreated the effect based on the modified track, which was used in the finished film. The film used Bieber's music as a <a href="temp%20track">temporary placeholder</a> during editing before the score was finalised.

The film also features songs by artists including: "Poison Lips" by <a href="Vitalic">Vitalic</a>; "Dubstride" by Yann McCullough and Gemma Kicks; "Snuffbox" by <a href="Matt%20Berry">Matt Berry</a>; "Pontiac Moon" by Robert J. Walsh; and "Jubilee (Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around)" by <a href="Bobby%20Womack">Bobby Womack</a>.

In August 2012, the viral advertising site "Dredd Report" was launched, satirising the <a href="Drudge%20Report">Drudge Report</a>. The site featured a video condemning the use of Slo-Mo, and links to news about the film. A tie-in comic book was published; its plot serves as a prequel to the film's narrative and follows Ma-Ma's life as a prostitute, controlled by her pimp Lester Grimes. Ma-Ma forms a relationship with Eric—the creator of Slo-Mo. Lester kills Eric for interfering with his business, Ma-Ma castrates Lester with her teeth in retaliation and Ma-Ma takes over the Slo-Mo operation. The comic was written by "<a href="Judge%20Dredd%20Megazine">Judge Dredd Megazine</a>" editor <a href="Matt%20Smith%20%28comics%20editor%29">Matt Smith</a>, drawn by "<a href="2000%20AD%20%28comics%29">2000 AD</a>" artist <a href="Henry%20Flint">Henry Flint</a> and was released on 5 September 2012. An exclusive film poster featuring artwork by Jock was released by Mondo to promote the film's appearance at the 2012 <a href="Fantastic%20Fest">Fantastic Fest</a> in September 2012.

"Dredd"s marketing campaign won a <a href="Golden%20Trailer%20Awards">Golden Trailer Award</a> for "Best Thriller TV Spot" for the trailer "Big Addicted", and received nominations for: "Best Action TV Spot", "Most Original TV Spot", "Best Graphics in a TV Spot", "Best Music TV Spot", and "Best Action Poster" and "Most Original Poster" for the "Dredd" motion poster. Reports indicate that <a href="Lionsgate%20Entertainment">Lionsgate</a> contributed $25 million to advertising and print costs.

Urban has criticised the film's marketing campaign, saying that the film had "zero audience awareness. Nobody knew the movie was being released. "Dredd" represents a failure in marketing, not filmmaking."
"Dredd" premiered at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con">San Diego Comic-Con</a> International on 11 July 2012. It was also screened at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a> on 6 September, and at the <a href="Fantastic%20Fest">Fantastic Fest</a> in late September. The film was first theatrically released on 7 September in the UK and on 21 September worldwide. A South African release followed on 28 September.

"Dredd" earned $27.6 million from markets outside of North America and $13.4 million from North America, for a total of $41 million. In the UK, "Dredd" grossed £1.05 million ($1.7 million) from 415 cinemas during its opening weekend. This made it the weekend's number-one film, the first film restricted to audiences over 18 years of age to do so since "<a href="Saw%203D">Saw 3D</a>" in 2010. In its second weekend, the film placed number five, earning £769,381. "Dredd" was primarily shown in 3D in the UK, and 2D screenings were notoriously limited as the distributor denied cinemas' requests for 2D prints; the decision was considered to have limited the film's audience where 2D was their preferred format. "Dredd" earned a total of $6.9 million in the UK.

In North America, pre-release tracking estimated that the film would gross between $8 and $10 million during its opening weekend based on its adult rating and the poor reputation of the 1995 adaptation. The film earned $2.2 million on its opening day and finished the weekend in sixth place, grossing $6.3 million from 2,506 cinemas—an average of $2,514 per cinema. The largest demographic of the opening weekend audience was over the age of 25 (69%) and male (75%). The film's North American run ended on 1 November 2012, after 42 days. Outside of the UK and North America, "Dredd" had its most successful total gross takings in China ($4.5 million), Russia ($4 million), and Australia ($2 million).

The film received positive reviews from critics. On <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> the film has a rating of 78%, based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Fueled by bombastic violence and impressive special effects, rooted in self-satire and deadpan humor, "Dredd 3D" does a remarkable job of capturing its source material's gritty spirit." On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "B" on a scale of A+ to F.

At its premiere screening at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, "Dredd" received positive reviews. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> awarded the film eight out of ten and said, ""Dredd" is a character study, primarily, one fuelled by violence and action, and we can't think of a better way to re-introduce this character to cinema audiences." <a href="Indiewire">Indiewire</a> said, "As Dredd, Urban either has a better character to play than [Sylvester Stallone] did, or simply has a better grasp on what makes him tick, but the actor continues to distinguish himself as a versatile performer who turns mimicry into emotional meaning." "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>"s Chris Hewitt scored the film three out of five stars, and said it gets the lead character "absolutely, incontrovertibly right" and that Urban's Dredd is "a deadpan delight—he doesn't grow as a person and he doesn't crack wise ... the movie generates its few laughs from his sheer intractability". Hewitt also called Thirlby's Anderson engaging and wrote that the film is "a solid, occasionally excellent take on [Judge Dredd], with Urban's chin particularly impressive." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"s Geoff Berkshire said the film is "Grim, gritty and ultra-violent", called Dredd a "badass of few words", and wrote that Urban "does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront." He also praised Thirlby for carrying the film's emotional story and said, "one of the film's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge's merciless duties and a psychic's compassionate understanding."

"<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s Darren Franich said that the film is a "darkly funny blood-soaked romp" and singled out Urban for his "credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-<a href="Clint%20Eastwood">[Clint] Eastwood</a> voice—and his chin." "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s Phelim O'Neill scored the film 4 stars out of 5 and praised Urban's performance, saying, "The essence of Dredd is that he is almost an anti-character—he doesn't change or learn—and Urban nails it in an ego-free performance". He also wrote, "In a world of compromised adaptations, "Dredd" is something of a triumph." The "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>"s Laura Sneddon noted that "Dredd" passed the <a href="Bechdel%20test">Bechdel test</a>, lacking in sexism or misogyny and positively portraying female characters who are no weaker, more sexualised or shown less than their male counterparts. Sneddon described Anderson as repeatedly shown to have power over men who underestimate her, while Ma-Ma displays more intelligence and sadism than any of her male gang members, and neither woman interacts with the other on the basis of their gender. "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>"s Stephen Dalton wrote that the "dark, ironic, very British humour of the original strip" was largely absent from the film and that "[t]he limited location, computer game-style plot and muted humour" of the film might disappoint some fans of the comic. Dalton also said that Urban's performance, while close to the comic, lacked something. Overall Dalton said, "[p]itched at the right level to please original fans, but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones, [Dredd] feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre."

Many US newspaper critics were less taken with the film. Mark Olsen of the "Los Angeles Times" called it "a clunk-headed action picture" that "simply becomes a monotonous series of bad-guy confrontations." <a href="Frank%20Lovece">Frank Lovece</a> of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" described it as a "soullessly gritty" film, which apart from one believable scene involving Thirlby, is "all tough-guy talk and humorless cynicism". <a href="Kyle%20Smith">Kyle Smith</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>", who found the police tactics distasteful, wrote, "Justice is supposed to be blind, but in this case I think what the Law really wants is unaccountability" and called "Dredd" a "thudding, repetitive movie". He also wrote, "It’s not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyper-violence adds up to nothing". Stephen Whitty of "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">The Star-Ledger</a>" called it a "gray and ugly film", said that there was little to draw viewers in, and wrote that apart from the drug-induced slow-motion sequences, the film offers nothing new.

The visual effects and slow-motion sequences induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire said that they are notable and eye-catching with "impressively utilised 3D." Hewitt said the visuals were "genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that ... don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes to life in the Slo-mo scenes". Dalton said the film "constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like "<a href="District%209">District 9</a>" or "<a href="28%20Days%20Later">28 Days Later</a>" than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters." Dalton said, "[Mantle's] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences." "Dredd" won "The Art of 3D" award at the 2013 <a href="Empire%20Awards">Empire Awards</a>, and was nominated for "Best British Film" and "Best Science-fiction/Fantasy".

"Judge Dredd" creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of "Dredd". He said: "I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd ... Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than happy to see him in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson ... The character and storyline are pure Dredd." "Dredd" has been recognised as a <a href="cult%20film">cult film</a> since its release. Some reviewers drew comparisons between "Dredd" and "", another action film released a few months earlier, noting that similar elements in setting, story, and characters made "Dredd" appear derivative. However, Garland and Urban explained that the timing of when the films were shot would have made plagiarism impossible.

"Dredd" was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> and <a href="Digital%20distribution">Digital Download</a> on 8 January 2013 in North America, and 14 January in the UK. The Blu-ray edition contains the 2D and 3D versions of the film and a digital copy. The DVD and Blu-ray editions contain seven featurettes: "Mega-City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd", "Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of "Dredd" 3D", "Dredd", "Dredd's Gear", "The 3rd Dimension", "Welcome to Peachtrees", and a ""Dredd" Motion Comic Prequel" narrated by Urban. During its first week on sale in the UK, "Dredd" was the number 1 selling DVD and Blu-ray. During the week of its release in North America, it was the number 1 selling DVD and Blu-ray with approximately 650,000 units sold, and Blu-ray units accounting for nearly 50% of that figure. It was also the best-selling digital download for that period. Sales spiked in the United Kingdom in June 2013, following a reported rumour that it could influence DNA Films' decision to pursue a sequel. By September 2013, "Dredd" was estimated to have earned approximately $10 million in home media sales in North America, while in the UK it marked over 270 days in online-retailer <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a>'s top 100 selling home media. By July 2017, this sales figure was estimated to have increased to $20 million.

At the <a href="London%20Film%20and%20Comic%20Con">London Film and Comic Con</a> in July 2012, Garland said that a North American gross of over $50 million for "Dredd" would make sequels possible and that he had plans for a trilogy of films. A second film would focus on the origins of Dredd and Mega-City One, and a third would introduce Dredd's nemeses, the undead Judge Death and his <a href="Dark%20Judges">Dark Judges</a>. In August 2012, Garland said that a Judge Dredd television series would be a positive future step for the series. In September 2012, Garland said that he would explore the "Origins" and "Democracy" storylines, would introduce characters <a href="Judge%20Cal">Judge Cal</a> and <a href="Chopper%20%28Judge%20Dredd%20character%29">Chopper</a>, and would pursue the concept that Judge Dredd is a <a href="fascism">fascist</a>. That same month, Macdonald said that further films would be made in partnership with IM Global and would likely be shot in South Africa.

In March 2013, executive producer <a href="Adi%20Shankar">Adi Shankar</a> said that a sequel was unlikely. In May 2013, Urban said that a sequel was still possible, noting that the film had found an audience, and the response of fans could resurrect the project. "Dredd" fans on <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> launched a petition calling for a sequel. In July 2013, "2000 AD" endorsed the fan petition, supporting the campaign by printing advertisements in their publications, and by September 2013 it had attracted over 80,000 signatures. In April 2013, "2000 AD" released an image teasing a continuation of the film in comic book form with a release date scheduled for September 2013. The comic, titled "Dredd: Underbelly", was made available in "<a href="Judge%20Dredd%20Megazine">Judge Dredd Megazine</a>" #340 which was released on 18 September 2013. In October 2014, Shankar announced the production of an unofficial spinoff online series based on the Dark Judges that would be released later that month. The animated miniseries was titled "Judge Dredd: Superfiend" and all its six episodes were released on 27 October 2014 on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>. In March 2015, Garland said that a direct sequel would likely not happen in the near future, at least not with the crew involved in the original film.

In 2016, Urban said that "conversations are happening" regarding a "Dredd" continuation on streaming services <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> or <a href="Amazon%20Prime">Amazon Prime</a>. In an interview in May 2016, Urban said that while the film's "mishandled" marketing strategy and "unfortunate" box office performance meant that it was "problematic" to try to make a sequel, "the success it has achieved in all post-theatrical mediums has definitely strengthened the argument in favour of a sequel." In May 2017, a television series named "Judge Dredd: Mega-City One" was announced to be in development by IM Global Television and Rebellion. In August 2017, Urban stated he was in discussion to star in the series.

Adelaide leak

The Adelaide leak was the revelation to the press of a dressing-room incident during the <a href="Third%20Test%2C%201932%E2%80%9333%20Ashes%20series">third Test</a>, a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> match played during the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201932%E2%80%9333">1932–33 Ashes series between Australia and England</a>, more commonly known as the <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> series. During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> captain <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> was struck over the heart by a <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">ball delivered</a> by <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a>. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and <a href="Dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismissed</a> shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by the managers of the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) team, <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a> and <a href="Richard%20Palairet">Richard Palairet</a>. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. He said he did not want to speak to the Englishman owing to the <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter became public knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time, and the players were horrified that the confrontation became public knowledge.

In the immediate aftermath, many people assumed <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief may have affected the course of his subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued for the rest of their lives. Woodfull's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.

In 1932–33 the English team, led by <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a> and jointly managed by <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a> and <a href="Richard%20Palairet">Richard Palairet</a>, toured Australia and won <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> in an acrimonious contest that became known as the <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> series. The English team used contentious bowling tactics where the English <a href="Fast%20bowling">pace bowlers</a> <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a>, <a href="Bill%20Voce">Bill Voce</a> and <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a> bowled the ball roughly on the line of <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23Part%20of%20the%20wicket">leg stump</a>. The <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">deliveries</a> were often <a href="Bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short-pitched</a>, designed to rise at the batsman's body, with four or five fielders close by on the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> waiting to catch deflections off the bat. Intended to be intimidating, the tactics proved difficult for batsmen to counter and were physically threatening. The primary target of Bodyline was <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series. Leading English cricketers and administrators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932–33, and looked for possible weaknesses in his batting technique.

Following Jardine's appointment as England captain in July 1932, he developed a plan based on his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring to one side of the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. In a meeting, he outlined his plan to Larwood and Voce, who tried out the tactic in the remainder of the season with mixed success. Both <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> fast bowlers were selected to tour, as was <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> bowler <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a> who had tried similar tactics at the end of the season. In one match, he bowled short at <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a>; in his capacity as cricket correspondent of "<a href="The%20Morning%20Post">The Morning Post</a>", Warner was highly critical of the Yorkshire bowlers and Bowes in particular. These remarks were seized upon by Australian opponents of Bodyline in the coming months. A fourth fast bowler, <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> amateur <a href="Gubby%20Allen">Gubby Allen</a>, was later added to the tour. The selection of this many pace bowlers was unusual at the time, drawing comment from Australian writers, including Bradman.

In Australia, while Jardine's unfriendly approach and superior manner caused some friction with the press and spectators, the early tour matches were uncontroversial and Larwood and Voce had a light workload in preparation for the Test series. The first signs of trouble came in the match against a representative "Australian XI" at near full strength, in which the bowlers first used Bodyline tactics. Under the captaincy of <a href="Bob%20Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a> (Jardine having rested from the match), the England attack bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed this was not pre-planned and he simply informed Jardine what had happened. The Bodyline tactics continued in the next match and several players, including <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, were hit. The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular. Some former Australian players joined the criticism, saying the tactics were ethically wrong. However, at this stage, not everyone was opposed, and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly. On the other hand, Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over Bodyline as the tour progressed. Warner hated Bodyline but would not speak out against it. He was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side, particularly after expressing sentiments at the start of the tour that cricket "has become a synonym for all that is true and honest. To say 'that is not cricket' implies something underhand, something not in keeping with the best ideals ... all who love it as players, as officials or spectators must be careful lest anything they do should do it harm."
Jardine's tactics were successful in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him. At the time, Bradman was in dispute with the Board of Control, who would not allow players to write in newspapers unless journalism was their full-time profession; Bradman, although not a journalist, had a contract to write for the Sydney "Sun". A particular irritation for Bradman was that Jack Fingleton, a full-time journalist, was allowed to write for the "Telegraph Pictorial", although he required permission from the Board to write about cricket. Bradman threatened to withdraw from the team unless the Board allowed him to write. Fingleton and Bradman were openly hostile towards each other. From their first meeting while playing together for <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>, they disliked each other. Fingleton, conscious that Bradman's self-possession and solitary nature made him unpopular with some teammates, kept his distance after a dressing room argument, while Bradman believed the more popular Fingleton had tried to turn the team against him. Later hostility arose from Bradman's public preference for <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a> as a batsman, which Fingleton believed cost him a place on the 1934 tour of England. Fingleton's writings on the Bodyline series further soured the relationship. Bradman believed some of the differences stemmed from religion; Fingleton was a Roman Catholic, Bradman an Anglican.

Bradman missed the first Test, worn out by constant cricket and the ongoing argument with the Board of Control. The English bowlers used Bodyline intermittently in the first match, to the crowd's vocal displeasure. Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> praised the English bowling. For the second Test, Bradman returned to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use Bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe Bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness. Meanwhile, Woodfull was being encouraged to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack, not least by members of his own side such as <a href="Vic%20Richardson">Vic Richardson</a>, but refused to consider doing so.

During the mid-afternoon of Saturday 14 January 1933, the second day of the Third Test, Woodfull and Fingleton opened the batting for Australia in the face of an England total of 341 before a record attendance of 50,962 people. Fingleton was caught by the wicketkeeper without scoring. The third over of the innings was bowled by Larwood with fielders still in orthodox positions. The fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull's head and the final ball, delivered short on the line of <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23Part%20of%20the%20wicket">middle stump</a>, struck Woodfull over the heart. The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest, bent over in pain. The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily. Jardine called to Larwood: "Well bowled, Harold!" Although the comment was aimed at unnerving Bradman, who was also batting at the time, Woodfull was appalled. Play resumed after a brief delay, once it was certain the Australian captain was fit to carry on, and since Larwood's over had ended, Woodfull did not have to face the bowling of Allen in the next over. However, when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again, play was halted once more when the fielders were moved into Bodyline positions, causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team. Subsequently, Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change, Larwood said that Jardine had done so. Many commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting, and the angry spectators became extremely volatile. Jardine, although writing that Woodfull could have <a href="Substitute%20%28cricket%29%23Retired%20hurt%20%28or%20not%20out%29">retired hurt</a> if he was unfit, later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment. It is likely Jardine wished to press home his team's advantage in the match, and the Bodyline field was usually employed at this stage of an innings.

Shortly afterwards, a delivery from Larwood knocked Woodfull's bat from his hands and the Australian captain seemed unsettled. Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having been struck by short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted for an hour and a half. When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal of protest. In later years, Woodfull's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965.

Warner learned from <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> <a href="Leo%20O%27Brien%20%28cricketer%29">Leo O'Brien</a> that Woodfull was badly injured. Later in the afternoon, while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian dressing room with the intention of enquiring about Woodfull's health. Accounts vary about what followed. According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton's later description, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, awaiting treatment from a doctor, although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect. <a href="Leo%20O%27Brien%20%28cricketer%29">Leo O'Brien</a> described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist, having showered. Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner recalled saying, "Apart from all that, we most sincerely hope you are not too badly hurt," to which Woodfull replied, "The bruise is coming out." Embarrassed and humiliated, Warner and Palairet turned and left. Fingleton noted that Woodfull spoke quietly and calmly, which increased the effectiveness of his words. He also pointed out that Warner prided himself on sportsmanship, so an accusation of <a href="wiktionary%3Anot%20cricket">"not playing cricket"</a> would have stung the Englishman. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.

According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), <a href="Alan%20Kippax">Alan Kippax</a>, and former Australian Test players <a href="Jack%20Ryder%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Ryder</a> and <a href="Ernie%20Jones%20%28Australian%20sportsman%29">Ernie Jones</a> were present when the incident took place, but most of the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where they would have been able to hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.

Later that afternoon, Warner related the incident to Jardine, who replied that he "couldn't care less". The England captain then locked the dressing room doors and told the team what Woodfull had said and warned them not to speak to anyone concerning the matter. Warner later wrote to his wife that Woodfull had made "a complete fool of himself" and had been "fanning the flames".

Sunday being a <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23R">rest day</a>, there was no play. On Monday, the exchange between Warner and Woodfull was reported in several newspapers along with the description of Woodfull's injury. Most headlines were variations on "Woodfull Protests", and the most extensive accounts were by <a href="Claude%20Corbett">Claude Corbett</a> in "The Sun" and "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Sydney%29">The Daily Telegraph</a>". He wrote in the "Telegraph" that the "fires which have been smouldering in the ranks of the Australian Test cricketers regarding the English shock attack suddenly burst into flames yesterday." Another newspaper, "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">The Advertiser</a>" of Adelaide, claimed several members of the Australian team had repeated the story.

The players and officials were horrified that a sensitive private exchange had been reported to the press. <a href="News%20leak">Leaks</a> to the press were practically unknown in 1933. David Frith notes that discretion and respect were highly prized and such a leak was "regarded as a moral offence of the first order." Woodfull made it clear that he severely disapproved of the leak, and later wrote that he "always expected cricketers to do the right thing by their team-mates." As the only full-time journalist in the Australian team, suspicion immediately fell on Fingleton, although as soon as the story was published, he told Woodfull he was not responsible. Warner offered Larwood a reward of one pound if he could dismiss Fingleton in the second innings; Larwood obliged by bowling him for a <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>.

Later, Warner issued a statement to the press that Woodfull had apologised for the incident and that "we are now the best of friends". Woodfull denied through Bill Jeanes, the Secretary of the Australian Board of Control, that he had expressed regret, but he had said there was no personal animosity between the two men.

Until he read Warner's "Cricket Between Two Wars" during the Second World War, Fingleton was unaware that Warner assumed he was responsible for the leak. When he found out, Fingleton wrote to Warner, who replied that although he believed Fingleton to be the source, he would publish a correction if presented with evidence to the contrary. Fingleton did not pursue the case. Australian cricketer <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> wrote that during the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">1948 tour of England</a>, he and Fingleton confronted Warner, who apologised as he no longer believed Fingleton to be the culprit. Fingleton thought the belief he was responsible cost him a place on the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201934">1934 tour to England</a>, although there were other possible factors in his exclusion. According to Fingleton, Woodfull later told him that the controversy had led to his missing selection. A letter which Woodfull wrote to Fingleton in 1943 stated "I can assure you that I did not connect your name with the passing on of that conversation."

In his 1978 biography of <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>, Fingleton accused Bradman of relating Woodfull's words to the press. Fingleton claimed that Claude Corbett revealed the information to him. In Fingleton's version of events, Bradman telephoned Corbett during the night to arrange a meeting. Bradman wrote for Corbett's paper, Sydney's "Sun". Sitting in Corbett's car, Bradman told the journalist about the Warner–Woodfull incident. Corbett considered the story too important to keep to himself, so shared it with other journalists. Fingleton later added that "Bradman would have saved me a lot of backlash ... had he admitted that he had given the leak. Part of his job was writing for the "Sydney Sun" and he had every right to leak such a vital story."

Bradman denied this version of events. In 1983, two years after Fingleton's death, a book written by Michael Page, with Bradman's close co-operation, blamed Fingleton for the leak and dismissed Fingleton's story concerning Bradman and Corbett as "an absurd fabrication", arising from a grudge against Bradman. The book pointed out that Fingleton only made the accusation after Corbett's death. Fingleton's <a href="executor">executor</a>, Malcolm Gemmell, summarised the evidence which supported Fingleton's accusation in a magazine article: that Bradman wrote for the "Sun", was the prime target of Bodyline, and had previously urged the Australian Board of Control to object to the tactic. Fingleton's brother supported the claim that Bradman was responsible, repeating in 1997 the alleged view of Corbett that Bradman provided the information. In 1995, Bradman was interviewed for television, and when asked about the source of the leak, responded sharply: "It wasn't me!" In the same year, a biography of Bradman, written with his close co-operation, by <a href="Roland%20Perry">Roland Perry</a>, said that Bradman had confronted Corbett to ask who leaked the story, to be told it was Fingleton.

O'Reilly believed that Bradman, with whom he did not get along, was responsible, wishing to expose the English bowling he believed was designed to cause him physical injury. He also said Bradman was an expert at diverting blame. Cricket writer <a href="Ray%20Robinson%20%28cricket%20writer%29">Ray Robinson</a> wrote that many of the Australian team did not blame Fingleton, and they knew who met Corbett. In the early 1980s another journalist, <a href="Michael%20Davie">Michael Davie</a>, interviewed Ponsford who said that Woodfull never forgave Bradman for "a couple of things". Davie suggests that one of these may have been leaking the Adelaide story.

Gilbert Mant, a journalist who covered the tour, investigated the leak in the mid-1990s. He died in 1997, but had arranged for a summary of his findings to be sent to David Frith with a request not to publish the information before Bradman died. Mant believed the leak was not a serious crime and pointed out that any of the players except Ponsford and Richardson, who were batting at the time Warner entered the dressing room, could have leaked the story. Bradman, in correspondence with Mant in 1992, continued to blame Fingleton and would never forgive the "dastardly lie he concocted about me" and hoped Mant could clear Bradman's name. As part of his investigations, Mant contacted Corbett's family. Corbett died in 1944, and his son Mac said he never mentioned the leak. However, his daughter Helen related that Corbett had spoken to his wife about the affair. She had told Helen that Corbett had received the information from Bradman. Mant believed that while Corbett may have played a joke on Fingleton in naming the culprit, he would not have done so with his wife.

Many commentators and cricketers deplored the use of Bodyline bowling. Some felt frustration that Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.

During the play on Monday, a short ball from Larwood fractured <a href="Bert%20Oldfield">Bert Oldfield</a>'s skull, although Bodyline tactics were not being used at the time. The Australian Board of Control contacted the MCC managers Warner and Palairet asking them to arrange for the team to cease the use of Bodyline, but they replied the captain was solely in charge of the playing side of the tour. On the Wednesday of the game, the Australian Board sent a <a href="Telegraphy">cable</a> to the MCC which stated "Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace the best interests of the game, making protection of the body by the batsman the main consideration. This is causing intensely bitter feeling between the players, as well as injury. In our opinion it is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once it is likely to upset the friendly relations existing between Australia and England." After England's victory in the match, Jardine went to the Australian dressing room but had the door closed in his face. Speaking to his team, Jardine offered to end the use of the tactics if the players opposed them, but they unanimously voted to continue. The report in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" stated it was probably the most unpleasant match ever played.

Jardine threatened to withdraw his team from the Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board retracted the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims about the danger of Bodyline and threatened to call off the tour. The series had become a major diplomatic incident by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The public in both England and Australia reacted with outrage towards the other nation. <a href="Alexander%20Hore-Ruthven%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gowrie">Alexander Hore-Ruthven</a>, the <a href="Governor%20of%20South%20Australia">Governor of South Australia</a>, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to <a href="James%20Henry%20Thomas">J. H. Thomas</a>, the British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Dominion%20Affairs">Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs</a> that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister <a href="Joseph%20Lyons">Joseph Lyons</a> met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour. However, correspondence continued for almost a year. Fingleton was dropped after scoring a <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23P">pair</a> in the third Test, and England won the final two matches to win the series 4–1.

Mothers of the Disappeared

"Mothers of the Disappeared" is a song by Irish <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="U2">U2</a>. It is the eleventh and final track on their 1987 album "<a href="The%20Joshua%20Tree">The Joshua Tree</a>". The song was inspired by lead singer <a href="Bono">Bono</a>'s experiences in <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> and <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a> in July 1986, following U2's participation in the <a href="A%20Conspiracy%20of%20Hope">Conspiracy of Hope</a> tour of <a href="benefit%20concert">benefit concert</a>s for <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>. He learned of the <a href="Mothers%20of%20the%20Plaza%20de%20Mayo">Madres de Plaza de Mayo</a>, a group of women whose children had <a href="forced%20disappearance">"forcibly disappeared"</a> at the hands of the <a href="National%20Reorganization%20Process">Argentine</a> and <a href="Military%20government%20of%20Chile%20%281973%E2%80%931990%29">Chilean dictatorships</a>. While in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>, he met members of <a href="COMADRES">COMADRES</a>, a similar organization whose children had been abducted by the government in El Salvador. Bono sympathized with the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to their cause. 

The song was written on a <a href="classical%20guitar">Spanish guitar</a>, and the melody lifted from a piece Bono composed in <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> in 1985 to help teach children basic forms of hygiene. The lyrics contain an implicit criticism of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan Administration</a>, which backed two South American regimes that seized power during <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coups d'état</a> and which provided financial support for the military regime in El Salvador. Thematically it has been interpreted as an examination of failures and contradictions in <a href="Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20United%20States">US foreign policy</a>. The drum beat provided by <a href="Larry%20Mullen%20Jr.">Larry Mullen Jr.</a> was processed through an <a href="effects%20unit">effects unit</a> that gave it a drone-like quality, which bassist <a href="Adam%20Clayton">Adam Clayton</a> described as "evocative of that sinister death squad darkness".

"Mothers of the Disappeared" was favourably received by critics, who variously described it as "powerful", "a moving tribute", and containing "stunning beauty and sadness". The song was played seven times on the 1987 <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20Tour">Joshua Tree Tour</a>, and some recordings were considered for the ending sequence of the 1988 film "<a href="Rattle%20and%20Hum">Rattle and Hum</a>". It was revived for four concerts on the 1998 <a href="PopMart%20Tour">PopMart Tour</a> in South America, and for two of them, the Madres joined the band onstage for the performance, one of which was broadcast on television in Chile. Bono used the opportunity to ask former Chilean dictator General <a href="Augusto%20Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a> to reveal to the Madres the locations of their children's bodies. The song was played a further three times on the <a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20Tour">U2 360° Tour</a>; one performance was dedicated to Fehmi Tosun, an ethnic Kurd who forcibly disappeared in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> in 1995. Bono re-recorded the song <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> in 1998 for the album "¡Ni Un Paso Atras!" ().

Recording sessions for "The Joshua Tree" began in January 1986 in <a href="Danesmoate%20House">Danesmoate House</a> in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>'s <a href="A%20Conspiracy%20of%20Hope">A Conspiracy of Hope</a> tour of <a href="benefit%20concert">benefit concert</a>s. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer <a href="Bono">Bono</a> met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the <a href="Augusto%20Pinochet">Pinochet</a>-led <a href="Military%20government%20of%20Chile%20%281973%E2%80%931990%29">regime</a> that seized power in 1973 during a <a href="1973%20Chilean%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the <a href="Mission%20District%2C%20San%20Francisco">Mission District</a> that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the <a href="Mothers%20of%20the%20Plaza%20de%20Mayo">Madres de Plaza de Mayo</a>, a group of women whose children were <a href="forced%20disappearances">forcibly disappeared</a> by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the <a href="Dirty%20War">Dirty War</a>, and the coup d'état that brought <a href="Jorge%20Rafael%20Videla">Jorge Rafael Videla</a> to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.

Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, traveling to <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> and <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a> with his wife, <a href="Ali%20Hewson">Alison Hewson</a>, to see first-hand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. While there, they worked with the Central American Mission Partners (CAMP), a human rights and economic development organization. In El Salvador they met members of the Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero (<a href="COMADRES">COMADRES</a>: Committee of the Mothers <a href="%C3%93scar%20Romero">Monsignor Romero</a>), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Salvadoran government during the <a href="Salvadoran%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> because they opposed the military regime that was in power. At one point during the trip, Bono, Alison, and a member of CAMP were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers. The shots were a warning and, according to author John Luerssen, the incident made Bono realize that "they didn't care for their intrusion and they could kill them if they felt compelled."

In 2006, Bono recounted another experience he had in El Salvador, where he had seen a body thrown from a van into the road. He remarked, "People would just disappear. If you were part of the opposition, you might find an SUV with the windows blacked out parked outside your house... If that didn't stop you, occasionally they would come in and take you and murder you; there would be no trial." Bono understood the cause of the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to it. His experiences in Central America inspired the lyrics of "Mothers of the Disappeared" and another track from "The Joshua Tree", "<a href="Bullet%20the%20Blue%20Sky">Bullet the Blue Sky</a>".

"Mothers of the Disappeared" was created and <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> at guitarist <a href="the%20Edge">the Edge</a>'s newly-bought home, Melbeach, which U2 used as a recording studio. Bono wrote the song on his mother-in-law's <a href="classical%20guitar">Spanish guitar</a>; the melody came from a song that Bono wrote in Ethiopia in 1985 to teach children about basic methods of hygiene. The drums, played by <a href="Larry%20Mullen%20Jr.">Larry Mullen Jr.</a>, were <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sampled</a> and <a href="Loop%20%28music%29">looped</a> from another song by producer <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> and subsequently slowed down and treated with "a canyon load of <a href="Reverberation">reverb</a>". The Edge added a guitar part using a <a href="Bond%20Electraglide">Bond Electraglide</a> guitar, which he abused to produce a sound that he liked. Producer <a href="Daniel%20Lanois">Daniel Lanois</a> was the principal mixer of the song. Bono, likening the studio itself to an instrument, described Lanois's mix as a "performance".

At the conclusion of the lyrics sheet for the song in the <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> of "The Joshua Tree", U2 listed addresses for several branches of Amnesty International, and proceeds from the song were donated to the organization. In 1998, Bono re-recorded the song <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> in English and Spanish for the album "¡Ni Un Paso Atras!" (), along with a recitation of the <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a> poem "<a href="The%20Winding%20Stair%20and%20Other%20Poems">The Mother of God</a>". The album was created by the Madres in commemoration of the disappearance of their children. The tracks were also recorded for the 1999 film "20 Años... 20 Poemas... 20 Artistas" ("20 Years... 20 Poems... 20 Artists").
"Mothers of the Disappeared" runs for 5:14 (5 minutes, 14 seconds). It is played in <a href="time%20signature">common time</a> in a <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="A%20major">A</a>. The song begins with the sound of rain hitting a roof, which fades in over the first fourteen seconds alongside the bass and a <a href="audio%20signal%20processing">processed</a> drum loop beat by Mullen which reverberates in the background. Thirty-two seconds into the song, Mullen's drums enter, playing a sporadic beat every four to five seconds. At the fifty-second mark the drums play a more regular beat, and the Edge's guitar, accompanied by Eno's <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>, enters. The first verse begins at 1:28, and introduces the chord progression of A–E–Fm–D–A, which is played in the verses. At 2:41 Eno's keyboards enter, and the song begins to follow a D–D–A chord progression, while Bono begins falsetto vocals. The second verse then begins at 3:01. The lyrics end at 3:37, and the song returns to the chord progression of D–D–A. The harmony gradually grows in volume until 4:33, at which point the song enters into a <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a>; the keyboards come to a finish and the guitar returns to playing A notes before fading over the next eight seconds alongside the bass. The synthesizer, drums, and drum loop conclude the song, fading out slowly over the last thirty-one seconds.

Eno used a piano as a percussive instrument and mixed the result with the drum loop through a <a href="Lexicon%20%28company%29">PCM70</a> <a href="effects%20unit">effects unit</a> to create a sound that bassist <a href="Adam%20Clayton">Adam Clayton</a> called "eerie and foreign and scary". Lanois stated that the processing of Mullen's beat, which resulted in a drone-like sound, became the song's backbone and personality. Clayton described it as "evocative of that sinister death squad darkness". Colm O'Hare of "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>" felt it was "the key sonic element" because it "[evokes] an abstract sense of evil and dread".

In December 1986, Bono stated that he had a love–hate relationship with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, "There's no question in my mind of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan Administration</a>'s involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." In 2007, Clayton noted "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> who was <a href="UK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984%E2%80%9385%29">breaking the miners</a>... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as <a href="the%20Clash">the Clash</a> but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." He said "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as "prehistoric", saying "it connects with something very primitive."

Greg Garrett, an English professor at <a href="Baylor%20University">Baylor University</a>, saw the song as an effort to "[respond] to growing interests in doing justice—and calling to attention American failures in that regard", noting that the regimes in South America had been supported by the United States because of their <a href="anti-communism">anti-communist</a> positions, even though their tactics were in opposition to the democratic values that "America claims to champion around the world". Lisa Hand of the "<a href="Sunday%20Independent%20%28Ireland%29">Sunday Independent</a>" noted the influence of America on the track, remarking, "[it] does not confine itself simply to the music, but also extends to some of the lyrics. However, far from being a tribute to the star-spangled banner, the words highlight the political untruths and ambiguities which exist within the U.S. 'Mothers of the Disappeared' and 'Bullet the Blue Sky' both take a hard look at the <a href="Latin%20America%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">American involvement</a> in South America". Richard Harrington of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" described the song as "a simple lament of great beauty and sadness pleading for the realization that ideological battles about right and left obscure the more important issue of right and wrong." Author David Kootnikoff described it as a "[portrait] of the American Dream gone rancid".

U2 debuted "Mothers of the Disappeared" on 14 April 1987 in San Diego, California, on the first leg of the <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20Tour">Joshua Tree Tour</a>, where it closed the concert in place of the band's long-time finale "<a href="40%20%28song%29">40</a>". It was performed three more times on the leg; twice to open the encore and once to conclude the main set. U2 revived the song seven months later on the third leg, playing it in the encore at three of the final four concerts on the tour.

The final two performances were held in Tempe, Arizona on 19 and 20 December 1987 and were filmed for the 1988 film "<a href="Rattle%20and%20Hum%23Film">Rattle and Hum</a>". U2 sang the refrain "el pueblo vencerá", which means "the people will overcome" in Spanish, at the conclusion of the song. Bono noted that the Madres use the phrase for motivation. The Edge said "we're so close to a Spanish speaking part of the world, we felt that maybe people at the concert might pick up on this lyric." Bono added that they had closed every concert since 1983 with the song "40", and so they were looking to replace it with "Mothers of the Disappeared" from that point on. He explained, "If the people of Arizona sing this, and if it goes into the film and onto the record, wherever we go in a way for the next few years, that will be taken up again. It'll be an interesting experiment ...". The footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film, but the band eventually decided against including it. "<a href="Pride%20%28In%20the%20Name%20of%20Love%29">Pride (In the Name of Love)</a>" was used as the final live song, and "<a href="All%20I%20Want%20Is%20You%20%28U2%20song%29">All I Want Is You</a>" was chosen to play over the credits.

Following the seven performances on the Joshua Tree Tour, U2 did not perform "Mothers of the Disappeared" until 1998, on the fourth leg of the <a href="PopMart%20Tour">PopMart Tour</a>. It was played at three concerts in Argentina and once in Chile, concluding all four shows. Bono sang "el pueblo vencerá" at the end of each performance. The first rendition was on 5 February 1998 in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, where it was performed with the Madres accompanying them onstage. The song was played by just Bono and the Edge and was set against footage of the Madres on the video screen. At the conclusion of the song, the band members faced the Madres and applauded, an act in which the rest of the audience joined. Part of the performance was later included on the television documentary "Classic Albums: The Joshua Tree".

The cost of the tickets was too high for many fans in South America, so the band broadcast the 11 February concert in Chile live on television. Knowing that many people in the country would be watching, they played "Mothers of the Disappeared" in place of "Wake Up Dead Man". The stadium in which the concert was held had been used as a prison camp by Pinochet's regime following the coup d'état. Again it was performed solely by Bono and the Edge against footage of the Madres, and they invited the women to join them onstage a second time. The Madres held up photographs of their children and spoke about them briefly during the performance, an act which received a mixed reception from the audience. Bono made a plea to Pinochet, asking him to "tell these women where are the bones of their children."

"Mothers of the Disappeared" was performed again on the fourth leg of the <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a>, on 26 February 2006 in Santiago and 2 March in Buenos Aires. Although it was rehearsed by the full band, it was played only by Bono and the Edge in an arrangement similar to the one from the PopMart Tour. The Edge performed the song on a <a href="charango">charango</a> that Chilean President <a href="Ricardo%20Lagos">Ricardo Lagos</a> had given to Bono earlier that day. It was played at three concerts on the third leg of the <a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20Tour">U2 360° Tour</a> in place of "<a href="MLK%20%28song%29">MLK</a>". One performance in Istanbul, Turkey was dedicated to Fehmi Tosun, an ethnic Kurd who was kidnapped in October 1995 and subsequently disappeared. The abduction was witnessed by his wife and daughter; no information regarding his disappearance has ever been released.
For the first time in 30 years, a full band arrangement of "Mothers of the Disappeared" returned to U2's live set for <a href="the%20Joshua%20Tree%20Tour%202017">the Joshua Tree Tour 2017</a>, on which the group played "The Joshua Tree" in sequence in its entirety for each show. <a href="Eddie%20Vedder">Eddie Vedder</a> and <a href="Mumford%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Mumford & Sons</a> accompanied U2 on-stage in a performance of the song during a 14 May 2017 show in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>.

"Mothers of the Disappeared" was favourably received by critics. Steve Morse of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" called the song "powerful" and described the backing vocals as tender and choirlike. Don McLeese of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" described it as a "hymn to human rights". Adrian Thrills of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" called it "a simple, plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness". Nicholas Jennings of "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" felt that it was "The Joshua Tree"s "most topical song". Music journalist <a href="Andrew%20Mueller">Andrew Mueller</a> felt the track was a "wilfully downbeat finale". In "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", Steve Pond said "'Mothers of the Disappeared' is built around desolate images of loss, but the setting is soothing and restorative—music of great sadness but also of unutterable compassion, acceptance and calm." Lennox Samuels of "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" stated that there was "an ineffable sadness in Bono's vocals and images where 'Night hangs like a prisoner / Stretched over black and blue' ", calling it "a moving tribute" to people around the world who had lost loved ones to warfare and conflict. He added "[w]hat's remarkable about the song is that despite the intrinsic pain, it remains eerily cleansing. Even in the midst of decay and excess and horror, Bono can find hope and absolution." In 2006 Bono described it as "a beautiful end to the album", saying, "That song means as much to me as any of the songs on that album, it's right up there for me," and noting that it is a song "I'm very proud of to this day."

Barbara Jaeger of "<a href="The%20Record%20%28Bergen%20County%29">The Bergen Record</a>" likened "Mothers of the Disappeared" to "<a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day%20%28U2%20song%29">New Year's Day</a>" and "Pride (In the Name of Love)", stating that the band used all three to "stir political consciousness and to urge social commitment." Thirteen years later, Ryan Jones, in his review of U2's 2000 album "<a href="All%20That%20You%20Can%27t%20Leave%20Behind">All That You Can't Leave Behind</a>" for the same publication, said the song "<a href="Peace%20on%20Earth%20%28U2%20song%29">Peace on Earth</a>" contained echoes of "Mothers of the Disappeared" in its lyrics and the tone of the instrumental prelude. In reviewing the group's 2009 album "<a href="No%20Line%20on%20the%20Horizon">No Line on the Horizon</a>", Mueller said the closing "Cedars of Lebanon" "maintains this essentially optimistic group's counter-intuitive tradition of ending their albums with rueful comedowns", likening it to "Mothers of the Disappeared". McLeese believed that the song had its roots in "the folklike purity of traditional Irish music". According to Luerssen the song is "notorious" in Central and South America, and it is often "played as an act of defiance" by the Madres. Art for Amnesty cited the song, and the effect it had in spreading Amnesty International's human rights message, as one of the reasons why U2 were awarded the <a href="Ambassador%20of%20Conscience%20Award">Ambassador of Conscience Award</a> by the organization in 2005.

Reflecting on the applause given to the Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 magazine "Propaganda" called the result "about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. It was one of those ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment." Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv ... anywhere music meant more than entertainment". He added "to be able to address General Pinochet from the stage on live television in Chile and say, 'Give the dead back to the living. Please, General Pinochet, tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are.' That was an extraordinary moment ... certainly in my life and U2's." When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating "it's proof to me that a rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings... If they don't agree with you, they will let you know – but that doesn't mean they're not fans... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us." U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who was in the process of becoming a <a href="Senator%20for%20life">Senator for life</a> after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.

"Mothers of the Disappeared" has been <a href="cover%20version">covered</a> several times. The <a href="Vitamin%20String%20Quartet">Vitamin String Quartet</a> included it on their 2004 tribute album "The String Quartet Tribute to U2's The Joshua Tree". <a href="Paddy%20Casey">Paddy Casey</a> recorded a version for the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">tsunami relief</a> album "<a href="Even%20Better%20Than%20the%20Real%20Thing%20Vol.%203">Even Better Than the Real Thing Vol. 3</a>" in 2005.

Tropical Storm Nicole (2010)

Tropical Storm Nicole was a short-lived and unusually asymmetric <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that caused extensive rainfall and flooding in <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> during the <a href="2010%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2010 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. It was the sixteenth tropical cyclone and the fourteenth <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> of the season, as well as the last of a record eight tropical storms to form in September. Originating from a broad <a href="Monsoon%20trough">monsoonal low</a>, Nicole became a tropical depression over the northwestern <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> on September 28. It maintained an unusual structure as it tracked northeastward, with a poorly defined wind circulation and few thunderstorms near its center. Nicole approached the coast of Cuba as a weak tropical storm, losing its status as a tropical cyclone over the territory on September 29. The remnants emerged over the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> and eventually became absorbed by a separate <a href="Extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical system</a>.

Due to Nicole's atypical structure, the strongest thundershowers were well removed from the center; most of the weather activity occurred over the north-central Caribbean. In Jamaica, the storm triggered widespread power outages across more than 288,000 residences. Extreme precipitation of up to caused disastrous flooding in several <a href="Parishes%20of%20Jamaica">parishes</a>, severely damaging or destroying 528 houses. The devastation extended to the island's farmland and environment, which suffered from expansive water pollution. In all, Nicole wrought an estimated $245.4 million (2010 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>) in damage throughout Jamaica, and there were sixteen fatalities. Elsewhere, minor flooding occurred in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, and the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a>. The remnants of the storm contributed to a large disturbance along the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a>, causing additional damage and deaths.

In late September 2010, a wide <a href="Rainband">band</a> of disturbed weather and <a href="Low-pressure%20area">low pressure</a>, associated with the <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> and remnant tropical moisture from <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Matthew%20%282010%29">Tropical Storm Matthew</a>, meandered over the northwestern <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>. With a broad upper <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> anchored along the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán</a> coast, <a href="Deformation%20%28meteorology%29%23Stretching%20direction">diffluence</a> aloft in the vicinity of the disturbance provided focus for the development of scattered <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convection</a>. The <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) noted an environment supportive of <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical development</a>, and by September 27, a broad surface low formed amid the convection. The next day, <a href="Atmospheric%20pressure">surface pressures</a> steadily dropped as <a href="Maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained wind</a>s around the low proximated tropical storm force. Throughout the development process, moderate westerly <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> over the region caused the disturbance to exhibit a rather asymmetric structure; it developed an elongated low-pressure center by September 28, well to the northwest of its <a href="Radius%20of%20maximum%20wind">strongest wind field</a>. Despite the asymmetry, the NHC initiated advisories on a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone">tropical depression</a> around 15:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> that day, after <a href="Surface%20weather%20analysis">surface</a> and <a href="Weather%20satellite">satellite observation</a>s revealed a sufficiently defined circulation center west of the deep convection. Post-season reassessments, however, indicated that a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone">tropical storm</a> had, in fact, formed three hours earlier, about 75 miles (120 km) south of Cuba's <a href="Isla%20de%20la%20Juventud">Isle of Youth</a>, which operationally was not named Nicole until a day later. 

For most of its duration, Nicole maintained a generally northeastward motion, caught in the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Environmental%20steering">steering flow</a> between a large mid- to upper-level <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> and an <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> to the west. Within hours of the storm's formation, observations from a <a href="hurricane%20hunters">hurricane hunters</a> flight confirmed a composition similar to the one initially discerned, with the strongest gusts and thunderstorms dislocated 250 mi (400 km) east from the ill-defined center. In comparison, the core consisted of light winds and sporadic convection—a structure rather characteristic of a North Indian Ocean <a href="monsoon%20depression">monsoon depression</a>. The system's ambiguous nature led to disagreement among weather specialist over its classification: while the NHC maintained its tropical cyclone status, Cuban meteorologist José Rubiera stated that "no tropical storm exists over [Cuba], or near it," noting a lack of significant winds in the country's vicinity.

Over the course of September 29, <a href="Weather%20radar">radar data</a> showed the convection increasing over the northern half of the storm; bands of intense thunderstorms in the southeastern periphery also formed closer to the center, and <a href="weather%20buoy">weather buoy</a>s and <a href="Weather%20ship">ships</a> in that region observed sustained tropical-storm-force winds. Around 12:00 UTC, Nicole attained an estimated peak intensity of winds and a minimum pressure of , just south of Cuba. Despite the increase in strength, Nicole's circulation soon became exceedingly elongated and untrackable over central Cuba, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone by 15:00 UTC. The remnant low began interacting with the neighboring trough that had steered Nicole in its tropical stages, resulting in significant precipitation along the southeastern coastlines of the United States. Accelerating toward the northeast, the system acquired <a href="Weather%20front">frontal characteristics</a> and became <a href="Extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> over <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a> by 0600 UTC, September 30, twelve hours before merging with a developing system over eastern <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. Lingering low pressure and broad cyclonic flow over the north-central Caribbean in Nicole's wake contributed to the development of <a href="Hurricane%20Paula">Hurricane Paula</a> in the first weeks of October.

In anticipation of a tropical storm, <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">warnings</a> were issued for the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, the northwestern and central Bahamas, and the Cuban provinces of <a href="Matanzas%20Province">Matanzas</a>, <a href="Cienfuegos%20Province">Cienfuegos</a>, <a href="Villa%20Clara%20Province">Villa Clara</a>, <a href="Sancti%20Sp%C3%ADritus%20Province">Sancti Spíritus</a>, and <a href="Ciego%20de%20%C3%81vila%20Province">Ciego de Ávila</a> on September 28. However, the warnings were discontinued the following day after reports of the storm's prompt dissipation. After forecasters warned of severe weather across the Cayman Islands, schools and government offices closed in low-lying areas, and emergency teams cleaned out storm drains and readied shelters. Thunderstorms in <a href="Grand%20Cayman">Grand Cayman</a> forced <a href="Cayman%20Airways">Cayman Airways</a> to cancel all express flights to <a href="Cayman%20Brac">Cayman Brac</a> and <a href="Little%20Cayman">Little Cayman</a> on October 29; weather-resistant jet service was provided to stranded passengers. A marine warning was required for all three islands due to rough sea conditions.

In <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, a <a href="flash%20flood%20warning">flash flood warning</a> remained in effect for flood-prone regions for four days, ultimately discontinued on October 3. Schools and several businesses, including the US Embassy in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston</a>, closed on September 29–30 as the island braced for heavy rains. Public transit was suspended islandwide on the evening of September 29, and shipping interests were cautioned to secure their vessels. At the height of the storm, army and police officials patrolled the island in case of emergencies.

Tropical storm warnings were issued for the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>, the <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a>, and from the <a href="Jupiter%2C%20Florida">Jupiter Inlet</a> coast southward to <a href="Cape%20Sable">Cape Sable</a> on September 28. A tropical storm watch was in place for the mainland north from the Jupiter Inlet to the <a href="Sebastian%20Inlet">Sebastian Inlet</a> and north of East Cape Sable to <a href="Chokoloskee%2C%20Florida">Chokoloskee</a>. The warnings and watch were discontinued the next day, after a direct impact was no longer expected. At the time, a flood watch remained in effect for <a href="Palm%20Beach%20County%2C%20Florida">Palm Beach</a>, <a href="Broward%20County%2C%20Florida">Broward</a>, <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Miami-Dade</a>, <a href="Collier%20County%2C%20Florida">Collier</a>, and <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Florida">Monroe</a> counties into September 30. An airport weather warning was issued for <a href="Orlando%20International%20Airport">Orlando International Airport</a> and <a href="Orlando%20Executive%20Airport">Executive Airport</a> on September 28; arriving flights were put on hold, and pilots rerouted to other airports if possible. Eight <a href="Southwest%20Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a> flights were diverted to the airports of <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a> and <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a>, and one <a href="JetBlue">JetBlue</a> flight to <a href="Palm%20Beach%20International%20Airport">West Palm Beach</a>. Though airport officials later reported normalized conditions, an additional 26 flights were canceled at <a href="Miami%20International%20Airport">Miami International Airport</a> the next day.

In <a href="Brunswick%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Brunswick</a> and <a href="New%20Hanover%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">New Hanover</a> counties, North Carolina, officials readied shelters on September 29 to accommodate stranded residents unable to access their homes. Multiple schools in New Hanover and <a href="Pender%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Pender County</a> remained closed the next morning due to worsening storm conditions from the disturbance succeeding Nicole. At the threat of prolonged rainfall, a flood watch was issued for <a href="Kent%20County%2C%20Maryland">Kent County</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, from September 30 to October 1. Also in the area, the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> declared both a <a href="coastal%20flood%20advisory">coastal flood advisory</a> and <a href="Gale%20warning">wind advisory</a> for September 30.

Nicole and its precursor disturbance brought great rainfall to much of Jamaica over a period of several days. A maximum of was recorded in Belleisle, <a href="Westmoreland%20Parish">Westmoreland Parish</a>, from September 26 to 30; most other parishes received more than during the same period. With a <a href="return%20period">return period</a> of 30 years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale wind regime over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three <a href="microburst">microburst</a>s—small downdrafts of intense winds. With dozens of river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes.
The disaster affected 507,831 people on the island; it resulted in 16 deaths—14 of which confirmed—and 42 injuries. In <a href="Saint%20Andrew%20Parish%2C%20Jamaica">Saint Andrew Parish</a>'s Sandy Park, a house next to a street <a href="gully">gully</a> succumbed to the effects of the storm; five bodies were recovered near the site, while the final missing inhabitant was presumed dead. Elsewhere in Saint Andrew, three construction workers were killed when the shed in which they were sleeping caved in. A girl was crushed to death under the weight of a collapsed board house in <a href="Saint%20Catherine%20Parish">Saint Catherine Parish</a>. Rushing waters swept away three people in different parts of the island, all of whom drowned. Amid a microburst, a <a href="waterspout">waterspout</a> tore roofs off buildings and hospitalized five residents in Westmoreland Parish's capital of <a href="Savanna-la-Mar">Savanna-la-Mar</a>, while to the northwest, strong gusts and rough surf impacted the resort town of <a href="Negril">Negril</a>. In the wake of the storm, a body was recovered from debris along a road in Saint Catherine. Flooded streets, roads and bridges isolated communities across seven of the island's parishes and trapped hundreds of residents in their homes.

Jamaica's infrastructure was devastated in the deluge, accounting for most of Nicole's damage to the island. More than 288,000 residences were without power at the height of the storm due to downed electricity lines and poles. About 40 percent of the island's water supply had been disrupted at some point. Dozens of bridges experienced total collapse under the force of swollen rivers and creeks. In Kingston, many underpasses became totally inundated as the prolonged rain overwhelmed storm drains; the flooding that followed left many of the city's roads impassable. Destruction to the infrastructure was especially extensive in Westmoreland, <a href="Saint%20Elizabeth%20Parish">Saint Elizabeth</a>, and <a href="Hanover%20Parish">Hanover</a> parishes, though overall, 543 of the island's principle roads sustained at least some degree of damage. The total costs linked to the infrastructure neared <a href="Jamaican%20dollar">J$</a>20 billion (US$235.4 million).

Nicole also wreaked widespread property damage: of the 2,169 homes affected, 474 sustained severe damage while 54 were beyond repair. The losses totaled J$274.3 million (US$3.2 million), J$75.6 million (US$890,000) hereof to replace destroyed housing units. With much of the island's crops and livestock washed away, including 40 percent of the season's banana produce, the agricultural sector suffered J$576.5 million (US$6.8 million) in losses. The storm had a discernible impact on the environment, which plays a crucial role in the Jamaica's economy and tourism sectors. <a href="Surface%20runoff">Surface runoff</a> and spills along industrial zones and sewage systems infiltrated large stretches of land, leading to soil contamination, coastal erosion, and deteriorated ecosystems. In addition, there were traces of light damage to vegetation, such as uprooted trees.

While Nicole was intensifying offshore, its outer bands produced heavy downpours over drought-stricken Cuba. Rain quantities were particularly high along the southeastern coast; a 48-hour total of fell at <a href="Cape%20Cruz">Cape Cruz</a>, in the mountainous <a href="Granma%20Province">Granma Province</a>. The region also briefly observed <a href="gale">gale</a>-force winds, with gusts to at <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>. Throughout eastern Cuba, nearly 300 people sought refuge from the storm. As the rivers in Granma overflowed, eight houses collapsed and more than 300 others were inundated in the coastal town of <a href="Pil%C3%B3n%2C%20Cuba">Pilón</a>. The flooding obstructed several roads, with sections of the highway between Granma and <a href="Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a> destroyed. The storm resulted in 5,000 lbs (2.5 <a href="Tonne">tons</a>) of lost crops and livestock. These effects were nevertheless considered to be minor when viewed against the rainfall's alleviation of a persistent dry spell.
In the Cayman Islands, gusts to stirred up rough seas with waves, which caused some light erosion along southern and western shores. Rainfall over the region was heavy and widespread, although the greatest quantities fell over Grand Cayman; the <a href="Owen%20Roberts%20International%20Airport">Owen Roberts International Airport</a> recorded over a two-day period. Overall damage to the islands was limited: The blustery rains flooded low-lying areas, caused roof leaks, and knocked out the power in eastern Grand Cayman.

Despite the initial threat of strong thunderstorms and gusts, Florida was spared a direct hit from Nicole. The storm skirted the state with only showers; of rain were recorded at <a href="North%20Key%20Largo%2C%20Florida">North Key Largo</a>, though the mainland received much smaller quantities. The storm flooded streets in <a href="Miami%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Miami Beach</a> and the northern Florida Keys, as well as one home. Similarly, inclement weather spread over the northwestern Bahamas without significant consequences.

The extratropical remnants of Nicole retained plenty of moisture and ultimately combined with a large low-pressure system slowly tracking up the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. East Coast</a>. The resultant disturbance produced torrential thunderstorms over entire coastlines and inland as far north as Canada, causing widespread power outages and shattering numerous precipitation records throughout the region. The most extreme weather was concentrated over <a href="Eastern%20North%20Carolina">Eastern North Carolina</a>; during the week of September 24–October 1, most communities there recorded rainfall totals of at least . <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington</a> measured of rain, the most it had received over a five-day period since 1871, while <a href="Kinston%2C%20North%20Carolina">Kinston</a> recorded during that time. Widespread flooding, exacerbated by overflowing creeks and rivers, engulfed blocks of homes. About 150 roads were closed off due to the hazardous conditions; seven people were nonetheless killed in traffic accidents across the state.
In the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20%28United%20States%29">Mid-Atlantic</a>, the weather event broke the 24-hour rainfall record for September 30 at several locations: the <a href="Norfolk%20International%20Airport">Norfolk</a>, <a href="Baltimore%E2%80%93Washington%20International%20Airport">Baltimore–Washington</a>, and <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20Washington%20National%20Airport">Ronald Reagan Washington</a> airports recorded , , and , respectively. In Maryland, two buses collided amid the stormy weather, injuring 26 of their passengers. With localized estimates of up to , the state of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> experienced some of its most historic rainfall; an official total shattered the 24-hour record for any calendar day in <a href="Binghamton%2C%20New%20York">Binghamtom</a>. Flash floods throughout the state resulted in one drowning death and US$10,000 in damage. Considerable flooding also occurred in <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> and <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, with a 24-hour rainfall maximum of in <a href="Moscow%2C%20Pennsylvania">Moscow</a>. Farther north, the remnant low enhanced a <a href="pressure%20gradient">pressure gradient</a> over southern <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, generating strong winds that knocked out the power in <a href="Litchfield%20County%2C%20Connecticut">Litchfield County</a>. Rainfall there additionally caused minor flooding. In <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, torrents following of rainfall inundated basements and caused two drownings. Despite the deaths and damage, the rains lightened prolonged drought conditions in those regions.

On October 5, a <a href="State%20of%20emergency">national disaster</a> was declared for Jamaica due to the effects of Nicole. In response, the <a href="United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">USAID</a>'s <a href="Office%20of%20Foreign%20Disaster%20Assistance">Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance</a> provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4 million (US$46,800) was donated by the <a href="Agriculture%20ministry">Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries</a> to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a>, an estimated J$12 million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with <a href="Preventive%20healthcare%23Prophylaxis">prophylactic medication</a> and vitamins to avert <a href="foot%20rot">foot rot</a> disease in small <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2 million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50 million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and <a href="Plantain%20%28cooking%29">plantain</a> farmers.
Eleven days after the storm, the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Societies">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a> allocated <a href="Swiss%20franc">CHF</a>150,644 (US$156,221) to sustain the Jamaica Red Cross in distributing aid to about 500 families—or 2,500 beneficiaries—in need of life supplies. In late December 2010, the Jamaica–Canadian Association in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> raised a total of <a href="Canadian%20dollar">CDN$</a>10,153.87 (US$10,221.33) in relief funds for flood victims. The <a href="Hanover%20Parish">Hanover Parish</a> Council requested J$30 million (US$351,000) to assist the <a href="Saint%20James%20Parish%2C%20Jamaica">Saint James Parish</a> Council and other municipal authorities across the country in post-storm clean-up and beautification work. A grant of J$279 million (US$3.26 million) was approved for the reconstruction of a major roadway section in Westmoreland Parish.

In spite of the timely relief efforts, Nicole's effects were still felt for months in its wake. The <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> for Jamaica, which had been suffering from a substantially slow <a href="Economic%20growth">economic growth rate</a>, further declined following the extensive damage. The agriculture sector sustained slight losses from reduced egg production due to the storm's traumatizing effects on farm chickens, and in the face of high repair costs the island saw below-standard levels of holiday season consumption.

Armed Forces Special Weapons Project

The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) was a United States military agency responsible for those aspects of <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s remaining under military control after the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> was succeeded by the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> on 1 January 1947. These responsibilities included the maintenance, storage, surveillance, security and handling of nuclear weapons, as well as supporting <a href="nuclear%20testing">nuclear testing</a>. The AFSWP was a joint organization, staffed by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>; its chief was supported by deputies from the other two services. <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves">Leslie R. Groves</a>, the former head of the Manhattan Project, was its first chief.

The early nuclear weapons were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as components rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The short life of their <a href="lead%E2%80%93acid%20battery">lead-acid batteries</a> and <a href="modulated%20neutron%20initiator">modulated neutron initiator</a>s, and the heat generated by the <a href="Pit%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">fissile core</a>s, precluded storing them assembled. The large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care be taken in handling. Groves hand-picked a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling of the weapons. They in turn trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force.

As nuclear weapons development proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, and easier to store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became more involved in stockpile management and providing administrative, technical and logistical support. It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after <a href="Operation%20Sandstone">Operation Sandstone</a> in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the <a href="Defense%20Atomic%20Support%20Agency">Defense Atomic Support Agency</a> (DASA), a field agency of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a>.

<a href="Nuclear%20weapon">Nuclear weapon</a>s were developed during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> by the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, a major research and development effort led by the United States, with participation from the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, it was under the direction of <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, of the <a href="US%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">US Army Corps of Engineers</a>. It created a network of production facilities, most notably for <a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a> at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> production at <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford, Washington</a> and weapons research and design at the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> in <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>. The nuclear weapons that were developed were used in the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> in August 1945.

After the war ended, the Manhattan Project supported the <a href="nuclear%20weapons%20test">nuclear weapons test</a>ing at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> as part of <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> in 1946. One of <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="James%20Forrestal">James Forrestal</a>'s aides, <a href="Lewis%20Strauss">Lewis Strauss</a> proposed this series of tests to refute "loose talk to the effect that the fleet is obsolete in the face of this new weapon." The nuclear weapons were handmade devices, and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended, but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development.

Groves's biggest concern was about people. Soldiers and scientists wanted to return to their peacetime pursuits, and there was a danger that wartime knowledge would be lost, leaving no one who knew how to handle and maintain nuclear weapons, much less how to improve the weapons and processes. The military side of the Manhattan Project had relied heavily on <a href="reservist">reservist</a>s, as the policy of the Corps of Engineers was to assign regular officers to field commands. The reservists were now eligible for separation. To replace them, Groves asked for fifty <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a> graduates from the top ten percent of their classes to man bomb assembly teams at <a href="Sandia%20Base">Sandia Base</a>, where the assembly staff and facilities had been moved from Los Alamos and <a href="Wendover%20Field">Wendover Field</a> in September and October 1945. He felt that only such high quality personnel would be able to work with the scientists who were currently doing the job. They were also urgently required for many other jobs in the postwar Army. When <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Thomas%20T.%20Handy">Thomas T. Handy</a> turned down his request, Groves raised the matter with the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the Army</a>, <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">General of the Army</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, who similarly did not approve it. Groves then went over his head too, and took it to the <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a>, who agreed with Groves. The personnel manned the 2761st Engineer Battalion (Special), which became a field unit under the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP).

Groves hoped that a new, permanent agency would be created to take over the responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project in 1945, but passage of the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a> through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million for research and development, and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.

The Atomic Energy Act provided for a Military Liaison Committee to advise the AEC on military matters, so Patterson appointed <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Lewis%20H.%20Brereton">Lewis H. Brereton</a>, who became chairman, along with Major General <a href="Lunsford%20E.%20Oliver">Lunsford E. Oliver</a> and Colonel <a href="John%20H.%20Hinds">John H. Hinds</a> as Army members of the Military Liaison Committee; Forrestal appointed <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a>s <a href="Thorvald%20A.%20Solberg">Thorvald A. Solberg</a>, <a href="Ralph%20A.%20Ofstie">Ralph A. Ofstie</a> and <a href="William%20S.%20Parsons">William S. Parsons</a> as its naval members.

Patterson asked Groves to create a new agency to take over responsibility for the aspects of nuclear weapons that still remained under the military. It was to be jointly staffed by the Army and Navy, and on 29 January 1947, Patterson and Forrestal issued a memorandum that formally established the AFSWP. Its chief would be appointed jointly by the Chief of Staff of the Army and the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a>, along with a deputy from the opposite service. Both would be members of the Military Liaison Committee, because the Atomic Energy Act stipulated that the Military Liaison Committee was the sole military body that dealt with the AEC. In February 1947, Eisenhower and Chief of Naval Operations <a href="Fleet%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Fleet Admiral</a> <a href="Chester%20W.%20Nimitz">Chester W. Nimitz</a> appointed Groves as head of the AFSWP, with Parsons as his deputy. Accordingly, Groves was appointed to the Military Liaison Committee, although the newly appointed AEC chairman, <a href="David%20E.%20Lilienthal">David E. Lilienthal</a>, told Patterson that he did not think that it was a good idea, because Groves had run the Manhattan Project by himself for four years, and was not used to having to compromise.

Groves and Parsons drafted a proposed organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves did not get everything that he asked for; he wanted a status equal to that of a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the <a href="National%20Security%20Act%20of%201947">National Security Act of 1947</a> created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Chief of Staff of the Air Force</a> as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General <a href="Roscoe%20C.%20Wilson">Roscoe C. Wilson</a>, who had worked on the <a href="Silverplate">Silverplate</a> project during the war.

Groves initially established the headquarters of the AFSWP in the old offices of the Manhattan Project on the fifth floor of the <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman%20Building">New War Department Building</a> in Washington, DC, but on 15 April 1947 it moved to <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>. As AFSWP headquarters expanded, it filled up its original accommodation, and began using office space in other parts of the building, which was not satisfactory from a security point of view. In August 1949, it moved to of new offices inside the Pentagon. This included space for a soundproof conference room, a darkroom, and vaults where its records and films were stored.
The 2761st Engineer Battalion (Special) at Sandia was commanded by <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> Gilbert M. Dorland, and consisted of a headquarters company, a security company (Company A), a bomb assembly company (Company B) and a radiological monitoring company (Company C), although Company C was never fully formed. For training purposes, Company B was initially divided into command, electrical, mechanical and nuclear groups, but the intention was to create three integrated 36-man bomb assembly teams. To free the bomb assembly teams from having to train newcomers, a Technical Training Group (TTG) was created under <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> John A. Ord, a <a href="Signal%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Signal Corps</a> officer with a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Science">Doctor of Science</a> degree from <a href="Carnegie%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Carnegie Institute of Technology</a> who had directed the training of thousands of radar technicians at the <a href="Southern%20Signal%20Corps%20School">Southern Signal Corps School</a> during the war. The battalion was redesignated the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) in April 1947, and in July it became part of the newly created AFSWP Field Command, under the command of <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Robert%20M.%20Montague">Robert M. Montague</a>. The TTG was soon reporting directly to Montague as well.

The first bomb assembly team was formed in August 1947, followed by a second in December and a third in March 1948. Experience with assembling the bombs convincingly demonstrated the requirement, in Sandia if not in Washington, for a much larger unit. Groves reluctantly approved a 109-man special weapons unit, and Montague converted the three lettered companies of the 38th Engineer Battalion into special weapons units. In 1948, they began training a Navy special weapons unit, as the Navy foresaw delivery of nuclear weapons with its new <a href="North%20American%20AJ%20Savage">North American AJ Savage</a> bombers from its s. This unit became the 471st Naval Special Weapons Unit on its certification in August 1948. Two Air Force units were created in September and December 1948, which became the 502d and 508th Aviation Squadrons. An additional Army special weapons unit was created in May 1948, and in December, the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) became the 8460th Special Weapons Group, with all seven special weapons units under its command. The four Army units were then renamed the 111th, 122d, 133d and 144th Special Weapons Units. During the late 1940s the Air Force gradually became the major user of nuclear weapons, and by the end of 1949, it had twelve assembly units, and another three in training, while the Army had only four, and the Navy three, one for each of the three "Midway"-class carriers.

In March 1948, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General <a href="Carl%20Spaatz">Carl Spaatz</a>, proposed that the Air Force take over the AFSWP, on the grounds that the <a href="Key%20West%20Agreement">Key West Agreement</a> had given it responsibility for strategic bombing. This would have simplified command of the AFSWP, as it would have been answerable to only one service chief instead of three The Army cautiously supported the proposal, but the Navy was strongly opposed, fearing that the Air Force's confusion of atomic bombing and strategic bombing would impede or even prevent the Navy from having access to nuclear weapons, which it felt was necessary to accomplish its primary maritime mission. Another series of talks was held at the <a href="Naval%20War%20College">Naval War College</a> in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, from 20 to 22 August 1948, which resulted in the <a href="Newport%20Agreement">Newport Agreement</a>, under which the Navy agreed to drop its opposition to the AFSWP being placed under the Air Force temporarily, in return for the Air Force recognizing the Navy's requirement for nuclear weapons. When the Air Force moved to make the temporary arrangement permanent in September 1948, the Army and Navy objected, and the Military Liaison Committee directed that the AFSWP should remain a tri-service organization answerable to the three service chiefs.

Groves and the wartime director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a>, had begun the move of ordnance functions to Sandia in late 1945. The laboratory's ordnance engineering division, known as Z Division, after its first director, <a href="Jerrold%20R.%20Zacharias">Jerrold R. Zacharias</a>, was split between Los Alamos and Sandia. Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the mechanical and electrical reliability of the Mark 3 <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a> bomb, but this work was disrupted by the Crossroads tests.
The 1947 nuclear stockpile consisted of nuclear weapons components, not weapons. Meeting with Truman in April 1947, Lilienthal informed him that not only were there no assembled weapons, but there were only a few sets of components, and no fully trained bomb assembly teams. By August 1946, Sandia Base held electrical and mechanical assemblies for about 50 Fat Man bombs, but there were only nine <a href="Pit%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">fissile core</a>s in storage. The stockpile of cores grew to 13 in 1947, and 53 in 1948. Oppenheimer noted that the bombs were "still largely the haywire contraptions that were slapped together in 1945." With a half-life of only 140 days, the polonium-beryllium <a href="modulated%20neutron%20initiator">modulated neutron initiator</a>s had to be periodically removed from the plutonium pits, tested, and, if necessary, replaced. The cores had to be stored separately from the high explosive blocks that would surround them in the bomb because they generated enough heat to melt the plastic explosive over time. The heat could also affect the cores themselves, provoking a <a href="phase%20transition">phase transition</a> to a different <a href="allotropes%20of%20plutonium">allotrope of plutonium</a>. They had to be periodically inspected by technicians wearing gloves and respirators. The bomb's electrical power for its radar fuzes and detonators came from a pair of <a href="lead%E2%80%93acid%20battery">lead-acid batteries</a> similar to those used in cars. These had to be charged 24 hours before use. After a few days, the bomb had to be partially disassembled so that they could be re-charged; and three days after that the batteries had to be replaced.
The 38th Engineer Battalion's electrical group studied the batteries, the electrical firing systems and the radar fuzes which detonated the bomb at the required altitude. The mechanical group dealt with the <a href="exploding-bridgewire%20detonator">exploding-bridgewire detonator</a>s and the <a href="explosive%20lens">explosive lens</a>es. The nuclear group moved to Los Alamos to study the cores and initiators. As part of their training, they attended lectures by <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>, <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a>, <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>. The electrical and mechanical groups at Sandia, although not the nuclear group, completed their training around the end of October 1946 and spent the next month devising the best methods of assembling a Fat Man, drawing up detailed checklists so that later bomb assembly teams could be trained. They also drew up a proposed <a href="table%20of%20organization%20and%20equipment">table of organization and equipment</a> for an assembly team. It took two weeks for them to assemble their first bomb in December 1946.

Most of 1947 was spent planning for a field exercise in which a bomb team would deploy to a base and assemble weapons under field conditions. A by portable building was acquired and outfitted as field workshops that could be loaded onto a <a href="Douglas%20C-54%20Skymaster">C-54</a> or <a href="Boeing%20C-97%20Stratofreighter">C-97</a> transport aircraft. In November 1947, the 38th Engineer Battalion carried out its first major field exercise, Operation Ajax. It drew bomb components, except for fissile cores, from the AEC, and deployed by air to <a href="Wendover%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wendover Field, Utah</a>. This was the home of the <a href="509th%20Bombardment%20Group">509th Bombardment Group</a>, which was the only unit operating Silverplate <a href="B-29">B-29</a> bombers, and therefore the only B-29 group capable of delivering nuclear weapons. To simulate operational conditions, they took a roundabout route via New England and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. Over the following ten days, they assembled bombs and flew training missions with them, including a live drop at the <a href="Naval%20Ordnance%20Test%20Station">Naval Ordnance Test Station</a> at <a href="Inyokern%2C%20California">Inyokern, California</a>.

This was followed by other exercises. In one exercise in March 1948, the base personnel successfully fought off an "attack" by 250 paratroopers from <a href="Fort%20Hood%2C%20Texas">Fort Hood, Texas</a>. In another exercise in November 1948, the 471st Special Weapons Unit flew to <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, and practiced bomb assembly on board the "Midway"-class aircraft carriers.

In addition to assembly of weapons, the AFSWP supported nuclear weapons testing. For <a href="Operation%20Sandstone">Operation Sandstone</a> in 1948, Groves ordered Dorland to fill every possible job with his men. He did this so well that Strauss, now an AEC commissioner, became disturbed at the number of AFSWP personnel who were participating, and feared that the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> might launch a sneak attack on <a href="Enewetak">Enewetak</a> to wipe out the nation's ability to assemble nuclear weapons. The successful testing in Operation Sandstone was a major leap forward. The new <a href="Mark%204%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 4 nuclear bomb</a> that the AEC began delivering in 1949 was a production design that was much easier to assemble and maintain, and enabled a bomb assembly team to be reduced to just 46 men. <a href="Kenneth%20D.%20Nichols">Kenneth D. Nichols</a>, the wartime commander of the Manhattan District, now "recommended that we should be thinking in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds."

After Operation Sandstone, only relatively small numbers of AFSWP personnel were involved in nuclear testing. The AFSWP was heavily involved in the planning, preparation and coordination of tests, but it had limited participation in the tests themselves, where the bomb assembly function was usually undertaken by scientists. During <a href="Operation%20Buster-Jangle">Operation Buster-Jangle</a>, AFSWP personnel showed films and gave lectures to 2,800 military personnel who had been selected to witness the test, explaining what would occur and the procedures to be followed. This was expanded to cater for the more than 7,000 personnel who were involved in <a href="Operation%20Upshot%E2%80%93Knothole">Operation Upshot–Knothole</a> in 1953.

When the AEC was formed in 1947 it acquired custody of nuclear components from the Manhattan Project on the understanding that the matter would be reviewed. In November 1947, the Military Liaison Committee requested that custody of the nuclear stockpile be transferred to the military, but Lilienthal believed that AEC custody of the stockpile was an important aspect of civilian control of nuclear weapons. He was disturbed that the AFSWP had not informed the AEC in advance of Operation Ajax. For his part, Groves suspected that the AEC was not keeping bomb components in the condition in which the military wanted to receive them, and Operation Ajax only confirmed his suspicions. Reviewing the exercise, Montague reported that "under the existing law, with the AEC charged with procurement and custody of all atomic weapons, there was no adequate logistic support for the weapon." He recommended a larger role for the military, a recommendation with which Groves concurred, but was powerless to implement.
Groves retired at the end of February 1948, and Nichols was designated as his successor with the rank of major general. At the same time, Forrestal, now the <a href="Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a>, reorganized the Military Liaison Committee. A civilian, Donald F. Carpenter, replaced Brereton as chairman, and there were now two members from each of the three services. On 11 March, Truman summoned Lilienthal, Nichols and <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Army">Secretary of the Army</a> <a href="Kenneth%20C.%20Royall">Kenneth C. Royall</a> to his office, and told them that he expected the AFSWP and the AEC to cooperate.

Nichols's position was the same as Groves's and Montague's: that nuclear weapons needed to be available in an emergency, and the men who had to use them in battle needed to have experience with their maintenance, storage and handling. <a href="Norris%20Bradbury">Norris Bradbury</a>, who had replaced Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in December 1945, argued that rapid transfer could be accomplished by improved procedures and that the other difficulties could best be resolved by further development, mostly from the scientists. Forrestal and Carpenter took the matter up with Truman, who issued his decision on 21 July 1948: "I regard the continued control of all aspects of the atomic energy program, including research, development and the custody of atomic weapons as the proper functions of the civil authorities."

With the outbreak of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> in 1950, air transport resources were put under great strain, and it was decided to reduce the requirement for it by pre-positioning non-nuclear components at locations in Europe and the Pacific. That way, in an emergency, only the nuclear components would have to be flown out. In June, Truman ordered the transfer of 90 sets of non-nuclear Mark 4 components to the AFSWP for training purposes. In December, he authorized the carriage of non-nuclear components on board the "Midway"-class carriers. In April 1951, the AEC released nine Mark 4 weapons to the Air Force in case the Soviet Union intervened in the war in Korea. These were flown to Guam, where they were maintained by the Air Force special weapons unit there. Thus, at the end of 1951, there were 429 weapons in AEC custody and nine held by the Department of Defense.

In the light of this, a new AEC-AFSWP agreement on "Responsibilities of Stockpile Operations" was drawn up in August 1951, but in December, the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> began a new push for weapons to be permanently assigned to the armed forces, so as to ensure a greater degree of flexibility and a higher state of readiness. On 20 June 1953, Eisenhower, now as president, approved the deployment of nuclear components in equal numbers to non-nuclear components, and the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201954">Atomic Energy Act of 1954</a> amended the sections of the old act that gave exclusive custody to the AEC. By 1959, the nuclear stockpile had grown to 12,305 weapons of which 3,968 were in AEC custody and the remaining 8,337 were held by the Department of Defense. The total yield of the stockpile was now in excess of .

As Bradbury had promised, with research and development, nuclear weapons became smaller, simpler and lighter. They also became easier to store, assemble, test and maintain. Thus, while under Eisenhower's <a href="New%20Look%20%28policy%29">New Look policy</a> the Armed Forces became more heavily involved with aspects of nuclear weapons than ever, the role of the AFSWP diminished. It began moving away from training assembly teams, which were increasingly not required, as its primary mission, and became more involved in the management of the rapidly growing nuclear stockpile, and providing technical advice and logistical support. In 1953, the AFSWP Field Command had 10,250 personnel. On 16 October 1953, the Secretary of Defense charged the AFSWP with responsibility for "a centralized system of reporting and accounting to ensure that the current status and location" of all nuclear weapons "will be known at all times". The Atomic Warfare Status Center was created within the AFSWP to handle this mission.

In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for legislation to overhaul the Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and he was concerned about the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a> development, the Soviet <a href="Sputnik%20program">Sputnik program</a> had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, <a href="PGM-19%20Jupiter">PGM-19 Jupiter</a> and <a href="PGM-17%20Thor">PGM-17 Thor</a> respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500 million.

The <a href="Defense%20Reorganization%20Act%20of%201958">Defense Reorganization Act of 1958</a> was signed by Eisenhower in August 1958. It increased the authority of the Secretary of Defense, who was authorized to establish such defense agencies as he thought necessary "to provide for more effective, efficient and economical administration and operation". The first field agency established under the act was the <a href="Defense%20Atomic%20Support%20Agency">Defense Atomic Support Agency</a> (DASA), which replaced the AFSWP on 1 May 1959. The new agency reported to the Secretary of Defense through the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was given responsibility for the supervision of all Department of Defense nuclear testing, which had hitherto been handled by the individual services. Otherwise, its role and organization remained much the same, and its commander, Rear Admiral Edward N. Parker, remained as its first director. Eisenhower's proposed <a href="nuclear%20testing%20moratorium">nuclear testing moratorium</a> ultimately fundamentally changed DASA's mission, as nuclear testing was phased out, Cold War tensions eased, and nuclear disarmament became a prospect.

Eastbourne manslaughter

R v Hopley (more commonly known as the Eastbourne manslaughter) was an 1860 legal case in <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, England, concerning the death of 15-year-old Reginald Cancellor (some sources give his name as Chancellor and his age as 13 or 14) at the hands of his teacher, Thomas Hopley. Hopley used <a href="School%20corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor's part, but instead beat the boy to death.

An inquest into Cancellor's death began when his brother requested an <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a>. As a result of the inquest Hopley was arrested and charged with <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a>. He was found guilty at trial and sentenced to four years in prison, although he insisted that his actions were justifiable and that he was not guilty of any crime. The trial was sensationalised by the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> press and incited debate over the use of <a href="School%20corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment in schools</a>. After Hopley's release and subsequent divorce trial, he largely disappeared from the public record. The case became an important <a href="legal%20precedent">legal precedent</a> in the United Kingdom for discussions of corporal punishment in schools and reasonable limits on discipline.

Thomas Hopley, aged 41 at the time of the incident, was a schoolmaster in Eastbourne who ran a private <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> from his home at 22 Grand Parade. He was well educated and from a middle-class family, the son of a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> surgeon and brother of artist <a href="Edward%20Hopley">Edward Hopley</a>, author <a href="Catherine%20Cooper%20Hopley">Catherine C. Hopley</a>, and editor <a href="John%20Hopley%20%28editor%29">John Hopley</a>. His household was fairly well off, and he and his wife kept several servants. He had two children, the first of which had brain damage – "popular rumour" blamed this on "his unconventionally bracing notions of neonatal care". Hopley was described by writer <a href="Algernon%20Charles%20Swinburne">Algernon Charles Swinburne</a> as "a person of high attainments and irreproachable character". He expressed "utopian" educational ideals shared by many Victorian educational theorists. He wrote <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>s on education topics which included "Lectures on the Education of Man", "Help towards the physical, intellectual and moral elevation of all classes of society", and "Wrongs which cry out for redress" advocating the abolition of <a href="child%20labour">child labour</a>.

In October 1859, he was offered £180 a year to teach Reginald Channell Cancellor, a "robust" boy who had been "given up as ineducable". Reginald was the son of John Henry Cancellor (1799–1860), a <a href="Master%20%28judiciary%29">master</a> of the <a href="Court%20of%20Common%20Pleas">Court of Common Pleas</a> and a "man of fair position" from <a href="Barnes%2C%20Surrey">Barnes, Surrey</a>. The boy had previously been a student at a private school in <a href="St%20Leonards-on-Sea">St. Leonards</a> and under a private tutor. He was not a good student, with contemporary sources suggesting he "had <a href="water%20on%20the%20brain">water on the brain</a>" and describing him as "stolid and stupid". Hopley attributed Cancellor's failure to learn to stubbornness. On 18 April 1860 he asked the boy's father for permission to use "severe corporal punishment" to obtain compliance, with permission granted two days later. Hopley did not possess the <a href="caning">cane</a> traditionally used to administer corporal punishment to students, so instead he used a <a href="skipping%20rope">skipping rope</a> and a walking stick.

Cancellor was found dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April 1860. His body was covered, with long stockings over his legs and <a href="kidskin">kidskin</a> gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a> and argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.

Rumours began to circulate among the Hopleys' servants, suggesting that Hopley's wife had spent the night prior to the body's discovery cleaning up evidence of her husband's beating of the boy. Reginald's older brother, Reverend John Henry Cancellor, Jr. (1834–1900), arrived in Eastbourne from <a href="Send%2C%20Surrey">Send, Surrey</a>, on 25 April. He noticed discrepancies in the reports of his brother's death and requested an autopsy. Hopley asked prominent physician Sir <a href="Charles%20Locock">Charles Locock</a>, an acquaintance of the Cancellor family and an <a href="Obstetrics">obstetrician</a> to <a href="Queen%20Victoria">the Queen</a>, to examine the body and verify death by natural causes; Locock believed that Hopley was responsible for the death.

A complete inquest into Cancellor's death was initiated. His body was taken for autopsy on 28 April and was found to be covered in blood under the gloves and stockings. His thighs were "reduced to a perfect jelly" and his body was covered in bruises and cuts, including two inch-deep holes in his right leg, deep enough to allow the <a href="medical%20examiner">medical examiner</a>, Robert Willis, to touch the bone underneath. Willis reported that other than these injuries, the boy was healthy and his internal organs (including the heart) were free of disease. He thus concluded that Cancellor had not died of natural causes, as Hopley had suggested, and noted that the boy had obviously been beaten shortly before his death. A female servant named Ellen Fowler, when questioned by investigators, reported that she had heard Cancellor screaming and being beaten from 10 pm until midnight and that, shortly thereafter, he abruptly fell silent. She also noted traces of blood in the house and on Hopley's candlestick, which was left outside Cancellor's bedroom, and evidence that Cancellor's and Hopley's clothes had been washed soon before the former was pronounced dead. Two other servants testified in the inquiry and gave similar accounts.

The inquest was unable to determine Cancellor's exact cause of death, but noted several inconsistencies in Hopley's explanation of events. He had failed to summon a doctor immediately and, upon questioning, had given outlandish excuses for his failure to do so. Hopley attempted to explain away the blood on the candlestick by attributing it to a broken blister on his hand, but did not offer an explanation for Cancellor's injuries. Hopley aroused further suspicion when he asked journalists present at the inquest not to include details of the corporal punishment in their stories, "in order to spare the feelings of the deceased family as of my own". Cancellor's family was deeply affected by the case, as they had been "disinclined" to see Cancellor beaten; his father died shortly after the inquest of a "<a href="broken%20heart">broken heart</a>."

Hopley was arrested in early May and, after a seven-hour preliminary hearing, was released on 16 June on a £2,000 <a href="bail">bail</a>. He and his then-pregnant wife spent the period between the initial hearing and the trial at <a href="Uckfield">Uckfield</a>. Hopley was confident that he would be found not guilty. He began composing a pamphlet titled "Facts Bearing on the Death of Reginald Channell Cancellor", to be published after the trial; it was published by an associate of Hopley's after his conviction and detailed Hopley's explanation of Cancellor's death and his justification for his treatment of the boy. The press was extremely hostile, calling for a murder charge to be laid against him. He received a large amount of <a href="hate%20mail">hate mail</a> from anonymous members of the public.

Hopley's trial took place at <a href="Lewes">Lewes</a> <a href="Assizes">Assizes</a> on 23 July 1860, before the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20Queen%27s%20Bench">Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench</a> Sir <a href="Sir%20Alexander%20Cockburn%2C%2012th%20Baronet">Alexander Cockburn</a> and a jury. The prosecutors were <a href="John%20Humffreys%20Parry">John Humffreys Parry</a> and <a href="William%20Jerome%20Knapp">William Jerome Knapp</a>; Hopley was defended by the <a href="serjeant-at-law">serjeant-at-law</a> <a href="William%20Ballantine">William Ballantine</a>, who subsequently described Hopley as "distorted". Throughout his trial, Hopley described himself as reluctant to use corporal punishment. In describing the events preceding Cancellor's death, Hopley stated that he started crying while beating Cancellor, after which Cancellor presented his lesson and "Hopley took his head on his breast and prayed with him". Hopley presented testimonials from past students who described him as "kindly" and who noted an infrequent use of violence. Hopley claimed to be a <a href="pedagogy">paedagogical</a> follower of <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>, who had decried the use of corporal punishment except in cases of extreme obstinacy on the part of the student. He argued that, through the application of this theory, the beating that killed Cancellor had been a necessary one.

Robert Willis testified at the trial that there was no possibility that Cancellor's death had been a result of natural causes. He presented a detailed description of the boy's injuries, suggesting that they had been sustained over several hours. He also revealed that Cancellor's skull cavity contained six to eight ounces of fluid, attributing to this fluid the boy's seeming inability to learn as described by Hopley, but rejected any suggestions that it may have contributed to Cancellor's death. Cancellor's brother, Fowler, and Locock all testified against Hopley; Locock's testimony was particularly hostile, suggesting that Hopley's incompetent response to interviews was "tantamount to an admission of guilt". Other witnesses included the Hopleys' laundress, Roberts, three members of the coastguard who had seen lights on in the house late at night, a local constable, and the town registrar.
Ballantine's conduct during the trial was flawed, and he believed Hopley was insane. Although he promoted the testimonials of former students and argued that a schoolmaster was unlikely to "so lightly jeopardize his ambitions", he congratulated Locock on the accuracy of his testimony in open court. Ballantine did not call key witnesses such as Edward Philpott, another student of Hopley's who had been at the house that night. Philpott slept in the bedroom beside Cancellor's and had reported hearing no unusual noises or screams from Cancellor's room on the night of his death. Neither did Ballantine call Professor <a href="John%20Eric%20Erichsen">John Eric Erichsen</a> of <a href="University%20College%20Hospital">University College Hospital</a>, who had conducted a second autopsy on Cancellor on 11 May and suggested that "the misleading appearance of the body was attributable to an undiagnosed blood condition akin to <a href="haemophilia">haemophilia</a>". In his memoir "Some experiences of a barrister's life", published in 1883, Ballantine offered a highly sensationalised account of Cancellor's death: "the wretched half-witted victim of a lunatic's system of education was deliberately mangled to death".

Hopley was convicted of manslaughter, not <a href="murder">murder</a>, because of his position as a schoolteacher "<a href="In%20loco%20parentis">endowed with parental authority</a>". <a href="Sir%20Alexander%20Cockburn%2C%2012th%20Baronet">Sir Alexander Cockburn</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Chief Justice</a> of the <a href="King%27s%20Bench">Court of Queen's Bench</a>, presented a summary of the decision:

Cockburn further suggested that Hopley should have realised Cancellor's cognitive deficiencies and taken these into account in his treatment of the boy.

Hopley was sentenced to four years of penal servitude, and was incarcerated in Portsea and Chatham. After being indicted, he wrote of himself that "while anguish shook the frame, the conscience suffered not one pang. I searched and searched among the deepest secrets of my soul, and could not blame myself ... I could look up tranquilly into the face of heaven who knew me to be Not Guilty." He believed that his actions were justifiable because he had undertaken them in his duty as schoolteacher. He portrayed himself as a victim of public opinion, claiming that "a mournful accident was swelled up into a bloody midnight murder, and how it has been brought about that my unfortunate name has been branded, not simply through the United Kingdom, but through the civilised world, as one of the most execrable monsters or of madmen." He published a pamphlet arguing that Locock had perjured himself and had conspired with Fowler to influence the outcome of the trial.

The trial was sensationalised by contemporary media. The press derided Hopley as "monstrous", and criticised schoolteachers in general and private schoolteachers in particular. Newspapers published graphic accounts of Cancellor's injuries and autopsy and further exaggerated the early rumours surrounding his death. Cancellor's was the first death by corporal punishment to have received broad public interest. To prevent overcrowding, the court issued tickets for admission to the public gallery during the trial; the courtroom was full an hour before the trial began. After Hopley's conviction, he issued at least two pamphlets on model education from gaol, which were poorly received by the public. Hopley's fame was short-lived; a month after his conviction, the press was focused on another case of corporal punishment, that of <a href="Caroline%20Lefevre">Caroline Lefevre</a>, whose arms were allegedly burnt by her teacher.

Following Hopley's release from prison, he became immediately embroiled in a sensationalised divorce trial. His wife, Fanny, had petitioned for divorce on the <a href="Grounds%20for%20divorce">grounds</a> that he was "unloving" and had mistreated her. She claimed that Hopley had married her as an "educational experiment", presenting Hopley's educational theories as evidence of his "lunacy". She had been 18 years old to Hopley's 36 at the time of their marriage in 1855. According to her statements during the trial, Hopley frequently criticised her writing and insisted that the couple's three children should be raised as "second Christs". She accused him of physically abusing her from the time of her first pregnancy, beating their first child only days after its birth (the child was later found to be "brain-damaged"), and suggesting that during his prison sentence she should be confined to a <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>. Hopley responded by claiming that he set rules only to ensure the maintenance of his household and the wellbeing of his family, and produced a set of romantic letters he had received from Fanny during his incarceration as evidence of her unforced affection for him.

The jury found Hopley guilty of cruelty in July 1864, but suggested that Fanny had condoned his treatment of her. The judge therefore ruled that her case was insufficient to grant a divorce. The verdict sparked outrage among the public, who believed that "a great injustice had been done", and that Fanny should not be forced to remain married to an abusive convicted killer. Fanny left England shortly afterwards, allegedly to avoid having to continue living with Hopley.

Hopley largely withdrew from the public eye after the trial, becoming a private tutor in London and publishing pamphlets on <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a> in the late 1860s. He died at University College Hospital on 24 June 1876. A retrospective editorial published in "The Times" in 1960 concluded that Hopley was not "the villain which some persons pictured him to be"; it noted that at the time of his arrest Hopley had been planning the construction of a "model school" in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> and that he had examined architect's drawings of the school after beating Cancellor.

In 1865, Cancellor's death was used in a medical journal article discussing adult <a href="hydrocephalus">hydrocephalus</a>. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author <a href="Samuel%20Wilks">Samuel Wilks</a> suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, but that he was consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this <a href="effusion">effusion</a> would have caused physical weakness.

"R v Hopley" was used as an archetypal case for legal commentaries about corporal punishment until physical discipline was officially banned in British schools over a century later. According to education professor Marie Parker-Jenkins, "R v Hopley" is "the most quoted case of the 19th century involving the issue of corporal punishment". The case is credited with prompting outcry against corporal punishment among the general public, although contemporary education journals rejected the possibility of abolishing corporal punishment. Hopley's defence, known as "reasonable chastisement", became a frequently used response to charges of corporal punishment and was incorporated into the <a href="Children%20and%20Young%20Persons%20Act%201933">Children and Young Persons Act 1933</a>. Cockburn's requirement for "moderate and reasonable" punishment was established as a legal limit to corporal punishment and is still employed in modern legal scholarship.

Round Church, Preslav

The Round Church (, "Kragla tsarkva"), also known as the Golden Church (Златна църква, "Zlatna tsarkva") or the Church of St John (църква "Свети Йоан", "tsarkva "Sveti Yoan""), is a large partially preserved <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">early medieval</a> <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> church. It lies in <a href="Preslav">Preslav</a>, the former capital of the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a>, today a town in northeastern <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. The church dates to the early 10th century, the time of <a href="List%20of%20Bulgarian%20monarchs">Tsar</a> <a href="Simeon%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Simeon I</a>'s rule, and was unearthed and first archaeologically examined in 1927–1928.

Considered to be one of the most impressive examples of medieval Bulgarian architecture, the Round Church takes its name from the distinctive shape of one of its three sections, the <a href="cella">cella</a> (naos), which is a <a href="Rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a> that serves as a place of liturgy. The church's design also includes a wide atrium and a rectangular entrance area, or <a href="narthex">narthex</a>, marked by two circular turrets.

The church has been likened to examples of religious architecture from the late Roman (<a href="Early%20Christian%20architecture">Early Christian</a>) period, the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, and the <a href="Carolingian%20architecture">Carolingian Pre-Romanesque</a> of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> because of its characteristic plan, which is significantly different from contemporaneous Bulgarian or <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> buildings. The church's alternative name, the Golden Church, stems from its possible and popular identification with a "new golden church" in Preslav referenced in a medieval literary source.

The Round Church's rich interior decoration, which makes ample use of mosaics, ceramics and marble details, distinguishes it from other churches in Preslav. Its interior features hundreds of drawings depicting ships, fauna, and Christian figures. Medieval inscriptions on the walls range from names of saints in <a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a> to separate letters and short texts in the <a href="Glagolitic%20alphabet">Glagolitic</a> and <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic</a> alphabets.

Founded in 681 as a pagan state, Bulgaria was <a href="Christianization%20of%20Bulgaria">formally Christianised</a> by Byzantine clergy in the 860s, under Prince <a href="Boris%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Boris</a> (r. 852–889). The right to convert Bulgaria to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> was the subject of a political dispute between Byzantium and the <a href="Pope">Papacy</a>. With the conversion to Christianity, Boris hoped to solve internal ethnic issues and improve the foreign relations of his state, which was not treated equally by the Christian rulers of Europe.

The Round Church was constructed during the rule of Boris' son and successor, Simeon (r. 893–927), whose successful campaigns established Bulgaria's temporary superiority over Byzantium, at times threatening the Byzantine capital at <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. He extended the territory of the First Bulgarian Empire over most of the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, to the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> and the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>. Simeon also conquered the lands of modern <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> and efficiently eliminated the <a href="Hungarian%20people">Magyar</a> threat from the north. Counted among Bulgaria's greatest leaders, Simeon was a benefactor of literature and the arts; his reign is considered the "Golden Age" of medieval Bulgarian culture because of Bulgaria's literary influence over contemporary <a href="Slavic%20Europe">Slavic Europe</a>.

The city of <a href="Preslav">Preslav</a> was made the capital of Bulgaria early in Simeon's reign, partly because of the former capital <a href="Pliska">Pliska</a>'s association with pre-Christian <a href="paganism">paganism</a>. Simeon turned Preslav into a cultural centre, a true rival to Constantinople. Some of the most eminent scholars of Bulgaria's Golden Age worked at the <a href="Preslav%20Literary%20School">Preslav Literary School</a>. Intended more as a royal residence and a showcase of cultural power than a fortress, the city boasted impressive architecture, including a large number of characteristic palaces and dozens of churches. Among them the Round Church, regarded as "one of the most impressive monuments of medieval Bulgarian architecture" and an "expression of the highest achievements of Old Bulgarian culture", stood out.

The Round Church is popularly identified with the "new golden church" referenced in a <a href="Colophon%20%28publishing%29">colophon</a> to an <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic">Old Bulgarian</a> translation of <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius of Alexandria</a>'s "Orations Against the Arians". The text says that the translation was done on the order of Prince Simeon by <a href="Constantine%20of%20Preslav">Constantine of Preslav</a> and copied by Theodore Dox, "at the mouth of the <a href="Kamchia%20River">Ticha</a> in the <a href="Byzantine%20calendar">[Byzantine] year</a> 6415 <a href="indiction">indiction</a> 14 [907 AD], where the same prince had the holy new golden church built". It is uncertain whether the "mouth of the Ticha" refers to a narrow section of the river, to the Ustie pass near the city, or possibly to a certain location next to the outer city walls and in the direct vicinity of the Round Church ruins. This problem aside, if "golden" is to be taken literally, the source is also unclear as to whether the church is the new one among the city's golden churches, or the single golden one among the new churches in Preslav. Scholar Stancho Vaklinov considers the identification of the Round Church as the "new golden church" from literature "incontestable", while art historian Nikola Mavrodinov is of the opinion that it is probable. On the other hand, historian A. P. Vlasto believes this identification to be "not absolutely certain".

If the church from the <a href="marginalia">marginal note</a> is equated with the Round Church, then it can be conclusively dated to no more than a few years before 907. While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman <a href="basilica">basilica</a> due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor ("<a href="ktetor">ktetor</a>") of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official ("<a href="chartophylax">chartophylax</a>") named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.

There is debate in Bulgarian academic circles as to whether the church was built as a <a href="monastery">monastery</a> church or as a separate <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a>. If the buildings neighbouring the church are interpreted as the residential part of a monastery, it was most probably established after the construction of the Round Church, during the rule of Tsar <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Peter I</a> (r. 927–969). The absence of entrances on these buildings on the sides facing the church and the presence of a large atrium make it unlikely. Another argument against the Round Church being a monastery church is its location, isolated from other buildings yet accessible to the public outside the inner city. Scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it a city cathedral and compares it in function to the <a href="Great%20Basilica%2C%20Pliska">Great Basilica</a> in Pliska. Another researcher, Krastyu Miyatev, sees it as a royal church of Simeon, but art historian Nikola Mavrodinov and archaeologist Totyu Totev insist it belonged to a monastery from the beginning.

The earliest excavations of the site were carried out in 1927–1928 by archaeologists from the <a href="National%20Archaeological%20Museum%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Archaeological Museum</a> in <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> and the Bulgarian Antiquities Society under the direction of Yordan Gospodinov. A second effort headed by Krastyu Miyatev resulted in a much more in-depth study, and archaeological research at the site is ongoing. In 1927, the Round Church, along with the entirety of medieval Preslav, was proclaimed a historical and archaeological reserve and placed under state protection as a national antiquity. In 1970, it was individually included in the list of monuments of culture of national importance with a publication in that year's "<a href="State%20Gazette">State Gazette</a>", issue 46. As part of the Veliki Preslav architectural reserve, the Round Church is listed as No. 98 among the <a href="100%20Tourist%20Sites%20of%20Bulgaria">100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria</a>.

The Church of St Petka in <a href="Ruse%2C%20Bulgaria">Ruse</a>, opened in 1944, was built as a reconstruction of the Round Church in Preslav. The Round Church underwent partial restoration in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In December 2009, plans were announced to reconstruct the church in its entirety, without demolishing or altering any of the original structural remains. A monument dedicated to Tsar Simeon was unveiled in the immediate vicinity of the Round Church on 27 May 2007 to honour the 1080th anniversary of his death. Despite not being an active church, it is regularly used for baptisms and weddings.

The Round Church was built outside Preslav's inner city, which mostly included the royal palace and its associated buildings such as the Royal Basilica. It was still within the outer city limits, and lay in Preslav's southeastern part, some from the South Gate of the inner city. It was situated on a high <a href="Terrace%20%28geology%29">terrace</a>. Today the Round Church, along with the other ruins of medieval Preslav, lie not far from the modern town of Veliki Preslav, which is the administrative centre of a municipality in <a href="Shumen%20Province">Shumen Province</a>, northeastern Bulgaria.

While no church from this age in the Slavic-populated parts of the Balkans was up-to-date with contemporary Byzantine architecture, the Round Church differs markedly because of its centralized, circular plan, which is unique in medieval Bulgarian architecture. The rounded and dynamic nature of its shapes is in contrast with the sharp rectangular designs of that period. It is most likely based on the abundant examples of late Roman or early Byzantine buildings that lay ruined in the Bulgarian lands. The layout, particularly the <a href="Rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a>, resembles churches from the time of <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> such as the <a href="Basilica%20of%20San%20Vitale">Basilica of San Vitale</a> in <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, the <a href="Little%20Hagia%20Sophia">Little Hagia Sophia</a> in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> (today <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>), and the <a href="Arch%20of%20Galerius%20and%20Rotunda">Rotunda of Galerius</a> in <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>. Even if the plan is unusual, the technology and principles employed in its construction are contemporary to the 10th century and in accord with other monuments in Preslav.

Byzantine churches are not the only source of inspiration that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>n influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>n, Armenian, or <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgian</a> monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in <a href="Carolingian%20architecture">Carolingian architecture</a> from the time of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, and particularly the <a href="Palatine%20Chapel%20in%20Aachen">Palatine Chapel</a> in <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the <a href="Frankish%20Empire">Frankish Empire</a>. One trait of the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental <a href="westwork">westwork</a>.

The Round Church includes three sections: the wide <a href="Atrium%20%28architecture%29">atrium</a> (or <a href="courtyard">courtyard</a>), the <a href="narthex">narthex</a> and the <a href="cella">cella</a> (also naos or, due to its shape, rotunda), each serving as a premise to the other. The sections were not necessarily built at the same time, and it is generally accepted that a reconstruction of the church was carried out some time after its completion. Mavrodinov and archaeologist <a href="Karel%20%C5%A0korpil">Karel Škorpil</a> believe the narthex and cella comprised the first building period, while the atrium was added very shortly after that and by the same architect.

The church has a total length of , including the atrium. It was mostly built of rectangular <a href="limestone">limestone</a> blocks sparingly joined with <a href="mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a>. Inside the <a href="apse">apse</a>, the mortar is red-coloured. The floor was covered by <a href="marble">marble</a> and stone tiles glued on top of red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. Red and yellow bricks and pieces of bricks were used for the atrium, the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill spaces between the stones on the walls.

The outermost part of the Round Church is its atrium, the flanked open space leading into the narthex. It is accessed by means of three gates (one on each wall), of which the entrance on the main west wall is the most elaborate and grandest in appearance. The atrium is almost square in shape and measures . A <a href="water%20well">water well</a> was constructed in the center of the courtyard; it was linked to a <a href="water%20pipe">water conduit</a>.

The sides of the atrium are decorated by a multitude of vaults with <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a> in between. In total, there are fourteen vaults: four on each of the courtyard's three walls and one each where the west wall meets the sides. The atrium includes an equal number of round <a href="limestone">limestone</a> columns each standing opposite one of the piers, apart.

The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular <a href="turret">turret</a>s. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a>, because of its depth.

Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a>, while the south part was probably a <a href="baptistery">baptistery</a>, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a <a href="baptismal%20font">baptismal font</a>. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for <a href="baptism">baptism</a>, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing <a href="holy%20water">holy water</a>.

Measuring , the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach . Its two turrets have a diameter of ; each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three <a href="nave">nave</a>s and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

The round cella is the easternmost and most important part of the church, as it was where the <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> was performed. The diameter of the rotunda is . It is accessed through three gates, all from the narthex. It was entirely covered by a <a href="dome">dome</a>. Twelve vaults, <a href="semicircle">semicircular</a> as seen from the inside and <a href="pentagon">pentagon</a>al on the outer wall, were constructed north and south of the rotunda's eastern part, the apse, which itself fits into one of the vaults. Large <a href="buttress">buttress</a>es reinforce the structure both inside and outside. A circle of ten or twelve white marble columns was inscribed inside the rotunda, from the interior buttresses. The <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> of the columns are similar to those of the royal palace in Preslav. A copper-plated wooden coffin lay in a <a href="Chamber%20tomb">burial chamber</a> by one of the vaults near the apse.

The semicircular apse fits naturally with the other vaults of the rotunda despite being larger, and features vaults on its north and south walls. The marble <a href="Ambon%20%28liturgy%29">ambon</a> was situated in the center of the circle of columns and of the whole rotunda, directly under the dome's centre, as evidenced by a mortar padding. Stairs from the east and west, aligned with the apse, used to lead up to the ambon. The bishop's throne or <a href="cathedra">cathedra</a> probably lay near one of the south vaults, which was likely enlarged for the purpose.

The interior was lavishly decorated with colourful Byzantine-style <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>s, <a href="cornice">cornice</a>s, and ceramics. With the exception of the <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian</a> and <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> column capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine origin, the rest of the decoration was created specifically for and during the church's construction. Vlasto finds a <a href="Bulgars">Proto-Bulgarian</a> flavour in the church's interior and a relationship with the art of <a href="Persia">Persia</a> or <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>. Thus, he believes that it is not based on Byzantine examples of that age. Of a contrary opinion is Miyatev, who points out significant similarities between the decoration of the Round Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (now part of the <a href="Fenari%20Isa%20Mosque">Fenari Isa Mosque</a>) from 908 in Constantinople. Mavrodinov goes a step further to claim that the architect of the Round Church was directly inspired by ancient examples, citing in particular the rich sculptural decoration.

The Round Church was unmatched in its ceramic decoration by any church in Preslav, and was the only known building in the city to rely heavily on polychrome ceramic tiles. Ceramic and mosaic <a href="icon">icon</a>s were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are <a href="Charalampus">Charalampus</a> and perhaps <a href="Joel%20%28prophet%29">Joel</a>. Some of the images were enclosed in <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>s.

The Round Church featured marble and limestone cornices. These included a large number of intertwined <a href="Ornament%20%28architecture%29">ornaments</a> and details, such as <a href="palmette">palmette</a>s, <a href="grape">grape</a> clusters, leaves, and <a href="chamfer">chamfer</a>s. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the cornices feature some that are entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the cornices. Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to <a href="geometry">geometric</a> shapes and floral motifs, all <a href="glazing%20%28window%29">glazed</a> in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.

The Round Church contains many medieval inscriptions, both official and scratched on its walls as <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>. One study counted a total of 193 signs and 30 drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of <a href="Christian%20symbolism">Christian symbolism</a>. As a whole, the <a href="epigraphy">epigraphy</a> of the Round Church dates from the 10th century, and three alphabets are represented: the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek</a>, the <a href="Glagolitic%20alphabet">Glagolitic</a>, and the <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic</a>, as well as two languages: <a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a> and Old Bulgarian (the eastern <a href="History%20of%20the%20Bulgarian%20language%23Old%20Bulgarian">Bulgarian recension</a> of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic inscriptions of the Round Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.

Perhaps the most famous and valuable writing on the walls of the church is a Cyrillic inscription on the south wall of the premises south of the narthex, conventionally known as the baptistery. The inscription was clumsily written on top of a mortar <a href="putty">putty</a> and says in translation: "Church of Saint John, built by <a href="chartophylax">chartophylax</a> Paul". Despite being dated to the 10th century and its mention of the church's dedication and its potential donor, it cannot be described a classic donor's inscription because of its unnatural location and clumsy writing. Nikolova considers it more likely that the author of the inscription was a literate person who served under chartophylax Paul and desired to spread his fame. She believes the text may refer to the construction of the narthex only rather than the whole church, because she is of the opinion that the narthex may have been added after the building of the rotunda.

Other examples of the epigraphy of the Round Church include several short Glagolitic and Cyrillic texts and separate letters. Among the Glagolitic inscriptions is the Preslav <a href="Abecedarium">Abecedarium</a>, a liturgical text including the first thirteen letters of that alphabet; some of the Cyrillic texts were written on ceramic tiles. The names and descriptions attached to the icons are in Greek, while there are also bilingual inscriptions in Greek and Bulgarian. Individual letters inscribed on the walls illustrate the way Greek and simplified Glagolitic letterforms were combined to form the early Cyrillic alphabet. On the walls of the church are graffiti of <a href="Christian%20cross">Christian cross</a>es, animals, and up to 11 depictions of ships. At least one <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> has been discovered, inscribed on the tombstone of a woman described as "God's servant Tudora".

Chaplain–Medic massacre

The Chaplain–Medic massacre was a massacre that took place in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> on July 16, 1950, on a mountain above the village of Tuman, South Korea. Thirty unarmed, critically wounded <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> soldiers and an unarmed <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a> were murdered by members of the <a href="Korean%20People%27s%20Army">North Korean army</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Taejon">Battle of Taejon</a>.

Operating at the <a href="Kum%20River">Kum River</a> during the Battle of Taejon, troops of the U.S. Army's <a href="19th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">19th Infantry Regiment</a>, <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">24th Infantry Division</a>, were cut off from resupply by a <a href="roadblock">roadblock</a> established by North Korean troops of the <a href="NK%203rd%20Division">NK 3rd Division</a>. The roadblock proved difficult to break, and forced U.S. troops to move through nearby mountains to evacuate their wounded.

Thirty critically wounded U.S. troops were stranded at the top of a mountain. Attended to by only two <a href="non-combatant">non-combatant</a>s, a <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a> and a <a href="medic">medic</a>, the wounded were discovered by a North Korean patrol. Though the medic was able to escape, the North Koreans executed the unarmed chaplain as he prayed over the wounded, then killed the rest of them. The massacre was one of several incidents that led U.S. commanders to establish a commission in July to look into war crimes during the war. The same month, the North Korean commanders, concerned about the way their soldiers were treating <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>, laid out stricter guidelines for handling enemy captives. Other than this change, the historiography of the incident in North Korean sources is largely unknown; as a result, sources detailing the incident are almost exclusively from the United States and other United Nations allies.

Following the invasion of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea">Republic of Korea</a> (South Korea) by its northern neighbor, the <a href="Democratic%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Korea">Democratic People's Republic of Korea</a> (North Korea), the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> committed troops to the conflict to prevent the collapse of the South Korean state. However, the number of U.S. forces in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> available to support this effort had been steadily decreasing since the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, five years earlier. The closest U.S. division, the <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">24th Infantry Division</a> of the <a href="Eighth%20United%20States%20Army">Eighth United States Army</a>, headquartered in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to <a href="Louis%20A.%20Johnson%23Defense%20budget%20reductions">defense cutbacks</a> enacted in the first <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman%23Defense%20cutbacks">Truman administration</a>. Nevertheless, the 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea to absorb the initial "shock" of North Korean advances and to buy time for the deployment of additional forces, such as the <a href="7th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">7th Infantry Division</a>, <a href="25th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">25th Infantry Division</a>, <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Cavalry Division</a>, <a href="1st%20Provisional%20Marine%20Brigade%23Korean%20War">1st Provisional Marine Brigade</a> and other Eighth Army supporting units.

Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Osan">Battle of Osan</a> on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces. The force at the battle, Task Force Smith, retreated from Osan, and U.S. forces were again defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pyongtaek">Battle of Pyongtaek</a>. For over a week after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force's superior numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south at and around <a href="Battle%20of%20Chochiwon">Chochiwon</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Chonan">Chonan</a>, Pyongtaek, <a href="Hadong%20Ambush">Hadong</a>, and <a href="Yechon">Yechon</a>. These American soldiers, most of whom had experienced only occupation duty in Japan and no actual combat, were unprepared compared to the more disciplined North Korean units.

On July 12, the division's commander, <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="William%20F.%20Dean">William F. Dean</a>, ordered the division's <a href="19th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">19th</a>, <a href="21st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">21st</a>, and <a href="34th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">34th Infantry Regiments</a> to cross the Kum River, destroying all bridges behind them, and to establish defensive positions around Taejon. Taejon was a major South Korean city south of Seoul and northwest of <a href="Pusan">Pusan</a>, and was the site of the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters. Dean formed a line with the 34th Infantry and 19th Infantry facing east, and held the heavily battered 21st Infantry in reserve to the southeast. The Kum River wrapped north and west around the city, providing a defensive line 10 to 15 miles from the outskirts of Taejon, which is protected on the south by the <a href="Sobaek%20Mountains">Sobaek Mountains</a>. With major railroad lines and roads emanating in all directions, Taejon stood as a major transportation hub between Seoul and <a href="Taegu">Taegu</a>, giving it great strategic value for both the American and North Korean forces. Taejon had to be held to stop the North Korean forces from converging on the unfinished defensive lines around Pusan.

Following an initial penetration to the north, the retreating 34th Infantry moved south to <a href="Nonsan">Nonsan</a>. On July 15, the 19th Infantry moved its 2nd Battalion to fill some of the gaps left by the 34th. There, it was reinforced by troops from the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20Army">Republic of Korea Army</a>. The combined forces observed a large build-up of North Korean troops on the west side of the river. At 03:00 on July 16, the North Koreans launched a massive barrage of tank, artillery and mortar fire on the 19th Infantry positions and North Korean troops began to cross the river in boats. The North Korean forces gathered on the west bank and assaulted the positions of the 1st Battalion's C and E Companies, followed by a second landing against B Company. North Korean forces pushed against the entire battalion, threatening to overwhelm it. The regimental commander ordered all support troops and officers to the line and they were able to repulse the assault. However, in the melee, North Korean forces infiltrated their rear elements, attacking the reserve forces and blocking supply lines. Stretched thin, the 19th Infantry was unable to hold the line at the Kum River and simultaneously repel the North Korean forces.

North Korean troops promptly set up a roadblock directly behind the 19th Infantry's line in its main route of supply along the road near the village of Tuman, just south of <a href="Yusong">Yusong</a> on Taejon's western outskirts. The roadblock quickly became a serious problem for U.S. forces trying to move ammunition and wounded to and from the Kum River line. Around 13:00 on July 16, the 19th Infantry Regimental commander contacted Dean, who ordered him to break the roadblock. However, North Korean troops had set up at least six machine-gun nests above the road at Tuman, and repeated attacks against it were unable to drive the North Korean troops away.

The roadblock was preventing evacuation of the wounded. Troops attempted to drive wounded in jeeps through the roadblock, but this exposed them to machine-gun fire. By 16:00 supply columns were also piling up at the block, unable to proceed as armor and airstrikes attempted to dislodge the North Koreans. Five hundred men from the regiment were gathered waiting to break the roadblock while heavy armor units from Taejon moved against it from the other side. During this time, U.S. troops from the 19th Infantry, desperate to move around the roadblock to obtain supplies and care for wounded, began moving through the surrounding hills. One tank was able to make it through the roadblock to evacuate the 19th Infantry's wounded commander, but by 19:00 commanders ordered the regiment to move its wounded along the ridges to the east of the roadblock.

At 21:00, about 100 men of the 19th Infantry moved into the hills to the east of the town. They carried with them about 30 wounded, including several <a href="Litter%20%28rescue%20basket%29">litter</a>-bound patients too seriously wounded to walk. Some of the group of 100 were ordered to carry these men, but many of them separated from the group in the mountains. By the time they reached the top of the mountain, officers decided some of the seriously wounded could not be carried any further, as their carriers were exhausted. The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and Chaplain <a href="Herman%20G.%20Felhoelter">Herman G. Felhoelter</a> remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them. Buttrey wore a <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> <a href="brassard">brassard</a> identifying him as a medic, while Felhoelter wore a large white <a href="Latin%20cross">Latin cross</a> brassard, identifying him as a <a href="military%20chaplain">military chaplain</a> in the <a href="Chaplain%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">U.S. Army Chaplain Corps</a>. The two who remained and the wounded were <a href="non-combatants">non-combatants</a> under international law, as they carried no weapons.

Soon after, Buttrey and Felhoelter heard a North Korean patrol approaching, a group of men from the <a href="NK%203rd%20Division">North Korean 3rd Division</a> which had infiltrated the U.S. lines. Felhoelter told Buttrey to escape, and although Buttrey was shot and severely wounded in the ankle by North Korean fire while running, he was able to get away. Felhoelter then began administering <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a> and <a href="extreme%20unction">extreme unction</a> to the wounded as they lay on their litters. From this point, observers from the 19th Infantry's regimental <a href="Headquarters%20and%20Headquarters%20Company">Headquarters and Headquarters Company</a> watched through binoculars from a distance as a patrol of young-looking and possibly untrained North Korean troops approached the site of the wounded. The troops were armed with Soviet-made rifles and <a href="PPSh-41">PPSh-41 "burp guns"</a>. As Felhoelter knelt to pray over the wounded U.S. soldiers, the North Korean troops shot him in the head and back. They then proceeded to shoot and kill all of the 30 critically wounded soldiers with their automatic weapons before withdrawing into the wilderness.

American troops were able to recover the bodies of only three of the victims of the massacre, including Father Felhoelter, due to the chaos of the battle and subsequent American withdrawal, and were unable to capture any North Korean troops who participated in the massacre. For his actions in volunteering to stay behind with the wounded, Father Felhoelter was <a href="Posthumous%20recognition">posthumously</a> awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, the second highest decoration for valor awarded by the U.S. military. His remains were returned to the United States and he's buried in St. Michael's Century, Louisville. He was the first chaplain of the war to receive an award for valor. He received a brief obituary in <a href="Time%20Magazine">"Time" Magazine</a> in December 1952. Felhoelter was the first of twelve chaplains killed or missing at that point in the war, including <a href="Emil%20J.%20Kapaun">Emil J. Kapaun</a>, the second chaplain of the war to be awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.

The incident would be one of the first of a series of atrocities the U.S. forces accused North Korean soldiers of committing. After the Chaplain–Medic, <a href="Hill%20303">Hill 303</a> and <a href="Bloody%20Gulch%20massacre">Bloody Gulch</a> massacres, U.S. commanders established a commission on July 27 to investigate allegations of war crimes and collect evidence.

In late 1953, the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Government%20Operations">United States Senate Committee on Government Operations</a>, led by <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a>, conducted an investigation of up to 1,800 reported incidents of war crimes allegedly committed throughout the Korean War. The Chaplain–Medic massacre was one of the first to be investigated, and it was here that the incident got its name. Buttrey, the lone survivor of the executions, was called to testify before the committee, and the U.S. Government concluded that the North Korean army violated the terms of the <a href="Geneva%20Convention">Geneva Convention</a>, and condemned its actions.

In 1981, the United States erected a series of monuments in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a>, listing the names of chaplains killed in various wars including World War II, the Korean War and the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Felhoelter's name was among those engraved in the memorial.

Generally subsequent research has found the North Korean command did not directly order its troops to mistreat prisoners or unarmed wounded during the early phase of the war. The Chaplain–Medic massacre and similar atrocities are believed to have been conducted by "uncontrolled small units, by vindictive individuals, or because of unfavorable and increasingly desperate situations confronting the captors". The more North Korean troops suffered from worsening conditions on the front lines, the more they mistreated American wounded and prisoners. <a href="T.%20R.%20Fehrenbach">T. R. Fehrenbach</a>, a military historian, wrote in his analysis of the event that North Korean troops committing these acts were probably accustomed to torture and execution of prisoners due to decades of rule by oppressive armies of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> up until World War II.

A July 28, 1950, order by General Lee Yong Ho, commander of the North Korean 3rd Division, was intercepted by UN intelligence. The document was signed by <a href="Kim%20Chaek">Kim Chaek</a>, Commander-in-Chief, and <a href="Choe%20Yong-gon%20%28army%20commander%29">Choi Yong-kun</a>, commander of the Advanced General Headquarters of the North Korean Army, and stated that killing prisoners of war was "strictly prohibited". Lee directed individual units' <a href="Political%20commissar">Cultural Sections</a> to inform the division's troops of the rule. The higher-profile <a href="Hill%20303%20massacre">Hill 303 massacre</a> the next month prompted North Korean division commanders to issue sterner orders on the treatment of prisoners of war.

RNA interference

RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which <a href="RNA">RNA</a> molecules <a href="regulation%20of%20gene%20expression">inhibit gene expression</a> or translation, by neutralizing targeted <a href="mRNA">mRNA</a> molecules. Historically, RNAi was known by other names, including "co-suppression", "post-transcriptional gene silencing" (PTGS), and "quelling". The detailed study of each of these seemingly different processes elucidated that the identity of these phenomena were all actually RNAi. <a href="Andrew%20Fire">Andrew Fire</a> and <a href="Craig%20C.%20Mello">Craig C. Mello</a> shared the 2006 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for their work on RNA interference in the <a href="nematode">nematode</a> worm "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">Caenorhabditis elegans</a>", which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi is now known as precise, efficient, stable and better than antisense technology for gene suppression. However, antisense RNA produced intracellularly by an expression vector may be developed and find utility as novel therapeutic agents.

Two types of small <a href="ribonucleic%20acid">ribonucleic acid</a> (RNA) molecules – <a href="microRNA">microRNA</a> (miRNA) and <a href="small%20interfering%20RNA">small interfering RNA</a> (<a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>) – are central to RNA interference. RNAs are the direct products of genes, and these small RNAs can direct enzyme complexes to degrade <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA) molecules and thus decrease their activity by preventing translation, via post-transcriptional gene silencing. Moreover, transcription can be inhibited via the pre-transcriptional silencing mechanism of RNA interference, through which an enzyme complex catalyzes DNA methylation at genomic positions complementary to complexed siRNA or miRNA. RNA interference has an important role in defending cells against parasitic <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> sequences – <a href="virus">virus</a>es and <a href="transposon">transposon</a>s. It also influences <a href="developmental%20biology">development</a>.

The RNAi pathway is found in many <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s, including animals, and is initiated by the enzyme <a href="Dicer">Dicer</a>, which cleaves long <a href="double-stranded%20RNA">double-stranded RNA</a> (dsRNA) <a href="molecules">molecules</a> into short double-stranded fragments of ~21 <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s. Each <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the <a href="RNA-induced%20silencing%20complex">RNA-induced silencing complex</a> (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by <a href="Argonaute">Argonaute</a> 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the <a href="RNA-induced%20silencing%20complex">RISC</a>. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>.

RNAi is a valuable research tool, both in <a href="cell%20culture">cell culture</a> and in <a href="living%20organism">living organism</a>s, because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi may be used for large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a>. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, <a href="medicine">medicine</a> and <a href="insecticides">insecticides</a>.

RNAi is RNA-dependent <a href="gene%20silencing">gene silencing</a> process that is controlled by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's cytoplasm, where they interact with the catalytic RISC component <a href="argonaute">argonaute</a>. When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> and cleaved to short fragments by Dicer. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-microRNAs expressed from <a href="non-coding%20RNA">RNA-coding gene</a>s in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic <a href="stem-loop">stem-loop</a> structure of pre-miRNA in the <a href="cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a>, then exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC.

Exogenous dsRNA initiates RNAi by activating the <a href="ribonuclease">ribonuclease</a> protein Dicer, which binds and cleaves double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in plants, or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in humans, to produce double-stranded fragments of 20–25 <a href="base%20pair">base pair</a>s with a 2-nucleotide overhang at the 3' end. <a href="Bioinformatics">Bioinformatics</a> studies on the genomes of multiple organisms suggest this length maximizes target-gene specificity and minimizes non-specific effects. These short double-stranded fragments are called small interfering RNAs (<a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s). These <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s are then separated into single strands and integrated into an active RISC, by RISC-Loading Complex (RLC). RLC includes Dicer-2 and R2D2, and is crucial to unite Ago2 and RISC. TATA-binding protein-associated factor 11 (TAF11) assembles the RLC by facilitating Dcr-2-R2D2 tetramerization, which increases the binding affinity to siRNA by 10-fold. Association with TAF11 would convert the R2-D2-Initiator (RDI) complex into the RLC. R2D2 carries tandem double-stranded RNA-binding domains to recognize the thermodynamically stable terminus of <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> duplexes, whereas Dicer-2 the other less stable extremity. Loading is asymmetric: the MID domain of Ago2 recognizes the thermodynamically stable end of the siRNA. Therefore, the "passenger" (sense) strand whose 5′ end is discarded by MID is ejected, while the saved "guide" (antisense) strand cooperates with AGO to form the RISC.

After integration into the RISC, <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from being used as a <a href="translation%20%28genetics%29">translation</a> template. Differently from <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.

Exogenous dsRNA is detected and bound by an effector protein, known as RDE-4 in "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">C. elegans</a>" and R2D2 in "<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>", that stimulates dicer activity. The mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown and this protein only binds long dsRNAs.

In "C. elegans" this initiation response is amplified through the synthesis of a population of 'secondary' <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s during which the dicer-produced initiating or 'primary' <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s are used as templates. These 'secondary' <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s are structurally distinct from dicer-produced <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s and appear to be produced by an <a href="RNA-dependent%20RNA%20polymerase">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</a> (RdRP).

<a href="MicroRNA">MicroRNA</a>s (miRNAs) are <a href="genome">genomically</a> encoded <a href="non-coding%20RNA">non-coding RNA</a>s that help regulate <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>, particularly during <a href="developmental%20biology">development</a>. The phenomenon of RNA interference, broadly defined, includes the endogenously induced gene silencing effects of miRNAs as well as silencing triggered by foreign dsRNA. Mature miRNAs are structurally similar to <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s produced from exogenous dsRNA, but before reaching maturity, miRNAs must first undergo extensive <a href="post-transcriptional%20modification">post-transcriptional modification</a>. A miRNA is expressed from a much longer RNA-coding gene as a <a href="primary%20transcript">primary transcript</a> known as a "pri-miRNA" which is processed, in the <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a>, to a 70-nucleotide <a href="stem-loop">stem-loop</a> structure called a "pre-miRNA" by the <a href="microprocessor%20complex">microprocessor complex</a>. This complex consists of an <a href="RNase%20III">RNase III</a> enzyme called <a href="Drosha">Drosha</a> and a dsRNA-binding protein <a href="DGCR8">DGCR8</a>. The dsRNA portion of this pre-miRNA is bound and cleaved by Dicer to produce the mature miRNA molecule that can be integrated into the RISC complex; thus, miRNA and <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> share the same downstream cellular machinery. First, viral encoded miRNA was described in EBV. Thereafter, an increasing number of microRNAs have been described in viruses. VIRmiRNA is a comprehensive catalogue covering viral microRNA, their targets and anti-viral miRNAs (see also VIRmiRNA resource: <a href="http%3A//crdd.osdd.net/servers/virmirna/">http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/virmirna/).</a>

<a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s derived from long dsRNA precursors differ from miRNAs in that miRNAs, especially those in animals, typically have incomplete base pairing to a target and inhibit the translation of many different mRNAs with similar sequences. In contrast, <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s typically base-pair perfectly and induce mRNA cleavage only in a single, specific target. In "<a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">Drosophila</a>" and "C. elegans", miRNA and <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> are processed by distinct argonaute proteins and dicer enzymes.

<a href="Three%20prime%20untranslated%20region">Three prime untranslated region</a>s (3'UTRs) of <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a>s (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding sites for <a href="microRNA">microRNA</a>s (miRNAs) as well as for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.

The 3'-UTR often contains <a href="Three%20prime%20untranslated%20region%23MicroRNA%20responseelements">microRNA response elements (MREs)</a>. MREs are sequences to which miRNAs bind. These are prevalent motifs within 3'-UTRs. Among all regulatory motifs within the 3'-UTRs (e.g. including silencer regions), MREs make up about half of the motifs.

As of 2014, the <a href="miRBase">miRBase</a> web site, an archive of <a href="microRNA">miRNA</a> <a href="Sequence%20%28biology%29">sequences</a> and annotations, listed 28,645 entries in 233 biologic species. Of these, 1,881 miRNAs were in annotated human miRNA loci. miRNAs were predicted to have an average of about four hundred target <a href="messenger%20RNA">mRNAs</a> (affecting expression of several hundred genes). Friedman et al. estimate that >45,000 miRNA target sites within human mRNA 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and >60% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs.

Direct experiments show that a single miRNA can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique mRNAs. Other experiments show that a single miRNA may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (less than 2-fold).

The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression seem to be important in cancer. For instance, in gastrointestinal cancers, nine miRNAs have been identified as <a href="Epigenetics">epigenetically</a> altered and effective in down regulating DNA repair enzymes.

The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorders.

Exogenous dsRNA is detected and bound by an effector protein, known as RDE-4 in "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">C. elegans</a>" and R2D2 in "<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>", that stimulates dicer activity. This protein only binds long dsRNAs, but the mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown. This RNA-binding protein then facilitates the transfer of cleaved <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s to the RISC complex.

In "C. elegans" this initiation response is amplified through the synthesis of a population of 'secondary' <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s during which the dicer-produced initiating or 'primary' <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s are used as templates. These 'secondary' <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s are structurally distinct from dicer-produced <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s and appear to be produced by an <a href="RNA-dependent%20RNA%20polymerase">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</a> (RdRP).
The active components of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are <a href="endonuclease">endonuclease</a>s called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand <a href="complementarity%20%28molecular%20biology%29">complementary</a> to their bound <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>. However, only one of the two strands, which is known as the "guide strand", binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other "anti-guide strand" or "passenger strand" is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>-dependent <a href="helicase">helicase</a> separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an "in vitro" kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose <a href="5%27%20end">5' end</a> is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.

The structural basis for binding of RNA to the argonaute protein was examined by <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> of the binding <a href="structural%20domain">domain</a> of an RNA-bound argonaute protein. Here, the <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylated</a> 5' end of the RNA strand enters a <a href="Conserved%20sequence">conserved</a> <a href="basicity">basic</a> surface <a href="binding%20site">pocket</a> and makes contacts through a <a href="divalent">divalent</a> <a href="cation">cation</a> (an atom with two positive charges) such as <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> and by <a href="aromaticity">aromatic</a> <a href="stacking%20%28chemistry%29">stacking</a> (a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing it back and forth) between the 5' nucleotide in the <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> and a conserved <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a> residue. This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> to its mRNA target. Analysis of the inhibitory effect of mismatches in either the 5’ or 3’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA, while the 3’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage-favorable RISC region.

It is not understood how the activated RISC complex locates complementary mRNAs within the cell. Although the cleavage process has been proposed to be linked to <a href="translation%20%28genetics%29">translation</a>, translation of the mRNA target is not essential for RNAi-mediated degradation. Indeed, RNAi may be more effective against mRNA targets that are not translated. Argonaute proteins are localized to specific regions in the cytoplasm called <a href="P-bodies">P-bodies</a> (also cytoplasmic bodies or GW bodies), which are regions with high rates of mRNA decay; miRNA activity is also clustered in P-bodies. Disruption of P-bodies decreases the efficiency of RNA interference, suggesting that they are a critical site in the RNAi process.

Components of the RNAi pathway are used in many eukaryotes in the maintenance of the organization and structure of their <a href="genome">genome</a>s. Modification of <a href="histone">histone</a>s and associated induction of <a href="heterochromatin">heterochromatin</a> formation serves to downregulate genes pre-<a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcriptionally</a>; this process is referred to as <a href="RNA-induced%20transcriptional%20silencing">RNA-induced transcriptional silencing</a> (RITS), and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex. In <a href="fission%20yeast">fission yeast</a> this complex contains argonaute, a <a href="chromodomain">chromodomain</a> protein Chp1, and a protein called Tas3 of unknown function. As a consequence, the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins. Indeed, deletion of these genes in the fission yeast "<a href="Schizosaccharomyces%20pombe">S. pombe</a>" disrupts <a href="histone%20methylation">histone methylation</a> and <a href="centromere">centromere</a> formation, causing slow or stalled <a href="anaphase">anaphase</a> during <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a>. In some cases, similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes.

The mechanism by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most studies have focused on the <a href="mating-type%20region">mating-type region</a> in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s <a href="complementarity%20%28molecular%20biology%29">complementary</a> to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a>. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.

The type of <a href="RNA%20editing">RNA editing</a> that is most prevalent in higher eukaryotes converts <a href="adenosine">adenosine</a> nucleotides into <a href="inosine">inosine</a> in dsRNAs via the enzyme <a href="adenosine%20deaminase">adenosine deaminase</a> (ADAR). It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A→I RNA editing pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate. Some pre-miRNAs do undergo A→I RNA editing and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, at least one mammalian ADAR can sequester <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s from RNAi pathway components. Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR-null "C. elegans" strains indicating that A→I RNA editing may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.

Organisms vary in their ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA interference can be both systemic and heritable in plants and "C. elegans", although not in "Drosophila" or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s between cells through <a href="plasmodesmata">plasmodesmata</a> (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from <a href="DNA%20methylation">methylation</a> of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation <a href="eukaryotic%20initiation%20factor">initiation factor</a>s with the messenger RNA's <a href="polyadenylation">polyadenine tail</a>.

Some eukaryotic <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a> such as "<a href="Leishmania%20major">Leishmania major</a>" and "<a href="Trypanosoma%20cruzi">Trypanosoma cruzi</a>" lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most or all of the components are also missing in some <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, most notably the <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a> "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>". The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as "<a href="Saccharomyces%20castellii">Saccharomyces castellii</a>" and "<a href="Candida%20albicans">Candida albicans</a>", further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from "S. castellii" facilitates RNAi in "S. cerevisiae". That certain <a href="ascomycete">ascomycete</a>s and <a href="basidiomycete">basidiomycete</a>s are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a>, possibly due to the evolution of a novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack of selective advantage in certain <a href="Ecological%20niche">niche</a>s.

Gene expression in prokaryotes is influenced by an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not generally considered to be analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that <a href="CRISPR%20interference">CRISPR interference</a> systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">orthologous</a>.

RNA interference is a vital part of the <a href="immune%20response">immune response</a> to viruses and other foreign <a href="genes">genetic material</a>, especially in plants where it may also prevent the self-propagation of transposons. Plants such as "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" express multiple dicer <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">homologs</a> that are specialized to react differently when the plant is exposed to different viruses. Even before the RNAi pathway was fully understood, it was known that induced gene silencing in plants could spread throughout the plant in a systemic effect and could be transferred from stock to <a href="scion%20%28grafting%29">scion</a> plants via <a href="grafting">grafting</a>. This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized encounter. In response, many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to suppress the RNAi response. These include viral proteins that bind short double-stranded RNA fragments with single-stranded overhang ends, such as those produced by dicer. Some plant genomes also express endogenous <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s in response to infection by specific types of <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>. These effects may be part of a generalized response to pathogens that downregulates any metabolic process in the host that aids the infection process.

Although animals generally express fewer variants of the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult "Drosophila", RNA interference is important in antiviral <a href="innate%20immunity">innate immunity</a> and is active against pathogens such as <a href="Drosophila%20X%20virus">Drosophila X virus</a>. A similar role in immunity may operate in "C. elegans", as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.

The role of RNA interference in mammalian innate immunity is poorly understood, and relatively little data is available. However, the existence of viruses that encode genes able to suppress the RNAi response in mammalian cells may be evidence in favour of an RNAi-dependent mammalian immune response, although this hypothesis has been challenged as poorly substantiated.
Evidence for the existence of a functional antiviral RNAi pathway in mammalian cells has been presented.

Other functions for RNAi in mammalian viruses also exist, such as miRNAs expressed by the <a href="Herpes%20simplex%20virus">herpes virus</a> that may act as <a href="heterochromatin">heterochromatin</a> organization triggers to mediate viral latency.

Endogenously expressed miRNAs, including both <a href="intron">intron</a>ic and <a href="intergenic%20region">intergenic</a> miRNAs, are most important in translational repression and in the regulation of development, especially on the timing of <a href="morphogenesis">morphogenesis</a> and the maintenance of <a href="cell%20differentiation">undifferentiated</a> or incompletely differentiated cell types such as <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a>s. The role of endogenously expressed miRNA in downregulating <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> was first described in "C. elegans" in 1993. In plants this function was discovered when the "JAW microRNA" of "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis</a>" was shown to be involved in the regulation of several genes that control plant shape. In plants, the majority of genes regulated by miRNAs are <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>s; thus miRNA activity is particularly wide-ranging and regulates entire <a href="gene%20network">gene network</a>s during development by modulating the expression of key regulatory genes, including transcription factors as well as <a href="F-box%20protein">F-box protein</a>s. In many organisms, including humans, miRNAs are linked to the formation of <a href="tumor">tumor</a>s and dysregulation of the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a>. Here, miRNAs can function as both <a href="oncogene">oncogene</a>s and <a href="tumor%20suppressor">tumor suppressor</a>s.

RNA sequences (<a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> and miRNA) that are complementary to parts of a promoter can increase gene transcription, a phenomenon dubbed <a href="RNAa">RNA activation</a>. Part of the mechanism for how these RNA upregulate genes is known: dicer and argonaute are involved, possibly via histone demethylation. miRNAs have been proposed to upregulate their target genes upon cell cycle arrest, via unknown mechanisms.

Based on <a href="computational%20phylogenetics%23Maximum%20parsimony">parsimony-based</a> <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis, the <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> of all <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway; the absence of the pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic. This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one dicer-like protein, one argonaute, one <a href="PIWI%20protein">PIWI protein</a>, and an <a href="RNA-dependent%20RNA%20polymerase">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</a> that may also have played other cellular roles. A large-scale <a href="comparative%20genomics">comparative genomics</a> study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic <a href="crown%20group">crown group</a> already possessed these components, which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the <a href="Exosome%20complex">exosome</a>. This study also suggests that the RNA-binding argonaute protein family, which is shared among eukaryotes, most archaea, and at least some bacteria (such as "<a href="Aquifex%20aeolicus">Aquifex aeolicus</a>"), is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the <a href="translation%20%28genetics%29">translation initiation</a> system.

The ancestral function of the RNAi system is generally agreed to have been immune defense against exogenous genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes. Related functions such as histone modification may have already been present in the ancestor of modern eukaryotes, although other functions such as regulation of development by miRNA are thought to have evolved later.

RNA interference genes, as components of the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an <a href="evolutionary%20arms%20race">evolutionary arms race</a> with viral genes. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms for suppressing the RNAi response in their host cells, particularly for plant viruses. Studies of evolutionary rates in "Drosophila" have shown that genes in the RNAi pathway are subject to strong <a href="directional%20selection">directional selection</a> and are among the fastest-<a href="evolution">evolving</a> genes in the "Drosophila" genome.

The RNA interference pathway is often exploited in <a href="experimental%20biology">experimental biology</a> to study the function of genes in <a href="cell%20culture">cell culture</a> and "<a href="in%20vivo">in vivo</a>" in <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>s. Double-stranded RNA is synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest and introduced into a cell or organism, where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway. Using this mechanism, researchers can cause a drastic decrease in the expression of a targeted gene. Studying the effects of this decrease can show the physiological role of the gene product. Since RNAi may not totally abolish expression of the gene, this technique is sometimes referred as a "<a href="Gene%20knockdown">knockdown</a>", to distinguish it from "<a href="Gene%20knockout">knockout</a>" procedures in which expression of a gene is entirely eliminated. In a recent study validation of RNAi silencing efficiency using gene array data showed 18.5% failure rate across 429 independent experiments.

Extensive efforts in <a href="computational%20biology">computational biology</a> have been directed toward the design of successful dsRNA reagents that maximize gene knockdown but minimize "off-target" effects. Off-target effects arise when an introduced RNA has a base sequence that can pair with and thus reduce the expression of multiple genes. Such problems occur more frequently when the dsRNA contains repetitive sequences. It has been estimated from studying the genomes of humans, "C. elegans" and "<a href="Schizosaccharomyces%20pombe">S. pombe</a>" that about 10% of possible <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s have substantial off-target effects. A multitude of software tools have been developed implementing <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s for the design of general mammal-specific, and virus-specific <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s that are automatically checked for possible cross-reactivity.

Depending on the organism and experimental system, the exogenous RNA may be a long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> substrates. In most mammalian cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules induce the mammalian <a href="interferon">interferon</a> response, a form of <a href="innate%20immunity">innate immunity</a> that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse <a href="oocyte">oocyte</a>s and cells from early mouse <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA and are therefore a common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>, for example, by stable <a href="transfection">transfection</a> with a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> encoding the appropriate sequence from which <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a>s can be transcribed, or by more elaborate <a href="lentivirus">lentiviral</a> vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription, known as "conditional RNAi".

Most <a href="functional%20genomics">functional genomics</a> applications of RNAi in animals have used "C. elegans" and "Drosophila", as these are the common <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>s in which RNAi is most effective. "C. elegans" is particularly useful for RNAi research for two reasons: firstly, the effects of gene silencing are generally heritable, and secondly because delivery of the dsRNA is extremely simple. Through a mechanism whose details are poorly understood, bacteria such as "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" that carry the desired dsRNA can be fed to the worms and will transfer their RNA payload to the worm via the intestinal tract. This "delivery by feeding" is just as effective at inducing gene silencing as more costly and time-consuming delivery methods, such as soaking the worms in dsRNA solution and injecting dsRNA into the gonads. Although delivery is more difficult in most other organisms, efforts are also underway to undertake large-scale genomic screening applications in cell culture with mammalian cells.

Approaches to the design of genome-wide RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> for a defined set of experimental conditions. <a href="Artificial%20neural%20network">Artificial neural network</a>s are frequently used to design <a href="Small%20interfering%20RNA">siRNA</a> libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for <a href="genome%20annotation">genome annotation</a> and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on <a href="microarray">microarray</a>s. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from "C. elegans" to related parasitic nematodes.

Functional genomics using RNAi is a particularly attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are <a href="polyploid">polyploid</a>, which presents substantial challenges for more traditional genetic engineering methods. For example, RNAi has been successfully used for functional genomics studies in <a href="Triticum%20aestivum">bread wheat</a> (which is hexaploid) as well as more common plant model systems "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis</a>" and <a href="maize">maize</a>.

History of RNAi use in medicine

The first instance of <a href="RNA">RNA</a> silencing in animals was documented in 1996, when Guo and Kemphues observed that, by introducing <a href="Sense%20strand">sense</a> and <a href="antisense%20RNA">antisense RNA</a> to par-1 mRNA in <a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">Caenorhabditis elegans</a> caused degradation of the par-1 message. It was thought that this degradation was triggered by single stranded RNA (ssRNA), but two years later, in 1998, Fire and Mello discovered that this ability to silence the par-1 gene expression was actually triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). They would eventually share the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for this discovery. Just after Fire and Mello's ground-breaking discovery, Elbashir et al. discovered, by using synthetically made <a href="small%20interfering%20RNA">small interfering RNA</a> (siRNA), it was possible to target the silencing of specific sequences in a gene, rather than silencing the entire gene. Only a year later, McCaffrey and colleagues demonstrated that this sequence specific silencing had therapeutic applications by targeting a sequence from the <a href="Hepatitis%20C">Hepatitis C</a> virus in <a href="Transgenesis">transgenic</a> mice. Since then, multiple researchers have been attempting to expand the therapeutic applications of RNAi, specifically looking to target genes that cause various types of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>. Finally, in 2004, this new gene silencing technology entered a <a href="Phases%20of%20clinical%20research">Phase I clinical trial</a> in humans for wet age-related <a href="macular%20degeneration">macular degeneration</a>. Six years later the first-in-human Phase I clinical trial was started, using a <a href="Targeted%20drug%20delivery">nanoparticle delivery system</a> to target <a href="Neoplasm">solid tumors</a>. Although most research is currently looking into the applications of RNAi in cancer treatment, the list of possible applications is extensive. RNAi could potentially be used to treat <a href="virus">virus</a>es, <a href="Pathogenic%20bacteria">bacterial diseases</a>, <a href="Human%20parasite">parasites</a>, <a href="Maladaptation">maladaptive</a> <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s, <a href="Substance%20abuse">control drug consumption</a>, <a href="Pain%20management">provide pain relief</a>, and even <a href="Modulation">modulate</a> sleep.

Antiviral treatment is one of the earliest proposed RNAi-based medical applications, and two different types have been developed. The first type is to target viral RNAs. Many studies have shown that targeting viral RNAs can suppress the replication of numerous viruses, including <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, <a href="HPV">HPV</a>, <a href="hepatitis%20A">hepatitis A</a>, <a href="hepatitis%20B">hepatitis B</a>, <a href="Influenza%20virus">Influenza virus</a>, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Adenovirus and <a href="Measles%20virus">Measles virus</a>. The other strategy is to block the initial viral entries by targeting the host cell genes. For example, suppression of chemokine receptors (<a href="CXCR4">CXCR4</a> and <a href="CCR5">CCR5</a>)on host cells can prevent HIV viral entry.

While traditional <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> can effectively kill cancer cells, lack of specificity for discriminating normal cells and cancer cells in these treatments usually cause severe side effects. Numerous studies have demonstrated that RNAi can provide a more specific approach to inhibit tumor growth by targeting cancer-related genes (i.e., <a href="oncogene">oncogene</a>). It has also been proposed that RNAi can enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to <a href="List%20of%20chemotherapeutic%20agents">chemotherapeutic agents</a>, providing a combinatorial therapeutic approach with chemotherapy. Another potential RNAi-based treatment is to inhibit cell invasion and <a href="Cell%20migration">migration</a>.

RNAi strategies also show potential for treating <a href="Neurodegeneration">neurodegenerative diseases</a>. Studies in cells and in mouse have shown that specifically targeting <a href="Amyloid%20beta">Amyloid beta</a>-producing genes (e.g. BACE1 and APP) by RNAi can significantly reduced the amount of Aβ peptide which is correlated with the cause of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>. In addition, this silencing-based approaches also provide promising results in treatment of <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a> and <a href="Polyglutamine%20disease">Polyglutamine disease</a>.

To achieve the clinical potential of RNAi, siRNA must be efficiently transportated to the cells of target tissues. However, there are various barriers that must be fixed before it can be used clinically. <a href="small%20interfering%20RNA">For example, "Naked" siRNA</a> is susceptible to several obstacles that reduce its therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, once siRNA has entered the bloodstream, naked RNA can be degraded by serum nucleases and can stimulate the innate immune system. Due to its size and highly polyanionic (containing negative charges at several sites) nature, unmodified siRNA molecules cannot readily enter the cells through the cell membrane. Therefore, artificial or <a href="RNAi%20nanoparticles%20to%20target%20cancer">nanoparticle encapsulated siRNA</a> must be used. However, transporting siRNA across the cell membrane still has its own unique challenges. If siRNA is transferred across the cell membrane, unintended toxicities can occur if therapeutic doses are not optimized, and siRNAs can exhibit off-target effects (e.g. unintended downregulation of genes with <a href="complementarity%20%28molecular%20biology%29">partial sequence complementarity</a>). Even after entering the cells, repeated dosing is required since their effects are diluted at each cell division.

Compared with chemotherapy or other anti-cancer drugs, there are a lot of advantages of siRNA drug. SiRNA acts on the post-translational stage of gene expression, so it doesn’t modify or change DNA in a deleterious effect. SiRNA can also be used to produced a specific response in a certain type of way, such as by downgrading suppression of gene expression. In a single cancer cell, siRNA can cause dramatic suppression of gene expression with just several copies. This happens by silencing cancer-promoting genes with RNAi, as well as targeting an mRNA sequence.

RNAi drugs treat cancer by silencing certain cancer promoting genes. This is done by complementing the cancer genes with the RNAi, such as keeping the mRNA sequences in accordance with the RNAi drug. Ideally, RNAi is should be injected and/or chemically modified so the RNAi can reach cancer cells more efficiently. RNAi uptake and regulation is monitored by the kidneys.

The human immune system is divided into two separate branches: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is the first defense against infection and responds to pathogens in a generic fashion. On the other hand, the adaptive immune system, a system that was evolved later than the innate, is composed mainly of highly specialized B and T cells that are trained to react to specific portions of pathogenic molecules.

The challenge between old pathogens and new has helped create a system of guarded cells and particles that are called safe framework. This framework has given humans an army systems that search out and destroy invader particles, such as pathogens, microscopic organisms, parasites, and infections. The mammalian safe framework has developed to incorporate siRNA as a tool to indicate viral contamination, which has allowed siRNA is create an intense innate immune response.

siRNA is controlled by the innate immune system, which can be divided into the acute inflammatory responses and antiviral responses. The inflammatory response is created with signals from small signaling molecules, or cytokines. These include interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The innate immune system generates inflammation and antiviral responses, which cause the release pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These receptors help in labeling which pathogens are viruses, fungi, or bacteria. Moreover, the importance of siRNA and the innate immune system is to include more PRRs to help recognize different RNA structures. This makes it more likely for the siRNA to cause an immunostimulant response in the event of the pathogen.

Clinical Phase I and II studies of siRNA therapies conducted between 2015 and 2017 have demonstrated potent and durable <a href="gene%20knockdown">gene knockdown</a> in the <a href="liver">liver</a>, with some signs of clinical improvement and without unacceptable toxicity. Two Phase III studies are in progress to treat familial neurodegenerative and cardiac syndromes caused by mutations in <a href="transthyretin">transthyretin</a> (TTR). Numerous publications have shown that in vivo delivery systems are very promising and are diverse in characteristics, allowing numerous applications. The nanoparticle delivery system shows the most promise yet this method presents additional challenges in the <a href="Scale-up%20%28chemical%20engineering%29">scale-up</a> of the manufacturing process, such as the need for tightly controlled mixing processes to achieve consistent quality of the drug product. The table below shows different drugs using RNA interference and what their phases and status is in clinical trials. 

RNA interference has been used for applications in <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a> and is nearing commercialization in other fields. RNAi has resulted in the invention of novel crops such as nicotine-free tobacco, decaffeinated coffee, nutrient fortified vegetation, and hypoallergenic crops. The genetically-engineered <a href="Arctic%20apples">Arctic apples</a> received FDA approval in 2015. The apples were produced by RNAi suppression of the PPO (polyphenol oxidase) gene, making apple varieties that will not undergo browning after being sliced. PPO-silenced apples are unable to convert chlorogenic acid into the standard quinone product.

There are several opportunities for the applications of RNAi in crop science for its improvement such as stress tolerance and enhanced nutritional level. RNAi will prove its potential for inhibition of photorespiration to enhance the productivity of C3 plants. This knockdown technology may be useful in inducing early flowering, delayed ripening, delayed senescence, breaking dormancy, stress-free plants, overcoming self-sterility, etc.

RNAi has been used to genetically engineer plants to produce lower levels of natural plant toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. <a href="Cotton">Cotton</a> seeds are rich in <a href="protein%20in%20nutrition">dietary protein</a> but naturally contain the toxic <a href="terpenoid">terpenoid</a> product <a href="gossypol">gossypol</a>, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi has been used to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of <a href="delta-cadinene%20synthase">delta-cadinene synthase</a>, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production in other parts of the plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the <a href="cyanide">cyanogenic</a> natural product <a href="linamarin">linamarin</a> in <a href="cassava">cassava</a> plants.

No plant products that use RNAi-based <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> have yet exited the experimental stage. Development efforts have successfully reduced the levels of <a href="allergen">allergen</a>s in <a href="tomato">tomato</a> plants and fortification of plants such as tomatoes with dietary <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a>s. Previous commercial products, including the <a href="Flavr%20Savr">Flavr Savr</a> tomato and two <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s of <a href="Papaya%20ringspot%20virus">ringspot</a>-resistant <a href="papaya">papaya</a>, were originally developed using <a href="antisense">antisense</a> technology but likely exploited the RNAi pathway. RNAi silencing of <a href="alpha-amylase">alpha-amylase</a> have also been used to decrease <a href="Aspergillus%20flavus">Aspergillus flavus</a> fungal growth in maize which would have otherwise contaminated the kernels with dangerous <a href="aflatoxin">aflatoxin</a>s. Silencing lachrymatory factor synthase in <a href="onion">onion</a>s have produced tearless onions and RNAi has been used in BP1 genes in <a href="rapeseed">rapeseed</a>s to improve photosynthesis. SBEIIa and SBEIIb genes in wheat have been targeted in wheat in order to produce higher levels of <a href="amylose">amylose</a> in order to improve bowel function.

Another effort decreased the precursors of likely <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>s in <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> plants. Other plant traits that have been engineered in the laboratory include the production of non-<a href="narcotic">narcotic</a> natural products by the <a href="opium%20poppy">opium poppy</a> and resistance to common plant viruses.

RNAi is under development as an <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>, employing multiple approaches, including genetic engineering and topical application. Cells in the midgut of some insects take up the dsRNA molecules in the process referred to as environmental RNAi. In some insects the effect is systemic as the signal spreads throughout the insect's body (referred to as systemic RNAi).

Animals exposed to RNAi at doses millions of times higher than anticipated human exposure levels show no adverse effects.

RNAi has varying effects in different species of <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> (butterflies and moths). Possibly because their <a href="saliva">saliva</a> and gut juice is better at breaking down RNA, the <a href="Helicoverpa%20gelotopoeon">cotton bollworm</a>, the <a href="beet%20armyworm">beet armyworm</a> and the <a href="Asiatic%20rice%20borer">Asiatic rice borer</a> have so far not been proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding.

To develop resistance to RNAi, the western corn rootworm would have to change the genetic sequence of its Snf7 gene at multiple sites. Combining multiple strategies, such as engineering the protein Cry, derived from a bacterium called <a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis">Bacillus thuringiensis</a> (Bt), and RNAi in one plant delay the onset of resistance.

<a href="Transgenic%20crops">Transgenic crops</a> have been made to express dsRNA, carefully chosen to silence crucial genes in target pests. These dsRNAs are designed to affect only insects that express specific gene sequences. As a <a href="proof%20of%20principle">proof of principle</a>, in 2009 a study showed RNAs that could kill any one of four fruit fly species while not harming the other three.

In 2012 <a href="Syngenta">Syngenta</a> bought Belgian RNAi firm Devgen for $522 million and <a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a> paid $29.2 million for the exclusive rights to <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> from <a href="Alnylam%20Pharmaceuticals">Alnylam Pharmaceuticals</a>. The <a href="International%20Potato%20Center">International Potato Center</a> in <a href="Lima%2C%20Peru">Lima, Peru</a> is looking for genes to target in the sweet potato weevil, a beetle whose larvae ravage <a href="sweet%20potato">sweet potato</a>es globally. Other researchers are trying to silence genes in ants, caterpillars and pollen beetles. Monsanto will likely be first to market, with a transgenic corn seed that expresses dsRNA based on gene Snf7 from the <a href="western%20corn%20rootworm">western corn rootworm</a>, a <a href="beetle">beetle</a> whose <a href="larvae">larvae</a> annually cause one billion dollars in damage in the United States alone. A 2012 paper showed that silencing Snf7 stunts larval growth, killing them within days. In 2013 the same team showed that the RNA affects very few other species.

Alternatively dsRNA can be supplied without genetic engineering. One approach is to add them to <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' <a href="vascular">vascular</a> system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.

Genome-scale RNAi research relies on <a href="high-throughput%20screening">high-throughput screening</a> (HTS) technology. RNAi HTS technology allows genome-wide loss-of-function screening and is broadly used in the identification of genes associated with specific phenotypes. This technology has been hailed as a potential second genomics wave, following the first genomics wave of <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> <a href="microarray">microarray</a> and <a href="single%20nucleotide%20polymorphism">single nucleotide polymorphism</a> discovery platforms.
One major advantage of genome-scale RNAi screening is its ability to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes. With the ability to generate a large amount of data per experiment, genome-scale RNAi screening has led to an explosion of data generation rates. Exploiting such large data sets is a fundamental challenge, requiring suitable statistics/bioinformatics methods. The basic process of cell-based RNAi screening includes the choice of an RNAi library, robust and stable cell types, transfection with RNAi agents, treatment/incubation, signal detection, analysis and identification of important genes or therapeutical targets.

The process of RNAi was referred to as "co-suppression" and "quelling" when observed prior to the knowledge of an RNA-related mechanism. The discovery of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by <a href="antisense">antisense</a> RNA expressed in <a href="transgenic">transgenic</a> plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant scientists in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter <a href="flower">flower</a> colors in <a href="petunia">petunia</a>s, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding <a href="chalcone%20synthase">chalcone synthase</a>, a key enzyme for flower <a href="pigmentation">pigmentation</a> into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead caused some flowers to have less visible purple pigment, sometimes in variegated patterns, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased or became suppressed in a context-specific manner. This would later be explained as the result of the transgene being inserted adjacent to promoters in the opposite direction in various positions throughout the genomes of some transformants, thus leading to expression of antisense transcripts and gene silencing when these promoters are active. Another early observation of RNAi was came from a study of the <a href="fungus">fungus</a> "<a href="Neurospora%20crassa">Neurospora crassa</a>", although it was not immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called "co-suppression of gene expression", but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.

Not long after, plant <a href="virologist">virologist</a>s working on improving plant resistance to viral diseases observed a similar unexpected phenomenon. While it was known that plants expressing virus-specific proteins showed enhanced tolerance or resistance to viral infection, it was not expected that plants carrying only short, non-coding regions of viral RNA sequences would show similar levels of protection. Researchers believed that viral RNA produced by transgenes could also inhibit viral replication. The reverse experiment, in which short sequences of plant genes were introduced into viruses, showed that the targeted gene was suppressed in an infected plant. This phenomenon was labeled "virus-induced gene silencing" (VIGS), and the set of such phenomena were collectively called "post transcriptional gene silencing."

After these initial observations in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. <a href="Craig%20C.%20Mello">Craig C. Mello</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Fire">Andrew Fire</a>'s 1998 "Nature" paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into "C. elegans". In investigating the regulation of muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor <a href="antisense%20RNA">antisense RNA</a> injections had an effect on protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term "RNAi". This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a>.

Ruth Norman

After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him as their group's leader and primary channeler. She subsequently began publishing accounts of her experiences and <a href="revelation">revelation</a>s. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy to purchase a property to serve as the landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.

Ruth Nields was born in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, Indiana, on August 18, 1900. Three years later, her family moved to <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>, where her father worked as an upholsterer. She and her five siblings were reared there, receiving little education and working from a young age. As a teenager, she labored as a fruit packer and a maid. Most of her income went to her father, whom she later described as abusive.

In 1918, she married a man named Frank R. De Silvas and they had a daughter two years later. The couple divorced in the early 1920s; Frank gained custody of their daughter, although Ruth had access as well. Little is known for certain about Ruth's life from the mid-1920s to the 1940s, but she worked in a variety of jobs. She held positions in several restaurants and also worked as a model, real-estate broker, resort manager, and nanny. In the 1940s, she enrolled at the <a href="Church%20of%20Religious%20Science">Church of Religious Science</a>, where she studied <a href="New%20Thought">New Thought</a> under <a href="Ernest%20Holmes">Ernest Holmes</a>, and was separately introduced to <a href="psychic%20healing">psychic healing</a> in that decade. Over time, she also became interested in <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a>, <a href="Mediumship">channeling</a>, and <a href="past-life%20regression">past-life regression</a>. She married Benjamin Arnold in the 1940s; the marriage lasted until his death in 1951. Two years later, she remarried and settled in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20California">Lancaster, California</a>. Her third husband, George Marian, owned a milk-delivery business which Ruth helped him to manage. In the mid-1950s, she became interested in acting and earned the starring role in a local play.

In 1954, at a <a href="psychic">psychic</a> event in California, Ruth was introduced to <a href="Ernest%20Norman">Ernest Norman</a>, who told her that in a past life she had been the daughter of an Egyptian <a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> and had protected <a href="Moses">Moses</a>. Members of the organization they later established, the <a href="Unarius%20Academy%20of%20Science">Unarius Academy of Science</a>, affirm that Ernest and Ruth married on the day they met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February 14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20Sacramento">California State University, Sacramento</a>, notes in her 2005 study of the group that Ruth was probably still married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956.

Ernest believed he could communicate with both extraterrestrials and historical figures, channeling messages from them. In 1954, seeking to popularize his channeling, Ernest and Ruth formed an organization known as Unarius, operating from their home in California. After their marriage, Ruth served as Ernest's typist, later claiming to have learned the skill while sleeping. She recorded the information he channeled, writing books about psychic healing and trips into the solar system. In the 1950s and 1960s, they attracted several followers, including two students whom they later taught to channel. One early trainee was Charles Spiegel, who later led the group. Many converts had previous involvement with <a href="New%20Age">New Age</a> or <a href="Mysticism">mystic</a> groups, making it easy for the Normans to convert them.

Converts were provided with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a href="Mary%20of%20Bethany">Mary of Bethany</a> among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50 lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an <a href="archangel">archangel</a>. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> and <a href="Lemuria%20%28continent%29">Lemuria</a>. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or <a href="bricolage">bricolage</a> of the surrounding culture.

Ernest and Ruth promoted <a href="Millennialism">millennialist</a> teachings, holding that higher beings were to transform the Earth and bring devotees to a new level of existence; the couple held that this growth would allow people to travel through space. Zeller compares their millennialist doctrines to those of Christian <a href="dispensationalism">dispensationalism</a>, noting their shared utopian views.

Ernest died in 1971; thereafter, Ruth led their organization and served as its primary channeler. Spiegel moved to San Diego to assist her. After Ernest died, Spiegel affirmed Ruth's nascent belief that she was an archangel named Uriel from the "fourth dimension".

In 1972, Ruth Norman began publishing "Tesla Speaks", a series of messages that she said were given to her by the American inventor and engineer <a href="Nikola%20Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> from his dwelling in outer space; she stated that he also relayed messages from scientists <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> and <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> to her. Norman asserted that the <a href="Tesla%20Tower">Tesla Tower</a> held secrets which were to be recovered by Unarius. The American journalist <a href="Alexander%20S.%20Heard">Alexander S. Heard</a> argues that Tesla's rumored interests in <a href="death%20ray">death ray</a>s and <a href="free%20energy%20device">free energy</a> drew the group to him. In 1973, Norman recounted an experience in which she spiritually married the archangel <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Michiel</a> at a lavishly decorated temple on another planet; the event was said to have culminated with her being crowned the Queen of Archangels, Uriel, by the <a href="Raphael%20%28archangel%29">Archangel Raphiel</a>. She and Spiegel envisioned the events of the ceremony over several days, and she published their recollections later that year. Her students subsequently referred to her as Uriel, an acronym of "universal, radiant, infinite, eternal light". She and Spiegel re-enacted the ceremony for her followers, and the group celebrated the anniversary of the event annually. After her spiritual marriage, Norman increased her channeling of historical figures, including <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, Tesla, and <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>.

In a volume published in March 1974, Norman predicted that a spacefleet of an "Intergalactic Confederation" was to land on Earth before December 1974. In November 1974, assisted by some of her students, Norman purchased a property near <a href="Jamul%2C%20California">Jamul, California</a>, to serve as a landing site for extraterrestrials, whom she referred to as the "Space Brothers". At some point in 1974, Norman revised the date at which she expected extraterrestrials to land to September 1975, citing ongoing Confederation efforts to prepare humanity for their landing as the reason for the delay. She predicted that a single flying saucer would bring extraterrestrials to persuade humans of their teachings, after which another 33 vessels would arrive. These beings were to restore the lost teachings of Atlantis to the Earth, and their revelations were to free humanity from crime and disease, ushering in an era of learning. She believed that this information would be imparted by a thousand extraterrestrial scientists, who would also bring advances in technology, among which she specified crystal computers, to Earth. Norman presumed that Confederation leaders were to take her on a world tour after their arrival, and she bought herself a new wardrobe in preparation. In addition, she arranged a large banner to welcome them, made arrangements for buses to the landing site, and informed the "<a href="National%20Enquirer">National Enquirer</a>", an American tabloid, of her expectations. In early September 1975, she gave a farewell message, telling of her future home on a spaceship. On September 22, however, she concluded that a landing would not occur and stated that she was reliving the trauma of a past life—in which she was <a href="Isis">Isis</a>—when she was assassinated shortly before extraterrestrials were to land. She explained that the effects of this trauma had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Norman led the group in classes to teach them how to relive the event that had culminated in Isis' assassination and took them to the expected landing site to stir their memories. They began to hold public meetings again in November. Several students doubted Norman's explanation; some of them left the group.

In 1975, Norman used the proceeds of a home sale to rent a storefront for her group's meetings, which they lavishly decorated. She purported to be the "Spirit of Beauty" and the "Goddess of Love"; in this capacity, she claimed complete knowledge of truth and the ability to heal. After their new headquarters opened, Norman told her students—and the media—that she was an ambassador from the Interplanetary Confederation, and, in February 1975, she opened the Academy of Parapsychology, Healing, and Psychic Science, which soon became known as the Unarius Academy of Science. The group celebrates the anniversary of the union of Earth and the confederation annually around October 12.

Norman pioneered a form of past-life therapy, teaching her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof that the events were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of <a href="San%20Diego%20State%20University">San Diego State University</a> and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies in the way that it wove her followers into the group's narrative.

In March 1976, Norman publicly wagered $4,000 with the British gambling firm <a href="Ladbrokes">Ladbrokes</a> that extraterrestrials would land on Earth within one year, a prediction which attracted media attention. Tumminia states that Norman had "no public distress" over the failure of her prediction. Despite the negative publicity from the prophecy's failure, new members were attracted to the group. After losing the wager, Norman changed the expected landing date to 2001; she taught that the close of the 20th century coincided with the beginning of a new cycle which would bring great benefits to humanity. Representatives of Unarius later stated that the prophecies had been misunderstood and that the Space Brothers had not visited because humanity was not yet ready for them. They have argued that Unarius' teachings must be understood to correctly interpret Norman's statements. Tumminia writes that they used "adaptive storytelling and continuous narrative invention" to explain the failure of the prophecy.

The group enjoyed publicity, and media outlets regularly covered them. Most journalists portrayed Unarius as a curiosity and accentuated its novel aspects. In the area near their headquarters, they were viewed as an unusual group with strict behavioral standards. One local writer published a sensationalist account of the group under the title "The Gods Must Be Crazy". But, after interviewing Norman in 1976, <a href="Brad%20Steiger">Brad Steiger</a>, who has written extensively about the paranormal, gave a positive account of Unarius. Norman disliked academic writings about her organization, seeing them as unfairly negative.

In 1979, Norman claimed to have an unofficial following of more than 100,000. That year, she announced a spiritual promotion: she was no longer an archangel but, with Michiel, a "Lord of the Universe" and a "Prince of the Realm". She renamed Spiegel as "Antares" in 1984, stating that he had overcome the evil of his past incarnations; he subsequently began to channel. As of 1986, the group had about 450 regular students and charged $5 per class. At that time, Norman lived in a house in <a href="La%20Mesa%2C%20California">La Mesa, California</a>, with two of her disciples. In the mid-to-late 1980's, Unarius "mini documentaries" featuring "Uriel" aired as far east as the New York City region, in Westchester County (for one), on public access television.

Assisted by her followers, Norman recorded her teachings in about 80 books. She wrote educational materials designed to empower students by teaching them about subjects such as the "psychology of consciousness" and "self-mastery". Ernest and Ruth Norman's writings are revered as scripture by members of the Unarius Academy. The group developed a set of six core sacred narratives about the past lives of its founders, describing key events on Earth and other planets. These myths featured tales of romance, war, and scientific advances in the <a href="Aries%20%28constellation%29">Aries</a> and <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> constellations and in ancient civilizations on Earth. Kirkpatrick and Tumminia state that the Unarian canon appears to be incoherent to outsiders, but is appreciated as a cohesive body of literature by the group's members.

Norman wore a variety of brightly colored, elaborate costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style gowns and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group.

Followers of Norman held her in high regard: they occasionally fainted when she touched them, and some wept when allowed to meet with her. They painted several portraits of her, one of which they believed had healing powers. According to students, Norman healed them in their dreams and sometimes reported seeing visions of her. Several times, group members chose to forgo cancer treatment, trusting in Norman to heal them. Tumminia says that Norman was a clear example of the German sociologist <a href="Max%20Weber">Max Weber</a>'s concept of <a href="charismatic%20authority">charismatic authority</a>. Norman sometimes had disagreements with students and excommunicated two senior assistants who questioned her, although she welcomed one back a few years later. If healing was unsuccessfully sought, the failure to receive it was sometimes attributed to disloyalty to leadership. Criticism of Norman was not tolerated by the group; Tumminia describes Norman's leadership style as "benign authoritarian".

In 1988, Norman broke a hip and her health began to decline. Although she had promised to live until 2001, her deteriorating condition made her followers suspect she would die before then, causing them some distress and denial. In an attempt to help her recover, students used past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events in which they had rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making a quicker than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted to a hospital in December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated that the Space Brothers had given her permission to die before their expected arrival in 2001.

Before her death, Norman met with each of her followers; she died on July 12, 1993, and was cremated. In her will, she promised to return to Earth, accompanied by the Space Brothers, in eight years. Students, some of whom were surprised and confused by her death, were instructed by leaders not to grieve because she was in a celestial state. Some of them privately mourned, and a few left the group. Items of Norman's were distributed to students, some of whom wore them at later events.

After Norman's death, Antares took over as leader and channeled messages from her. Others later began channeling her, and recordings of her messages were replayed. Antares died in 1999, and a board of directors assumed leadership of the organization and channeled. In the 2000s, Unarius' leaders emphasized individual transformation, focusing on a gradual spiritual change in humanity.

Images of Norman have been used to attract attention by some outside of the Unarius Academy of Science. In 1996, an <a href="MTV">MTV</a> executive viewed a picture of Norman and decided to use her image in an advertising campaign for the <a href="MTV%20Music%20Video%20Awards">MTV Music Video Awards</a>. The network contacted the Unarius Academy of Science and received permission to use a look-alike in their promotions. In 2000, Norman was featured on the cover of "", a book about personalities with fringe beliefs.

After Norman's death, public opinion of her organization was strongly influenced by the 1997 mass suicide of <a href="Heaven%27s%20Gate%20%28group%29">Heaven's Gate</a>, a <a href="UFO%20religion">UFO religion</a> whose members occupied a house within of the Unarius Academy of Science. In the suicides' aftermath, some reporters and members of the <a href="anti-cult%20movement">anti-cult movement</a> described Unarius as a similar group. Tumminia disagreed with this portrayal, casting Unarius' practices as no more dangerous than those of widely accepted religions.

Jane Joseph

Jane Marian Joseph (31 May 1894 – 9 March 1929) was an English composer, arranger and music teacher. She was a pupil and later associate of the composer <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>, and was instrumental in the organisation and management of various of the music festivals which Holst sponsored. Many of her works were composed for performance at these festivals and similar occasions. Her early death at age 35, which prevented the full realisation of her talents, was considered by her contemporaries as a considerable loss to English music.

Holst first observed Joseph's potential when he was teaching her composition at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Girls%27%20School">St Paul's Girls' School</a>. She began to act as his <a href="amanuensis">amanuensis</a> in 1914, when he was composing "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>", her special responsibility being the preparation of the score for the "Neptune" movement. She continued to assist Holst with transcriptions, arrangements and translations, and was his librettist for the choral ballet "The Golden Goose".

During her short professional life she became an active member of the <a href="Society%20of%20Women%20Musicians">Society of Women Musicians</a>, was the prime mover behind the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and helped to found the Kensington Choral Society. She also taught music at a girls' school, where Holst's daughter <a href="Imogen%20Holst">Imogen</a> was one of her pupils, and became a leading figure in the musical life of <a href="Morley%20College">Morley College</a>. Two memorial prizes and scholarships were endowed in her name.

Most of Joseph's compositions were never published and are now considered lost. Of her published works, two early short orchestral pieces, "Morris Dance" and "Bergamask" won considerable critical praise, although neither became part of the general orchestral repertory. Two choral works, "A Festival Venite" and "A Hymn for Whitsuntide" were admired during her lifetime, but never commercially recorded. Since her death, her work has seldom been performed, but occasionally been broadcast. Her carol "A Little Childe There is Ibore" was thought by Holst to be among the best of its kind.

Jane Joseph was born on 31 May 1894 at 23 Clanricarde Gardens, in the <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a> district of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Kensington">Borough of Kensington</a>, London, to a prosperous Jewish family. Her father, George Solomon Joseph (1844–1917), a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a> in his family's firm, had married Henrietta, née Franklin (1861–1938) in 1880. Jane was their fourth child; the youngest of her three brothers was seven years older than her. George Joseph had a deep interest in music, which he passed on to his children; two sons, Frank (1881–1944) and Edwin (1887–1975), became competent string players, while Jane learned piano (she took her first examination at the age of seven) and later, double-bass. In time, Frank's musical children, with Jane and friends, formed the basis of a "Josephs orchestra" that performed concerts at Frank's home for many years.

In 1909 Joseph won a scholarship to <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Girls%27%20School">St Paul's Girls' School</a> (SPGS) in <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>. The school had opened in 1904, as an offshoot of the long-established <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20School%2C%20London">St Paul's School</a> for boys. Its high mistress, Frances Ralph Gray, was a formidable figure with traditional views about female education, who nevertheless provided a lively and varied learning environment in which Joseph excelled. Apart from her academic successes, Joseph played double-bass in the school orchestra, gave an acclaimed piano performance of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>'s <a href="D%20minor">D minor</a> keyboard concerto, began to compose, and won a prize for <a href="sight-reading">sight-reading</a>. While at the school she composed "The Carrion Crow", a song setting which, in 1914, became her first published work. Outside music she supported the school's Literary Society, where she presented papers on <a href="Charlotte%20Bront%C3%AB">Charlotte Brontë</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>. She also won Honours in the examinations of the <a href="Royal%20Drawing%20Society">Royal Drawing Society</a>.

Among the music teachers at SPGS, most significantly in terms of her musical development, Joseph encountered the emergent composer <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>, then little known, who taught her composition. After leaving the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> in 1898 Holst had earned his living as an organist, and as a trombonist in various orchestras, while awaiting critical recognition as a composer. In 1903 he gave up his orchestral appointments to concentrate on composing, but found that he needed a regular income. He became a music teacher, initially at the <a href="James%20Allen%27s%20Girls%27%20School">James Allen's Girls' School</a> in <a href="Dulwich">Dulwich</a>; in 1905 he was recommended to Frances Gray by Adine O'Neill, a former pupil of <a href="Clara%20Schumann">Clara Schumann</a>, who taught piano at SPGS. He was first appointed on a part-time basis to teach singing, and later extended his activities to cover the school's wider music curriculum including conducting and composition. According to the composer Alan Gibbs, Joseph quickly came under Holst's spell, and adopted his principles as her own. Holst later described her as the best girl pupil he ever had: "From the first she showed an individual attitude of mind and an eagerness to absorb all that was beautiful".

In the autumn of 1913, at the age of 19, Joseph began studying <a href="Classics">Classics</a> at <a href="Girton%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Girton College, Cambridge</a>. At that time, under Cambridge University regulations that were not fully repealed until 1948, women were ineligible to receive degrees, although they could sit the degree examinations, in Joseph's case the <a href="Classical%20Tripos">Classical Tripos</a>. She soon found much in the university's life to divert her from her regular studies: debating, drama and, above all, music. In her first term she became a double-bass player in the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Musical%20Society">Cambridge University Musical Society</a> orchestra, under its conductor <a href="Cyril%20Rootham">Cyril Rootham</a>. She also sang <a href="alto">alto</a> in the society's choir, and may have participated in a performance of <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>'s "<a href="La%20damnation%20de%20Faust">La damnation de Faust</a>" that was praised in the "Cambridge Review" of 17 June 1914. During vacations she continued her composition studies under Holst; in 1916 her "Wassail Song", a companion piece to "The Carrion Crow", was published. At Girton she wrote incidental music for a performance of <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>'s verse play "<a href="The%20Countess%20Cathleen">The Countess Cathleen</a>", in which she acted the part of the First Dragon.

From 1915 Joseph's association with Holst became closer. Overextended by his teaching duties and other commitments, Holst required assistance in the task of organising his music for publication and performance, and used a group of young women volunteers—his "scribes"—to make fair copies of his scores, write out instrumental or vocal parts, or prepare piano arrangements. In 1915 the composer was working on his largest and best-known work, the orchestral suite "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>", and invited Joseph, in her vacations, to join his scribes. Among these were Vally Lasker, a piano teacher from SPGS, and Nora Day, who had been a pupil with Joseph at the school and since 1913 had been teaching there. Joseph's main assignment for "The Planets" was to copy the "Neptune" movement, of which almost the entire original manuscript is written in her hand. For the rest of her career she remained one of Holst's most regular <a href="amanuenses">amanuenses</a>, and he came to rely on her more than on any other. Her commitments to musical activities at Girton, combined with her work for Holst, had an adverse effect on her formal studies. In the 1916 Classical Tripos examinations she was awarded only a Class III pass, a disappointing result duly noted in her parting testimonial from the college.

When Joseph left Girton, the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> was at a critical state; the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> had begun on 1 July 1916. Joseph wanted to assist the war effort, and after considering work on the land or in a munitions factory, took up part-time welfare work in <a href="Islington">Islington</a>. In the autumn of 1916 she began teaching at <a href="Caterham%20School">Eothen</a>, a small private school for girls in <a href="Caterham">Caterham</a>, founded and run by the Misses Catharine and Winifred Pye. In 1917 Holst's ten-year-old daughter <a href="Imogen%20Holst">Imogen</a> started at the school; soon, under Joseph's guidance the young pupil was composing her own music. Joseph extended her own musical activities by joining the orchestra at <a href="Morley%20College">Morley College</a>, where Holst was the director of music and where her brother Edwin had played the cello before the war. At first she played the double-bass, but later took <a href="French%20horn">French horn</a> lessons, possibly from <a href="Adolf%20Borsdorf">Adolph Borsdorf</a>; later still, at very short notice, she taught herself the <a href="timpani">timpani</a> part for a summer concert. By 1918 she was a member of the Morley committee that on 9 March organised and produced an opera burlesque, "English Opera as She is Wrote", in which English, Italian, German, French and Russian opera styles were parodied in successive scenes. The performance was a great success and was repeated at several venues. It may have inspired Holst to use parody in his own opera, "<a href="The%20Perfect%20Fool">The Perfect Fool</a>", which he began composing in 1918. In her spare time Joseph founded and ran a choir for Kensington <a href="Nanny">nannies</a>, which took part in local singing contests as the "Linden Singers".

Joseph increased her teaching commitments by often deputising for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS. She also continued in her role of the composer's amanuensis, and was invited to attend the private premiere of "The Planets", on 29 September 1918 at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>, where <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a> conducted the Queen's Hall orchestra. She later wrote: "From the moment of Mars ... to the last sound of Neptune, it was a big thing that will last all our lives, I think". She was able to draw on her classical education at Girton when she helped to translate the <a href="Apocryphal%20gospels">apocryphal</a> work "<a href="Acts%20of%20John">The Acts of John</a>" from the original Greek, to provide the text for Holst's "Hymn of Jesus" (1917); for the same work she prepared a vocal score and an arrangement for piano, strings and organ. She and Holst combined to produce a women's voices version (two sopranos and an alto) of <a href="William%20Byrd">William Byrd</a>'s "Mass for Three Voices", and Joseph worked alone to produce an orchestral accompaniment for <a href="Samuel%20Wesley">Samuel Wesley</a>'s "Sing Aloud with Gladness". This latter work was prepared for the 1917 <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> musical festival, one of an annual series of such festivals that Holst masterminded, first at his home town of <a href="Thaxted">Thaxted</a>, in later years at assorted venues including <a href="Dulwich">Dulwich</a>, <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a> and <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. Joseph became a key figure in these festivals, as organiser, performer and composer. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her compositions were performed: "Hymn" for female voices (now lost), and an orchestral piece, "Barbara Noel's Morris", which Joseph wrote to mark her friendship with the daughter of <a href="Conrad%20Noel">Conrad Noel</a>, Thaxted's vicar.

The years 1917 and 1918 also brought personal sadness. On 22 October 1917 Joseph's father died from a heart attack. On 27 May the following year, just after the Whitsun festival, her brother William was killed in action on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">western front</a>; in September, Edwin was severely wounded in the final Allied offensive of the war. In his monograph on Joseph's life and music, the composer Alan Gibbs writes that "there is no hint in Jane's letters of the effect these events had on her". Gibbs quotes <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a>, who wrote of those times: "... if we wept—as weep we did—we wept in secret".

In 1919, seeking to consolidate her musical career, Joseph joined the <a href="Society%20of%20Women%20Musicians">Society of Women Musicians</a> (SWM), founded in 1911 by the violinist and musicologist <a href="Marion%20Scott%20%28musicologist%29">Marion Scott</a> and others to promote the interests of women in music. Scott was known to Joseph, having been <a href="Concertmaster">leader</a> of the Morley orchestra. Joseph became a member of the SWM's Composers' Sectional Committee, and occasionally gave lectures to the society on subjects such as "The Necessity of Practical Experience for Composers", and "The Composer as Pupil". In the summer of 1919 she took conducting lessons from <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a>, whom she described as "the most chinless man I have ever met". The purpose of the lessons was to enable her to conduct her orchestral work "Bergamask", which was performed at the <a href="London%20Coliseum">Coliseum Theatre</a> under a scheme devised by <a href="Sir%20Oswald%20Stoll">Sir Oswald Stoll</a> to showcase new British music. In that same summer she met <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, a close friend of Holst. She played him some of her music, probably a piano reduction of "Bergamask", and described him as "a very appreciative critic".

Towards the end of 1918 Holst had asked Joseph to provide a libretto for his opera "The Perfect Fool", feeling that she might possess the required light touch that he thought his own writing lacked. It is not clear whether she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music "The Sneezing Charm"; the ballet, entitled "A Magic Hour", was performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her "Mirage" cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of <a href="Walter%20de%20la%20Mare">Walter de la Mare</a> poems in December.

At Eothen, Joseph continued to supervise Imogen Holst's musical education, aspects of which had earlier been causing Holst some concern. In a letter to his wife dated February 1919, written when he was serving as <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> musical organiser for British troops stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean, Holst reported that "I've had a very kind and wise letter from Jane about Imogen". Whatever issues had troubled Holst were resolved satisfactorily, and Joseph became Imogen's theory teacher: "Theory with Jane is "ripping"", the young pupil enthused. In the summer term of 1920, with help from Joseph, Imogen devised and composed a "Dance of Nymphs and Shepherds" which was performed at the school on 9 July. At the beginning of 1921 Imogen started at SPGS; before becoming a boarder at Bute House (one of the school's residences for pupils), she stayed in the Joseph family home.

The Whitsun festivals, suspended during Holst's absence, resumed at Dulwich in 1920. Joseph's part in this event is unrecorded, but she made a major contribution to the following year's festivities, which began beside the Thames at <a href="Isleworth">Isleworth</a> and concluded on Whit Monday at SPGS in the gardens of Bute House. For the Monday's celebrations Joseph devised a presentation of <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>'s <a href="semi-opera">semi-opera</a> from 1690, "<a href="Dioclesian">Dioclesian</a>". Writing of the occasion after Joseph's death, Holst recalled that she had woven Purcell's music and <a href="Thomas%20Betterton">Thomas Betterton</a>'s text, both long neglected, "into a delightful out-door pageant founded on a fairy story, complete with lost princess, dragon and princely hero". Not satisfied with planning every aspect of the outdoor performance, Joseph prepared an indoors version of the entertainment, should the weather require this. The production was a great success, and was repeated that summer in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a> and, in October 1921, at the <a href="The%20Old%20Vic">Old Vic</a> theatre. Throughout this considerable organisational task, Holst wrote, "Jane gave the minimum of worry to each person concerned by giving herself the maximum of hard work and forethought".

In November 1921 Joseph organised the Morley forces to perform a large-scale pageant, celebrating the bicentenary of the church of <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>. The text was by <a href="Laurence%20Housman">Laurence Housman</a> and the music, directed by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory. In the following year Joseph's increasing recognition as a composer was confirmed when her "Seven Two-Part Songs" were performed at a SWM concert that included works by <a href="Ethel%20Smyth">Ethel Smyth</a> and other women composers. Two of Joseph's works, "A Hymn for Whitsuntide" and "A Festival Venite" were introduced during the 1922 Whitsun festival at All Saints' church, <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath</a>, with Holst conducting. After the "Venite" premiere Joseph wrote appreciatively to Holst: "Do you suppose for one moment that any other conductor takes trouble like that? If you do, you are quite wrong". The "Venite" was performed on 13 June 1923 at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>, by the Philharmonic Choir under <a href="Charles%20Kennedy%20Scott">Charles Kennedy Scott</a>; the "<a href="The%20Spectator">Spectator</a>"s critic thought it a "very notable addition to modern British music". Amidst her compositional and other activities, Joseph found time, in 1922, to organise the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and to orchestrate many of the competition songs. In due course this festival became an important annual event in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators. On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams's 50th birthday, Joseph organised a choir which gave an early-morning surprise performance in the composer's garden of a song she had written to mark the occasion.

As early as 1919, Joseph had written to her brother Edwin expressing concern about Holst's health. When following a physical breakdown in 1923 Holst gave up his duties at Morley College, Joseph wrote him a supportive letter congratulating him on his decision which would enable him to concentrate on composition. The following years were particularly fruitful for Holst, and Joseph assisted in many of the works he produced in the 1924–28 period. She helped him prepare the score for his "Choral Symphony", for which assistance he presented her with his original draft sketches, as a gesture of gratitude. Together with Lasker and Day she worked to prepare vocal and full scores for the opera "<a href="At%20the%20Boar%27s%20Head">At the Boar's Head</a>", and attended the rehearsals in March 1925. After the opera's premiere on 3 April she wrote to Holst with mildly critical comments on some of the singers, though with praise for the conductor, the young <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a>. When Holst composed a short choral piece to celebrate the 21st birthday of the Oriana Madrigal Society, Joseph provided words which humorously reflected the conductor Kennedy Scott's working methods; the work was greatly appreciated by the choir. In that same year, 1925, she helped to found the Kensington Choral Society. By this time the Joseph home in Kensington, where Jane lived for her whole life, was becoming a recognised musical gathering-place; a visitor recalled meeting Vaughan Williams, Boult, and the harpist <a href="Sidonie%20Goossens">Sidonie Goossens</a> there, among others.

In 1926 Joseph provided Holst with the libretto for his choral ballet "The Golden Goose", based on a story by the <a href="Brothers%20Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a>, and arranged its first performance at the 1926 Whitsun festival, held at the James Allen school. Joseph also assisted Holst and the librettist <a href="Steuart%20Wilson">Steuart Wilson</a> in the production of a second choral ballet, "The Morning of the Year"—the first work commissioned by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s newly formed music department—which was performed at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in March 1927. The Morley College Annual Report of 1927 recorded the formation of a folk dance club, and noted Joseph's "skilful direction" of the group. Her increasing interest in dance led her, that year, to join the English Folk Dance Society and the Kensington Dance Club.

The main feature of the 1928 Whitsun festival, held at <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, was a religious drama, "The Coming of Christ", commissioned by <a href="George%20Bell%20%28bishop%29">George Bell</a>, then <a href="Dean%20of%20Canterbury">Dean of Canterbury</a>, and written by <a href="John%20Masefield">John Masefield</a>. Holst provided the incidental music. In a photograph described by Gibbs, taken of the festival's organisers and performers, Joseph is sitting between Holst and Mrs Bell, "taller than either, an efficient-looking lady in her early thirties, clearly of some importance to the festival". This was Joseph's last Whitsun. Towards the end of the year her health began to fail; there is a mention in Holst's diary for 29 November 1928, "Jane's concert 8.15", but no indication is given of whether she was a performer. In February 1929 she paid off the final amount owing to the piano manufacturer <a href="C.%20Bechstein%20Pianofortefabrik">C. Bechstein</a>, for Morley's new piano for which she had been fundraising since 1926. On 9 March 1929 Joseph died at home, in Kensington, of kidney failure. After a private funeral she was buried in <a href="Willesden%20Jewish%20Cemetery">Willesden Jewish Cemetery</a>.

Holst was in Venice when the news of Joseph's death reached him; although Imogen records that he received it stoically, he was privately devastated. Joseph had, wrote Imogen, "come nearest to his ideal of clear thinking and clear feeling". In his own tribute, Holst drew attention to Joseph's "infinite capacity for taking pains which amounts to genius". No Whitsun festival was held in 1929, but in early July, at an open-air production of Holst's "The Golden Goose" at <a href="Warwick%20Castle">Warwick Castle</a>, a special performance of his "St Paul's Suite" was played in Joseph's memory. On 5 December 1929, at a competitive music festival, Vaughan Williams conducted the choir in Joseph's "Hymn for Whitsuntide" while the audience stood in tribute. The same hymn was played at the first resumed Whitsun festival, at <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a> in May 1930. In July 1931 Holst included her music in a concert that he conducted at <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a>, alongside works by <a href="William%20Byrd">William Byrd</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Weelkes">Thomas Weelkes</a> and Vaughan Williams. Over the course of the next few years Joseph's works were played at concerts and events organised by Morley College, the SWM, SPGS and the English Folk Dance Society. At Eothen a "Jane Joseph Memorial Prize" was established, and music scholarships were endowed in her name at Eothen and SPGS.

A friend who expressed personal sadness on hearing of Joseph's death revealed another aspect of her character: "England won't be the same without Jane. She was terribly difficult to get to know at all, and awfully lonely, I thought, in spite of all her friends—don't you think so?—but I can't imagine Music without her".

Much of Joseph's music was written for performances at modest-scale events by amateur performers. As such it was never published, and over the years many works have been lost. The published works and the few others that survive, Gibbs believes, place Joseph in the category of "progressive" English composers. Although her first few compositions were mainly songs, she demonstrated early abilities as an orchestral composer. Gibbs finds in her two short pieces, "Morris Dance" (1917) (originally "Barbara Noel's Morris") and "Bergamask" (1919), three and five minutes respectively, a "fine feeling for orchestral sound". The "Morris Dance" has added sparkle from a <a href="glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a>, while "Bergamask" has a festive Italianate feel. The music writer Philip Scowcroft praises Joseph's confident handling of the sizeable orchestral forces required for the "Morris Dance", while the composer <a href="Havergal%20Brian">Havergal Brian</a>, Holst's contemporary, found "Bergamask" "exhilarating" and "full of promise". Gibbs suggests that these two works presage Holst's late choral ballets, and comments: "That these carefree pieces did not find a permanent place in the repertory is unfortunate".

In Joseph's "Mirage" song cycle of 1921 (five songs with string quartet accompaniment), a Holstian influence is evident alongside her own distinctive compositional voice. Gibbs highlights the first in the cycle, "Song", which initially echoes "To Varuna" from Holst's "Rig Veda" hymns, but evolves into "a different creation, distinguished by its own uncluttered quartet writing in which the viola has a special part to play". The final song, "Echo", has as much in common with <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> as with Holst. Joseph's "Festival Venite" from 1922 is an example of her use of the <a href="Dorian%20mode%23Modern%20Dorian%20mode">Modern Dorian mode</a> (an ascending scale from D to the next D on the white piano keys), which became a feature of some of her later works. Scowcroft and Gibbs both point to Tudor influences in the "Venite" in which also, says Gibbs, "the congenial influence of Vaughan Williams in melody and harmony is felt". The orchestral score for this work lost, but an organ accompaniment has been devised. Joseph's unaccompanied choral "Hymn for Whitsuntide" also uses the Dorian Mode in what Holst described as a "flawless little motet"; this was first work of Joseph's to be broadcast, in 1968. A "Short String Quartet" in A minor was performed by the Winifred Smith Quartet in December 1922 and was accepted for publication by J.B. Cramer and Co. However, it was not published, and subsequently disappeared.

Joseph's carol "A Little Childe There is Ibore", is a setting of a 15th-century poem for three female voices and piano or strings. Holst considered this "the best of Jane's many carols, and perhaps the hardest to perform well." Written in alternate bars of five and seven beats, it was praised by Brian for its originality. It was eventually broadcast by the BBC on 21 December 1995. Brian was also an admirer of Joseph's many instructional piano pieces: "pleasingly simple and unaffected". These were published between 1920 and 1925; Gibbs writes that these pieces "focus on technical aspects in tuneful and often modal contexts", with occasional excursions into other forms such as <a href="chaconne">chaconne</a> and <a href="Rondo%23Rondo%20form">rondo</a>.

1955 MacArthur Airport United Airlines crash

On April 4, 1955, a <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> <a href="Douglas%20DC-6">Douglas DC-6</a> named "Mainliner Idaho" crashed shortly after taking off from <a href="Long%20Island%20MacArthur%20Airport">Long Island MacArthur Airport</a>, in <a href="Ronkonkoma%2C%20New%20York">Ronkonkoma</a>, <a href="Islip%2C%20New%20York">Islip, New York</a>, United States.

The flight was operated for the purpose of maintaining the currency of the <a href="instrument%20rating">instrument rating</a> of two of the airline's pilots. Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through , the plane began banking to the right. It continued to roll through 90 degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground. All three members of the flight crew were killed upon impact.

A subsequent investigation found a simulated <a href="engine%20failure">engine failure</a> procedure was being conducted, which involved a member of the crew pulling back the <a href="throttle">throttle</a> lever for <a href="Aircraft%20engine%20position%20number">engine No.</a> 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to <a href="controllable-pitch%20propeller">reverse</a>—a feature designed to <a href="thrust%20reversal">slow the aircraft</a> upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The <a href="Civil%20Aeronautics%20Board">Civil Aeronautics Board</a> (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.

In the aftermath of the accident, the <a href="Civil%20Aeronautics%20Administration%20%28United%20States%29">Civil Aeronautics Administration</a> (CAA) issued an <a href="Airworthiness%20Directive">Airworthiness Directive</a> ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the propeller blades. United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed.

On April 4, 1955, a United Airlines check captain, Stanley C. Hoyt, age 45, was carrying out <a href="instrument%20rating">instrument rating</a> checks on two of the airline's pilots. Hoyt had been employed by United Airlines since 1937, and had 9,763 flying hours experience, 549 of which were in a DC-6. He was training the two pilots, Henry M. Dozier, age 40, and Vernis H. Webb, age 35, so they would be able to retain an instrument rating qualification, allowing them to fly under <a href="instrument%20flight%20rules">instrument flight rules</a>. The aircraft was a <a href="Douglas%20DC-6">Douglas DC-6</a>, <a href="aircraft%20registration">registration</a> N37512, <a href="serial%20number">serial number</a> 43001. The airframe had flown 22,068 flying hours, and had undergone an inspection 105 hours before the accident. The aircraft was powered by four <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20R2800-CB16">Pratt & Whitney R2800-CB16</a> engines, fitted with <a href="Hamilton%20Standard">Hamilton Standard</a> 43E60-317 propellers.

The weather on the day of the accident was clear, although there was a strong wind of about hitting the airfield from the southwest, with occasional gusts of wind as fast as . The aircraft made several circuits, taking off and landing again, before eyewitnesses observed the aircraft standing at the end of the <a href="runway">runway</a> and then taking off at about 15:50 <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a>. The takeoff weight was around , far below the aircraft's maximum permissible weight and the <a href="Center%20of%20gravity%20of%20an%20aircraft">center of gravity</a> was within the prescribed limits for the model of aircraft.

Between and down the runway, the aircraft reached <a href="V%20speeds">take-off speed</a>, lifted off the ground, and began climbing normally as the crew retracted the <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a>. Upon climbing through , the aircraft began <a href="Banked%20turn">banking</a> to the right. The climbing bank continued to increase at a rate which alarmed witnesses, and soon after the aircraft rolled through 90<a href="Degree%20%28angle%29">°</a> (at which point the wings were vertical to the ground). At a height of around , with all four engines producing take-off <a href="thrust">thrust</a>, the nose began to fall. Moments later the right wing and nose impacted the ground, causing the fuselage to cartwheel over, before the aircraft came to rest, with the correct side up. It was immediately engulfed in flames. All three members of the flight crew were instantly killed. Although <a href="emergency%20services">emergency services</a> at Long Island MacArthur promptly responded to the crash, the aircraft was destroyed by the post-crash fire.

The <a href="Civil%20Aeronautics%20Board">Civil Aeronautics Board</a> (CAB), charged with investigating the accident, examined the wreckage at Long Island MacArthur Airport. Reports from witnesses of the crash indicated the aircraft appeared to have made a normal takeoff and began climbing normally. But, moments later it began banking sharply to the right. Investigators examined the four charred engines and concluded all were producing power at the point of impact. They could not conclusively determine the amount of power being produced, but stated there was no evidence found in the wreckage that suggested the engines might have suffered an operational failure.

They were also able to determine all of the <a href="flight%20control%20surfaces">flight control surfaces</a>, including the <a href="elevator%20%28aeronautics%29">elevators</a>, <a href="aileron">aileron</a>s and <a href="rudder">rudder</a>, were functioning properly at the point of the crash, and there were no faults in the <a href="Aircraft%20flight%20control%20system">flight control system</a>. The <a href="flap%20%28aeronautics%29">flaps</a> were extended to between 15° and 20°, the standard setting for take-off. The propeller blades of No. 4 engine— on the far right side of the aircraft—were reversed—minus 8°, while the blades of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines were at 34° positive <a href="Blade%20pitch">pitch</a> (also standard for take-off).

The propellers of a DC-6 are designed to provide <a href="Thrust%20reversal">reverse thrust</a> after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to <a href="controllable-pitch%20propeller">rotate the blades</a> to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a <a href="go-around">go-around</a>, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.

The <a href="Douglas%20Aircraft%20Company">Douglas Aircraft Company</a> designed a system that would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closed—meaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on "Mainliner Idaho".

The CAB carried out flight tests using a DC-6. They found that if the propellers were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again in the air to produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.

If full left <a href="aileron">aileron</a> was applied, the aircraft could be recovered for a short period of time, but a violent turn to the right would continue, and the competing forces would cause the aircraft to <a href="stall%20%28flight%29">stall</a>, and violently roll and pitch down. Flight tests, investigators said, accurately reproduced what happened to "Mainliner Idaho" during the accident sequence. The tests performed by United and by the investigators showed that if, after the aircraft became airborne, full power was applied to an engine whose propellers were reversed, the propellers would produce not positive thrust, but increased reverse thrust. One aviation author wrote of the crash,

While the wreckage was being examined, investigators found that all four engines were producing thrust at the time of impact. There were only two ways that the propeller could be reversed during the take-off sequence. Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since, after detailed examination of the engine hub, there was no evidence found of this happening. Therefore, it was concluded that the only way the propeller could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action. Although there was no formal evidence that a simulated <a href="engine%20failure">engine failure</a> was being performed, statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case. United Airlines procedure calls for No. 4 engine to be shut down in a simulated engine failure—the same engine which was found at the crash site with its propellers reversed.
The investigation concluded the accident sequence began when the check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past the idle position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, it would have been a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanisms—and increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.

The final accident report concluded there wasn't sufficient time for the crew to react, since the dive began suddenly while the plane was so close to the ground. "Control will be lost so quickly that there is little, if anything, that the pilot can do if it occurs at low altitude," the report stated. "He must recognize what is occurring, analyze it, and take action to unreverse in a very limited amount of time. It is doubtful that unreversing could have been accomplished in this instance before control was lost."

On October 4, 1955, the CAB released the final accident report, which concluded the reversal of the propellers and subsequent increase in power of the No. 4 engine had caused the accident.

Following the accident, the <a href="Civil%20Aeronautics%20Administration%20%28United%20States%29">Civil Aeronautics Administration</a> (CAA) issued an <a href="Airworthiness%20Directive">Airworthiness Directive</a> ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a sequence gate latch, known as a Martin bar. The device is a metal bar which a crew would manually swing in front of the thrust levers over the idle line, physically preventing the thrust levers from being retarded into the reverse position. According to the CAB report, a United Airlines engineer told investigators the Martin bar should make propeller reversal "a more reliable and safer device [than the system fitted to "Mainliner Idaho"] ... with its numerous switches, relays, and automatic operation."

United Airlines issued a statement saying it had begun installing the device on its fleet of DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft one week before the accident, having used it successfully in service on their fleet of <a href="Douglas%20DC-7">Douglas DC-7</a> aircraft. A Martin bar had not yet been fitted on "Mainliner Idaho". United Airlines also said a program had begun to install reverse thrust indicator lights on all their DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft. The signals, fitted in the cockpit of the aircraft, would have warned the flight crew that the thrust lever had been pulled back too far, and the propellers had been reversed.

Since the crash, there have been several <a href="Thrust%20reversal%23Thrust%20reversal-related%20accidents">other accidents</a> involving reverse thrust. A <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a> operating <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%20859">United Airlines Flight 859</a> crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the landing roll. The left engines remained in forward thrust, while the right engines went into reverse, causing the aircraft to veer rapidly to the right and collide with airport construction vehicles, killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground.
<a href="Japan%20Airlines%20Flight%20350">Japan Airlines Flight 350</a>, a DC-8, crashed in 1982 short of the runway in Tokyo, after the mentally ill captain attempted suicide during the final approach phase of the flight, by putting the inboard engines into reverse thrust. Of the 174 people aboard, 24 died.
In 1991, <a href="Lauda%20Air%20Flight%20004">Lauda Air Flight 004</a>, operated by a <a href="Boeing%20767">Boeing 767</a>, crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed in-flight for reasons that could not be determined. The <a href="TAM%20Transportes%20A%C3%A9reos%20Regionais%20Flight%20402">crash</a> of a <a href="TAM%20Airlines">TAM Airlines</a> <a href="Fokker%20100">Fokker 100</a> in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled to the right and crashed in a populated area of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, Brazil.

Sesame Street research

In 1969, the children's television show "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>" premiered on the <a href="National%20Educational%20Television">National Educational Television</a> network (later succeeded by <a href="PBS">PBS</a>) in the United States. Unlike earlier children's programming, the show's producers used research and over 1,000 studies and experiments to create the show and test its impact on its young viewers' learning. By the end of the program's first season, the organization founded to oversee "Sesame Street" production, <a href="Sesame%20Workshop">Children's Television Workshop</a> (CTW), had developed what came to be called "the CTW model": a system of planning, production, and evaluation that combined the expertise of researchers and early childhood educators with that of the program's writers, producers, and directors.

CTW conducted research in two ways: in-house <a href="Formative%20assessment">formative research</a> that informed and improved production, and independent <a href="Summative%20assessment">summative evaluations</a> conducted by the <a href="Educational%20Testing%20Service">Educational Testing Service</a> (ETS) during the show's first two seasons to measure the program's educational effectiveness. CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers' attention to the program. Based on these findings, the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly. The formative research on "Sesame Street" was the first time children's television viewing was studied scientifically.

Summative research conducted over the years, including two landmark evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that viewing the program had positive effects on young viewers' learning, school readiness, and social skills. Subsequent studies have replicated these findings, such as the effect of the show in countries outside of the US, several <a href="longitudinal%20studies">longitudinal studies</a>, the effects of war and natural disasters on young children, and studies about how the show affected viewers' cognition. As CTW researcher <a href="Gerald%20S.%20Lesser">Gerald S. Lesser</a> stated in 1974, early tests conducted on the show (both formative and summative) "suggested that "Sesame Street" was making strides towards teaching what it had set out to teach".

According to author Louise A. Gikow, Sesame Street's use of research to create individual episodes and to test its effect on its young viewers set it apart from other children's programming. Co-creator <a href="Joan%20Ganz%20Cooney">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> called the idea of combining research with television production "positively heretical" because it had never been done before. Before "Sesame Street", most children's television shows were locally produced, with hosts who, according to researchers <a href="Edward%20L.%20Palmer">Edward L. Palmer</a> and <a href="Shalom%20M.%20Fisch">Shalom M. Fisch</a>, "represented the scope and vision of a single individual" and were often condescending to their audience. Scriptwriters of these shows had no training in education or child development.

The <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation">Carnegie Corporation</a>, one of "Sesame Street's" first financial backers, hired Cooney, a producer of <a href="educational%20television">educational</a> talk shows and documentaries with little experience in education, during the summer of 1967 to visit experts in <a href="child%20development">childhood development</a>, education, and media across the US and Canada. She researched their ideas about the viewing habits of young children, and wrote a report on her findings entitled "Television for Preschool Education", which described out how television could be used as an aid in the education of preschoolers, especially those living in inner cities. Cooney's study became the basis for "Sesame Street"; full funding was procured for its development and production and the creation of the <a href="Children%27s%20Television%20Workshop">Children's Television Workshop</a> (CTW), the organization responsible for producing the new show. According to Gikow, the show's financial backers, which consisted of the US federal government, the <a href="Corporation%20for%20Public%20Broadcasting">Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a> and the <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation</a>, insisted on "testing at critical stages to evaluate its ultimate success".

During the summer of 1968, <a href="Gerald%20S.%20Lesser">Gerald S. Lesser</a>, CTW's first advisory-board chairman, conducted five three-day <a href="curriculum">curriculum</a>-planning seminars in Boston and New York City to select a curriculum for the new program. Seminar participants were television producers and child development experts. It was the first time a children's television show used a curriculum, which Palmer, who was responsible for conducting the show's <a href="Formative%20assessment">formative research</a>, and Fisch described as "detailed or stated in terms of measurable outcomes". The program's creative staff was concerned that this goal would limit creativity, but one of the seminar results was to encourage the show's producers to use child-development concepts in the creative process. Some <a href="Muppet">Muppet</a> characters were created during the seminars to fill specific curriculum needs. For example, <a href="Oscar%20the%20Grouch">Oscar the Grouch</a> was designed to teach children about their positive and negative emotions, and <a href="Big%20Bird">Big Bird</a> was created to provide children with opportunities to correct his "bumbling" mistakes. Lesser reported that <a href="Jim%20Henson">Jim Henson</a> had a "particular gift for creating scenes that might teach".

The show's research staff and producers conducted regularly-scheduled internal reviews and seminars to ensure that their curriculum goals were being met and to guide future production. As of 2001, ten seminars had been conducted specifically to address the <a href="literacy">literacy</a> needs of preschool children. Curriculum seminars prior to "Sesame Street's" 33rd season in 2002 resulted in a change from the show's <a href="magazine">magazine</a>-like format to a more narrative <a href="Format%20of%20Sesame%20Street">format</a>. There have been over 1,000 studies as of 2001 which examine the show's impact on children's learning and attention. Most of these studies were conducted by the CTW and remain unpublished. The most important studies that found negative effects of "Sesame Street" were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Cook">Thomas D. Cook</a> during its first two seasons. Both studies found that the show increased the educational gap between poor and middle-class children. Morrow reported that these studies had little impact on the public discussion about "Sesame Street". Another criticism was made by journalist <a href="Kay%20Hymowitz">Kay Hymowitz</a> in 1995, who reported that most of the positive research conducted on the show has been done by the CTW, and then sent to a sympathetic press. She charged that the studies conducted by the CTW "hint at advocacy masquerading as social science".

Shortly after beginning "Sesame Street", its creators developed the "CTW model": a system of planning, production, and evaluation which only emerged after the show's first season. The CTW model involved the interaction between television producers and educators, the development of a curriculum for three- to five-year-old children, formative research to shape the program, and independent <a href="Summative%20assessment">summative research</a> into what viewers learned. According to Cooney, "Without research, there would be no "Sesame Street.""

Cooney credited Palmer and his colleague at Harvard, Gerald S. Lesser, whom CTW hired to write the program's educational objectives, for bridging the gap between producers and researchers. Cooney observed of the CTW model: "From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners". She described the collaboration as an "arranged marriage".

The show's staff worked to create a non-adversarial relationship between producers and researchers; each side contributed, as Fisch stated, "its own unique perspective and expertise". Early in the planning process, production staff recognized that it was valuable to have access to researchers who could analyze children's reactions and help them improve production, and the show's writers and producers brought their instincts for and experience in children's television. Though initially skeptical about both the collaboration and the curriculum, the writers eventually came to see both as integral parts of the creative process.

When educational experts and producers in other countries approached CTW for assistance in producing their own versions of "Sesame Street", which became known as <a href="International%20co-productions%20of%20Sesame%20Street">"co-productions"</a>, a variant of the CTW model was used. The need for preschool education in each country was assessed through research and interviews with television producers, researchers, and educational experts, similar to the process followed in the US. The producers then convened a series of meetings with the experts, held in the individual countries, to create and develop a curriculum, the program's educational goals, its set, and its characters. They held meetings, at the CTW offices in New York City and in the respective country, to train the co-production team in the CTW model. Each co-production conducted formative studies before production and if possible, summative studies to test the <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a> of its curriculum.

Palmer and his team used concepts from the field of formative research, which consisted of in-house, laboratory-oriented research, to guide production and to determine whether the show held children's attention. Palmer, described by Cooney as "a founder of CTW and founder of its research function", was one of the few late-1960s academics studying children's television and its effects on learning. He was responsible for designing and executing CTW's formative research, and for working with ETS, which handled the Workshop's summative research. Palmer's work was so crucial to "Sesame Street" that author <a href="Malcolm%20Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a> asserted, "Without Ed Palmer, the show would have never lasted through the first season".

CTW's researchers were strongly influenced by <a href="behaviorism">behaviorism</a>, a popular movement in psychology during the late 1960s; therefore, many methods and tools used were primarily behavioral. Palmer developed "the distractor", which he used to test if the material shown on "Sesame Street" captured young viewers' attention. Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory and shown an episode on a television monitor and a slide show next to it. The slides would change every seven seconds; researchers recorded when the children's attention was diverted from the episode. They were able to assess almost every second of "Sesame Street" this way; if an episode captured children's interest 80–90 percent of the time, producers would air it. However, if it only worked 50 percent of the time they would change (or remove) content.

In research during later seasons of "Sesame Street", verbal measurements, in the form of letter-recognition tests, were introduced. These reinforced earlier results, providing more insight into children's knowledge, reactions, and responses than behavioral measures alone. The distractor method was modified by Workshop researchers Lewis Bernstein and Valeria Lovelace into an "eyes-on-screen" method, which collected simultaneous data from larger groups of children. Their method also tested for more "natural" distractions, such as those provided by other children in group-viewing situations; up to 15 children were tested at a time. Lovelace developed additional testing methods, described by Fisch as "state-of-the-art research design". One innovation included the "engagement measure", which recorded children's active responses to an episode, such as laughing or dancing to music.

Palmer reported that by the fourth season of the show, the episodes rarely tested below 85 percent. At least one segment, "The Man from Alphabet", despite its expense, was eliminated because it tested poorly with children. The distractor provided new insight into the way children watch television, and was part of CTW's research on its programs' effectiveness for decades. It created a body of objective data, and marked the first time that children's television viewing was studied scientifically.

CTW's early studies with the distractor found that children learned more when they watched the program carefully, or when they participated by singing or talking along. In re-tests four weeks later, it found that children retained most of what they learned. After the first three weeks, or 15 episodes, viewers and non-viewers were compared; few differences in learning were found. When both groups were tested after six weeks more differences began to appear, with viewers scoring higher than non-viewers. A two-season CTW study published in 1995 found a "significant increase" in difficulty in remembering the letter and number of the day. Based on the <a href="Intelligence">multiple-intelligence</a> theory, producers began to cluster "Sesame Street's" short films, animations, and inserts around a single topic rather than sprinkling several topics throughout a single episode.

CTW solicited the <a href="Educational%20Testing%20Service">Educational Testing Service</a> (ETS) to conduct its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant tests of the show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly and those who did not. After the first season, however, "Sesame Street" was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the <a href="experimental%20design">experimental design</a>. It solved this problem by selecting <a href="scientific%20control">control-group</a> households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.

ETS, whose prestige enhanced the credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that "Sesame Street" had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of "Sesame Street", and have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.

Despite CTW's concern that the show would widen the gap between well-to-do children and their less wealthy peers, there was no evidence that this occurred; gains made by disadvantaged children were as great as those by advantaged children. The show's positive general effects, as cited by ETS, occurred across all childhood demographics (gender, age, geographic location and <a href="socioeconomic%20status">socioeconomic status</a>). Studies conducted by ETS seemed to suggest that the program had "a significant impact on children's <a href="social%20behavior">social behavior</a>", although the evidence was not as strong as it was for cognitive effects; fewer studies exist of social behavior.

CTW enlisted Palmer, in conjunction with <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, in 1979 to conduct a study in <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> regarding the effects of "Sesame Street" on children with no exposure to other children's television programs, in order to correct for the effects of multimedia exposure on children in the US. Palmer discovered that Jamaican children's interest dropped during segments with the Muppets, possibly due to language and cultural differences; musical segments were the most effective. The children's learning increased after exposure to the show, especially letter and number recognition.

In 1995 a <a href="longitudinal%20study">longitudinal study</a> was conducted at the <a href="University%20of%20Kansas">University of Kansas</a>, the first large-scale evaluation of "Sesame Street's" cognitive effects in over twenty years. Its findings supported those of previous studies: early viewing of educational children's television appeared to contribute to children's school readiness. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, but they did not watch enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching "Sesame Street" with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching "Sesame Street" daily did not increase children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.

Other studies have been conducted about the cognitive effects of "Sesame Street". In 1990, a two-year longitudinal study found that viewing the show was a "significant predictor" of improved vocabulary regardless of family size, parent education, child gender or parental attitudes towards television. Another study conducted in 1990 looked at the effect of "Sesame Street" home videos and discovered gains in vocabulary, letter, and printed- and spoken-word identification. The videos encouraged discussion with adults, which may have helped reinforce educational messages and content.

In 1994, research was conducted for "The Recontact Study", funded by the <a href="Markle%20Foundation">Markle Foundation</a>, which examined the effects of "Sesame Street" on adolescents who had watched the show as young children. The subjects had participated in previous studies as preschoolers. When the study's research subjects were <a href="Equating">statistically equated</a> for parents' level of education, birth order, residence and gender, it found that adolescents who had watched "Sesame Street" as preschoolers were positively influenced by it. Compared with children who had not watched it regularly, they had higher grades in English, math, and science; read for pleasure more often; perceived themselves as more competent, and expressed lower levels of aggression. The effects were stronger in adolescent boys than in adolescent girls.

In early 2001, the Workshop conducted a summative study about the effects of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children. It demonstrated that little was being done to address the fears and concerns of victims of traumatic events. As a result, the Workshop developed a series of materials it believed would help children (and their families) cope with events such as the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 terrorist attacks</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>.

"Sesame Street" has been used to test the attention span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown "Sesame Street" clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the "Sesame Street" material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at "Sesame Street" materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.

In 2010, researchers at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> studied the effect of combining video clips of "Sesame Street" and related print materials, online activities, and teacher training and mentoring on learning. They demonstrated that all the subjects they tested at <a href="Head%20Start%20program">Head Start program</a>s in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> scored the same as a middle-class control group in tests later given to both groups.

Hemmema

A hemmema (from <a href="Finnish%20language">Finnish</a> "Hämeenmaa", <a href="Tavastia%20%28historical%20province%29">Tavastia</a>) was a type of warship built for the Swedish <a href="archipelago%20fleet">archipelago fleet</a> and the Russian Baltic navy in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The hemmema was initially developed for use against the <a href="Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a> in the <a href="Archipelago%20Sea">Archipelago Sea</a> and along the coasts of <a href="Svealand">Svealand</a> and <a href="Finland">Finland</a>. It was designed by the prolific and innovative Swedish naval architect <a href="Fredrik%20Henrik%20af%20Chapman">Fredrik Henrik af Chapman</a> (1721–1808) in collaboration with <a href="Augustin%20Ehrensv%C3%A4rd">Augustin Ehrensvärd</a> (1710–1772), an artillery officer and later commander of the Swedish archipelago fleet. The hemmema was a specialized vessel for use in the shallow waters and narrow passages that surround the thousands of islands and islets extending from the Swedish capital of <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> into the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a>.

The hemmema replaced the <a href="galley">galley</a>s that had made up the core of the Swedish archipelago fleets until the mid-18th century. Compared to galleys, the hemmema had a deeper <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> and was slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for the crew, carried more stores, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times as many heavy guns. It could be propelled by either sails or oars but was still smaller and more maneuverable than most sailing warships, which made it suitable for operations in confined waters.

Between 1764 and 1809, Sweden built six hemmemas. The hemmema became the largest and most heavily armed vessel in the archipelago fleet and served in the <a href="Russo-Swedish%20War%20%281788%E2%80%9390%29">Russo-Swedish War</a> of 1788–90. "Oden", the first hemmema, was relatively small and very similar to a <a href="turuma">turuma</a>, a different type of "archipelago frigate". Russia built six hemmemas based on the Swedish design between 1808 and 1823 after capturing three of the Swedish vessels at the surrender of <a href="Suomenlinna">Sveaborg</a> in 1808. The later versions, both Swedish and Russian, were much larger and much more heavily armed than "Oden".

Russian Tsar <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter the Great</a> had established a new capital and powerful naval base in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> in 1703. <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> naval power in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> grew to challenge the interests of Sweden, the other leading power in the Baltic. <a href="Swedish%20Empire">Swedish holdings</a> at that time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a>, a dominion depending on, and connected by, the Baltic Sea trade routes. During the <a href="Great%20Northern%20War">Great Northern War</a> (1700–1721), Sweden lost all its territories in the Baltic states and suffered Russian raids in Finland and along the chain of islands and <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>s stretching from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a> to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. The Swedes began to deploy inshore flotillas of shallow-draft vessels, beginning with smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean <a href="galley">galley</a>s. Most of these new vessels were more akin to <a href="galiot">galiot</a>s and were complemented with gun <a href="Pram%20%28ship%29">prams</a>. The disastrous <a href="Russo-Swedish%20War%20%281741%E2%80%9343%29">war with Russia</a> (1741–43) and the minor involvement against <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> (1757–62) showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.

Galleys were effective as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially in relation to their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder <a href="cannon">cannon</a> and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. The galleys also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of <a href="hypothermia">exposure</a> during the war of 1741–43.

After the Russian victory against Sweden in 1743, the Swedes established a commission to identify weaknesses in the eastern defenses. In 1747, the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern Finland needed to be improved and expanded, and that Sweden needed to build a strong coastal navy. <a href="Augustin%20Ehrensv%C3%A4rd">Augustin Ehrensvärd</a> (1710–72), an artillery officer, was the driving force behind these changes. The committee based many of its conclusions and decisions on his ideas. In 1756, Sweden established the <a href="archipelago%20fleet">archipelago fleet</a> with the official name "arméns flotta" ("fleet of the army") under the command of the army department, <a href="Krigskollegium">Krigskollegium</a>, with Ehrensvärd as supreme commander. For two decades, the struggle for power between the <a href="Hats%20%28party%29">Hats</a> and the <a href="Caps%20%28party%29">Caps</a>, the dominant political factions at the time, and rivalries between army and navy brought about changes to the archipelago fleet. The parliamentary victory of the Hats in the <a href="Riksdag">Riksdag</a> in 1769–70 and the coup d'ètat by King <a href="Gustav%20III%20of%20Sweden">Gustav III</a> in 1772 secured the archipelago fleet's status as an independent branch of the army. Starting in 1770, the archipelago fleet merged with the Finnish Squadron ("Finska eskadern") based at <a href="Suomenlinna">Sveaborg</a>. In 1777, it incorporated the Swedish Squadron ("Svenska eskadern"), the galley fleet based at Stockholm. The Swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new army branch and made it a professional, independent organization. The archipelago fleet attracted members of the social and cultural elite who enjoyed the protection and patronage of King Gustav III, who had established himself as an <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarch</a> in the 1772 coup.
After the poor performance of galleys in Russo–Swedish war of 1741–43 and the <a href="Pomeranian%20War">Pomeranian War</a> (1757–62), development of replacements became prioritized. During the Pomeranian War, trials had been made with "gun prams" ("skottpråmar"), heavily armed, oar-driven, flat-bottomed <a href="barge">barge</a>s with a shallow draft that carried guns in <a href="broadside">broadside</a> arrangements. The prams carried more guns than the galleys, but proved far too slow to be effective. Augustin Ehrensvärd argued for new archipelago vessels that combined firepower, maneuverability, seaworthiness, and decent crew accommodations. He began a successful collaboration with shipwright Fredrik Henrik Chapman (ennobled "af Chapman" in 1772), and together they developed five new vessels: a <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> with a 12-pounder gun and a <a href="schooner">schooner</a> rigging, as well as four types of "archipelago frigates" ("skärgårdsfregatter"): the smaller <a href="udema">udema</a> and <a href="pojama">pojama</a>, and the larger <a href="turuma">turuma</a> and hemmema. All four types have been called "skärgårdsfregatter" (archipelago frigates) in Swedish and English historical literature, though some authors have called the udema and pojama "archipelago corvettes". Chapman specifically designed the archipelago frigates for service off the south coast of Finland and named them after the Finnish provinces of <a href="Uusimaa">Uusimaa</a>, "Pohjanmaa" (<a href="Ostrobothnia%20%28historical%20province%29">Österbotten</a>), "Turunmaa" (<a href="%C3%85boland">Åboland</a>), and "Hämeenmaa" (<a href="Tavastia%20%28historical%20province%29">Tavastia</a>).

The concept of small sailing frigates with a complementary set of oars (or "sweeps") was not new. The English <a href="Tudor%20navy">Tudor navy</a> had used small "<a href="galleass">galleass</a>es" in the mid-16th century. In the 1660s its successor, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, equipped the equivalent of <a href="sixth-rate">sixth-rate</a>s with oar ports on or below the gundeck. During the 18th century the Russian Navy introduced "shebecks", Baltic variants on the Mediterranean <a href="xebec">xebec</a>s, for inshore duties. The xebecs were good sailers, could be rowed if necessary and had more guns and greater stores than galleys; they were also less expensive to maintain. The Russian designs influenced Chapman and the Swedish naval commanders. Consequently, Chapman's designs for new ships were elaborations on those principles, but with adaptations to archipelago warfare.

Chapman's archipelago frigates provided better protection for their crew than the galleys they replaced, and up to three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around <a href="Skerry">skerries</a> in all weathers and in open water in all but the worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient <a href="fire%20support">fire support</a> in <a href="Amphibious%20warfare">amphibious operations</a>.

Of the new designs, turumas and hemmemas best fit the description of "archipelago frigate" because of their similarities to small ocean-going frigates. The first hemmema, the "Oden", was completed in 1764. It was c. 33 m (108.2 ft) long and 8.2 m (26.8 ft) wide with a draft of 2.8 m (9.25 ft). It had a low hull with no forecastle, only a low quarterdeck, and no <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a>. It had three masts that were initially rigged with <a href="lateen">lateen</a> sails, like a galley. The navy later replaced the lateen rigs with a more conventional square-sail frigate rig. The early design provided for 14 pairs of oars with four men per oar. The rowers plied their oars from the gun deck through oar ports positioned between the gunports, close to the waterline, which gave the rowers better leverage. The oars were also placed on a rectangular outrigger, designed to further improve the leverage. Even so, hemmemas performed poorly when rowed and were difficult in contrary winds. They were slower than ordinary sailing ships, but sailed better than galleys.

During the <a href="Russo-Swedish%20War%20%281788%E2%80%9390%29">Russian war of 1788–1790</a>, Sweden built three hemmemas of a new design. They were considerably larger, 44.5  by 11 m (146 by 36 ft), and the number of oars were increased to 20 pairs. They also had some of the heaviest broadsides, even when compared with the much larger frigates of the high seas navy. The artillery officer Carl Fredrik Aschling had cooperated with Chapman to increase the main armament to twenty-two 36-pounders and two 12-pounders, which increased the draft by about 30 cm (1 ft). The addition of diagonal <a href="timber%20framing">bracers</a> to reinforce the hull allowed the later hemmemas to carry guns more powerful even than those on the largest sailing frigates of the high seas navy. Due to their considerable firepower and relative size, naval historian <a href="Jan%20Glete">Jan Glete</a> has described the hemmemas as "super archipelago frigates".
The hemmema's design was very similar to that of the turuma. The primary difference was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were considerably larger, more heavily armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.

Hemmemas served in the Finnish squadrons during the <a href="Russo-Swedish%20War%20%281788%E2%80%9390%29">war of 1788–1790</a>. They supported amphibious operations and conducted raids on the Russian archipelago fleet, while at the same time acting as sea-borne flank support for the Swedish army on the Finnish mainland. Hemmemas fought in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Svensksund">first</a> and <a href="battle%20of%20Svensksund">second battles of Svensksund</a>. During the first battle in 1789, one hemmema complemented the similar turumas, and in the second battle in July 1790, two hemmemas made up the defensive center and provided a considerable percentage of the firepower.

The Swedes were building three additional hemmemas at the shipyards within the fortress of <a href="Suomenlinna">Sveaborg</a> when it was surrendered to the Russians in 1808, and all three were incorporated in the Russian Navy. Shortly afterward, the Russian Navy built its own 32-gun versions, with the final vessel launched as late as 1823. Two more were built in Sweden in 1809, "Birger Jarl" and "Erik Segersäll". "Birger Jarl" sank in an accident in 1813 and "Erik Segersäll" was planned for conversion as a <a href="Paddle%20wheel">paddlewheel</a> steam battery for coastal defense, though the idea was eventually abandoned and the ship scrapped in 1826.

Like the other specialized archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, it was still difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema had the potential to be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.

A total of twelve hemmemas were built, six of them for the Swedish archipelago fleet and six for the Russian Navy. Details of individual vessels are listed below. The Swedish hemmemas were all built to the same specifications, except for the early design "Oden", and "Birger Jarl" and "Erik Segersäll" carried heavier armament than the others. Tredrea and Sozaev list "Oden" as a <a href="turuma">turuma</a> rebuilt as a hemmema in 1784, though Oscar Nikula and Lars-Otto Berg do not. The Russian vessels were built between 1808 and 1823 and have been described by Tredea and Sozaev as "Bodryi"-class "rowing frigates".

Under the Finnish form "Hämeenmaa", the name of the ship type was later carried on to <a href="H%C3%A4meenmaa%20%28disambiguation%29">several vessels</a> of the 20th century <a href="Finnish%20Navy">Finnish Navy</a>.

S&amp;M (song)

"S&M" is a song by Barbadian singer <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a> from her fifth studio album, "<a href="Loud%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">Loud</a>" (2010). The song was released on January 21, 2011, as the fourth single from the album. The American songwriter <a href="Ester%20Dean">Ester Dean</a> wrote "S&M" in collaboration with the producers <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">Stargate</a> and <a href="Sandy%20Vee">Sandy Vee</a>. Backed by <a href="Beat%20%28music%29">bass beats</a>, a <a href="Electronic%20keyboard">keyboard</a> and guitars, it is an <a href="uptempo">uptempo</a> <a href="hi-NRG">hi-NRG</a>-<a href="Electro-pop">Electro-pop</a> track with lyrics about <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>, <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a>, <a href="Bondage%20%28sexual%29">bondage</a>, and <a href="sexual%20fetishism">fetishes</a>.

Critical response to "S&M" was mixed: some critics praised its sound and composition while others criticized its overtly sexual lyrics. After it reached number two on the United States' <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart, a remix that features <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a> was released. When combined with sales of the solo version, it became Rihanna's tenth and Spears' fifth number-one single on the chart. It has been certified triple platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). "S&M" peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Israel, and Poland in addition to the United States while peaking within the top five in France, Germany, Ireland, Spain, and the UK.

To promote "S&M", Rihanna performed a shortened version at the <a href="2011%20Brit%20Awards">31st Brit Awards</a> and sang the remix with Spears at the 2011 <a href="2011%20Billboard%20Music%20Awards">"Billboard" Music Awards</a>. <a href="Melina%20Matsoukas">Melina Matsoukas</a> directed the song's music video, which was, in part, Rihanna's response to disparaging critics. It portrays <a href="Softcore%20pornography">softcore</a> sadomasochist acts and fetishes. The music video was banned in many countries and restricted to nighttime television in others. Critics complimented Rihanna's sensuality and the vibrant colors. Photographer <a href="David%20LaChapelle">David LaChapelle</a> filed a lawsuit alleging that the video incorporates ideas from his photographs. Rihanna and LaChapelle settled the case for an undisclosed sum of money.

"S&M" was written by <a href="Ester%20Dean">Ester Dean</a> in collaboration with the song's producers, <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">Stargate</a> and <a href="Sandy%20Vee">Sandy Vee</a>. Dean explained its conception and the sexually suggestive lyrics to Gail Mitchell of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>": "The first thing that came to me was 'Come on, come on.' I'm thinking, 'I don't know what in the hell this is about to be.' And I remembered I'd seen something that said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones.' Then came 'But chains and whips excite me.' When people have a great track that speaks to me, it feels like it already has a story in it". Rihanna told "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" about her interest in <a href="Bondage%20%28sexual%29">bondage</a> and other <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a> activities, themes central to "S&M": "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive ... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. You get to be a little lady, to have somebody be macho and in charge."

"S&M" was recorded during Rihanna's <a href="Last%20Girl%20on%20Earth%20Tour">Last Girl on Earth Tour</a>: the instrumental parts for the song were recorded by Eriksen and Miles Walker at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and the <a href="Westlake%20Recording%20Studios">Westlake Recording Studios</a> in Los Angeles, and by Vee at The Bunker Studios in Paris. Rihanna's vocals were recorded by <a href="Kuk%20Harrell">Kuk Harrell</a> and were produced by Harrell, Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar; Bobby Campbell assisted in the singer's vocal recording. <a href="Veronika%20Bozeman">Veronika Bozeman</a> provided additional vocal production. The song was mixed by Vee at The Bunker Studios and by <a href="Phil%20Tan">Phil Tan</a> at The Ninja Beat Club in Atlanta, Georgia; additional and assistant engineering was carried out by Damien Lewis. All instrumental production was completed by Eriksen, Hermansen and Vee.

"S&M" is an <a href="uptempo">uptempo</a> <a href="hi-NRG">hi-NRG</a>-<a href="Electro-pop">Electro-pop</a> song that lasts four minutes and three seconds. The song is composed in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="E-flat%20minor">E-flat minor</a> using <a href="Time%20signature">common time</a> and a moderate dance <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 128 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. Instrumentation is provided by <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s, a <a href="Electronic%20keyboard">keyboard</a> and a <a href="guitar">guitar</a>. Chris Ryan of MTV described the song as a "steady-rocking dance track, with ominous, snarling keyboard sounds."

During the track, Rihanna's vocal range spans one <a href="octave">octave</a>, from the low note of B to the high note of B. Proposing illicit acts, she uses a "sexually aggressive tone" in her vocal performance. The lyrics are about sex, sadomasochism, bondage and <a href="BDSM">BDSM</a> fetishes, including the <a href="Sexual%20fantasy">sexual fantasies</a> and <a href="Sexual%20arousal">turn-ons</a> of its protagonist. The song opens with the <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hook</a>, "Na, na, na, c'mon". During the <a href="Refrain">chorus</a> the lyrics include, "'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it / Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it." In the song, Rihanna describes herself as "bad" and openly praises her own sexual prowess; lyrics include, "<a href="Sticks%20and%20Stones%20%28nursery%20rhyme%29">Sticks and stones may break my bones</a> / But chains and whips excite me." Rihanna told <a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">"Spin"</a> magazine that the lyrics are metaphoric. She said that she thought the song was mainly about having confidence in one's identity, and about being impervious to rumors and criticism. According to Jake Conway of "Q Magazine at Yale", the lyrics are guilty of "divesting sex of emotion" and re-envisaging violence as fetish; he went on to say that Rihanna pays homage to the sexual acts in an empowered dance and club mood. Chris Ryan described the song as being about "dirty, naughty, illicit bedroom activities".

"S&M" was the fourth single from the album "<a href="Loud%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">Loud</a>" to be released in the US and the third in other countries. It was sent to <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit</a> and <a href="Rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic</a> radio stations in the US on January 23, 2011,<ref name="US Mainstream/Rhythmic Release">"S&M" was released for Mainstream/Rhythmic airplay on January 23, 2011:
</ref> and to <a href="Urban%20contemporary">urban</a> playlists on February 27, 2011. The single was released on <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>s throughout Europe and South America on February 11, 2011. In Argentina, Brazil and certain territories throughout Europe, the song was released as an <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> (EP) on February 18, 2011; this consisted of the single version of "S&M" and two remixes by <a href="Dave%20Aud%C3%A9">Audé</a> and <a href="Sidney%20Samson">Samson</a>. On February 28, 2011, a compilation was released worldwide as a digital package consisting of remixes by <a href="DJ">disc jockeys</a> Audé, Samson and Joe Bermudez. "S&M" was released as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a> in Germany on March 18, 2011. On April 11, 2011, the remix single featuring <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a> was made available to download worldwide. In the United Kingdom, "S&M" was deemed too explicit for daytime airplay; it was edited to remove references to sex, chains and whips, and was renamed "Come On" for <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>.

A remix of "S&M" featuring rapper <a href="J.%20Cole">J. Cole</a> was released on the internet on January 17, 2011. After the release of the song's album version, Rihanna asked her followers on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> about potential collaborators, of which Spears was the most popular choice. Twitter messages between the two artists caused speculation that they had recorded a remix of the song. The remix, featuring guest vocals and a verse written by Spears, was released on April 11, 2011.

"S&M" received mixed responses from music critics. Sal Cinquemani of <a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a> described "S&M" as an ode to sadomasochism that compares to <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Velvet%20Rope">The Velvet Rope</a>". Conner felt that "S&M", as well as other "Loud" tracks "<a href="What%27s%20My%20Name%3F%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">What's My Name?</a>" and "<a href="Skin%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Skin</a>", were songs which allowed Rihanna to boast about how good she is in certain situations, as she did on "Rated R". He chose the lyrics "I may be bad/ but I'm perfectly good at it... Chains and whips excite me" as an example of her <a href="Boasting">vaunt</a>. "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"s Steve Jones opined that ""Loud"s pulsating opener, 'S&M,' makes it clear from the jump where [Rihanna is] headed as she acknowledges that 'chains and whips excite [her]'", while Leah Greenblatt of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" called "S&M" an "explicitly carnal opener" with "late-night-<a href="Cinemax">Cinemax</a> naughtiness".

Jake Conway of "Q Magazine at Yale" agreed, writing that the lyrics of "S&M" display why the singer continues to be one of the most provocative recording artists in the music industry, highlighting how she "turns the tables on abusive ex-lover Chris Brown." <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>'s Nick Levine gave the song a rating of four stars out of five, and wrote that the song makes the listener as "up-for it" as Rihanna herself; he went on to say that "S&M" consists of "ear-<a href="frot">frot</a>ting" hooks, synths and pounding beats. James Skinner of <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a> wrote that "Loud" lacked the "chart-friendly moments" of "Rated R" and criticized the overtly sexual lyrics which he found "at odds with" the flirtatious appeal for which Rihanna was aiming. Skinner described the singer's vocal delivery as "forced" and criticized her for not projecting a "daring" or convincing sound on "S&M".

"S&M" made its first chart appearance in the United Kingdom on November 15, 2010, at number 55. It peaked at number three on March 5, 2011, where it remained for three consecutive weeks. It was more successful on the <a href="UK%20R%26amp%3BB%20Chart">UK R&B Chart</a>, where it was number one for five consecutive weeks. The song the second-biggest selling R&B or hip hop single of 2011 in the UK: by December that year, "S&M" had sold 643,000 copies in the UK and was certified platinum by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">BPI</a>. Elsewhere in Europe, "S&M" was a commercial success and peaked within the top three in many countries.

"S&M" debuted on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Australian Singles Chart</a> at number 87 on November 29, 2010, upon the release of "Loud". When it was released as a single, it returned to the singles chart at number 27 on January 30, 2011. The song peaked at number one on February 13, 2011, for five non-consecutive weeks. It has since been certified four times platinum by the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a>, denoting shipments of over 280,000 copies of the single. The song debuted on the <a href="Official%20New%20Zealand%20Music%20Chart">New Zealand Singles Chart</a> at number six on February 7, 2011. It peaked at number two the following week for two consecutive weeks, and returned to its peak position again in its fifth week on the chart. "S&M" was subsequently certified platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">Recording Industry Association of New Zealand</a>, denoting sales of over 15,000 copies.

In the US, the song debuted at number 53 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> on December 4, 2010. The issue of "Billboard" published on April 30, 2011 reported that the album version of "S&M" and its official remix featuring Spears had sold a combined total of 293,000 downloads in the previous week; it replaced <a href="Katy%20Perry">Katy Perry</a>'s "<a href="E.T.%20%28song%29">E.T.</a>" on the Hot 100. "S&M" became Rihanna's tenth US number-one single on the chart, tying her with Janet Jackson in fourth place for female soloists who have topped that chart; with only four years, eleven months and two weeks between her first and tenth number one on the chart, Rihanna achieved the milestone faster than any other solo artist. It became Spears' fifth number-one single on the Hot 100. "S&M" became Rihanna's eighth number-one song on the <a href="Mainstream%20Top%2040%20%28Pop%20Songs%29">Pop Songs</a> chart and she became the artist with the most number one songs in the chart's nineteen-year history. The song was number one on the <a href="Dance%20Club%20Songs">Dance Club Songs</a> chart, and number 33 on the <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">Hot Latin Songs</a> chart. It debuted at number 80 on the <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> in the February 26, 2011 issue of "Billboard", and peaked at number 59. "S&M" peaked at number 24 on the <a href="Adult%20Top%2040">Adult Pop Songs</a> chart, and at number 14 on the <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Airplay">Latin Pop Songs</a> chart. The song has been certified triple platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA), and has sold 3,837,000 digital copies in the US . "S&M" ranked at number 15 on "Billboard's" "Best of 2011 – Pop Songs" chart, and number two on its "Best of 2011 – Dance/Club Songs" chart. In Canada, the song peaked at number one for the week of April 21, 2011.

The director <a href="Melina%20Matsoukas">Melina Matsoukas</a> filmed the music video for "S&M" in Los Angeles on January 15 and 16, 2011. Matsoukas told "Billboard" that the video was inspired by Rihanna's "sadomasochist relationship with the press ... it isn't just about a bunch of whips and chains." On January 27, 2011, a behind-the-scenes clip was posted on Rihanna's <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channel, and the full music video premiered on <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a> on February 1, 2011.

As the video opens, Rihanna is dragged into a press conference, where she is covered with plastic wrap and taped to a wall. Microphones and <a href="Gag%20%28BDSM%29">gagged</a> reporters surround her. In an outdoor scene, she wears a cream-colored <a href="latex">latex</a> dress and leads a gagged <a href="Perez%20Hilton">Perez Hilton</a> around by a dog leash. Rihanna is then shown seated and surrounded by CCTV surveillance cameras; her chair begins to rotate, and she stands and begins to whip reporters, who are taped to the wall of the room. She then rolls on the floor, her hands and feet bound with rope. As the <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a> of the song approaches, Rihanna wears a white latex bikini and rabbit ears, while images of headlines are projected against her body and the wall behind her. After the chorus, she appears in a newsroom. Reporters take photographs of her while she sprawls across a desk wearing a pink latex dress. Scenes of Rihanna and others in bondage gear are interspersed with images of the singer wearing a feather boa and a <a href="tube%20top">tube top</a> with "censored" printed across it. The video then alternates between previous scenes and images in which Rihanna eats bananas, strawberries and cream, and jewel-covered ice cream. In the final scene, she lies on a newsroom desk, with a smiley face emblem over one eye and a <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a> tongue logo over her mouth. Drag queens <a href="Willam%20Belli">Willam Belli</a>, <a href="Detox%20Icunt">Detox Icunt</a>, and <a href="Morgan%20McMichaels">Morgan McMichaels</a> appear in the video.

The music video was generally well received. A journalist for "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" wrote, "Rihanna is perfectly good at being bad – and this video proves it", while a reviewer for "<a href="OK%21">OK!</a>" called the video "red-hot, kinky and totally tongue-in-cheek". Willa Paskin of "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" similarly described it as a "goofy" take on the S&M-themed music videos typical of <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> and <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a>, while Matthew Perpetua of "Rolling Stone" described the video as a "visual onslaught of candy-colored kinkiness" that viewers would enjoy despite its bright colors and sexually suggestive activities. Brad Wete of "Entertainment Weekly" stated that Rihanna delivered the risque video he was expecting based on the song's lyrical content, and Jason Lipshutz of "Billboard" praised the video's "exquisite set pieces that offer a twisted take on hardcore sexuality".

The video was immediately banned in eleven countries due to its overtly sexual content. It was flagged and age-restricted on YouTube for having mature content, although this restriction has since been lifted. Rihanna responded to the news via Twitter, writing, "They watched '<a href="Umbrella%20%28song%29">Umbrella</a>' ... I was full nude". An unrestricted version of the video was later uploaded to Rihanna's official website. Melina Matsoukas responded to the news in an interview with <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a>, stating: "When I go out to make something, I kind of go out with the intention to get it banned – [well] not to get it banned ... but to make something provocative ... it's making an effect and people are having a dialogue about it, so, to me, that's successful."

The video was involved in further controversy when photographer <a href="David%20LaChapelle">David LaChapelle</a> sued Rihanna, <a href="Island%20Def%20Jam">Island Def Jam</a> and related parties for <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a>. LaChapelle alleged that the video infringed upon eight of his photographs published between 1997 and 2010 in "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>", "<a href="i-D">i-D</a>", "<a href="Vogue%20Italia">Vogue Italia</a>" and elsewhere. The lawsuit, which claimed unspecified damages, alleged that the video was "directly derived" from LaChapelle's pictures, copying their "composition, total concept, feel, tone, mood, theme, colors, props, settings, decors, wardrobe and lighting". The lawsuit included claims of <a href="trade%20dress">trade dress</a> infringement under the <a href="Lanham%20Act">Lanham Act</a>, <a href="unfair%20competition">unfair competition</a> under New York state law and <a href="unjust%20enrichment">unjust enrichment</a>, all of which were later dismissed. Judge <a href="Shira%20A.%20Scheindlin">Shira A. Scheindlin</a> of New York's Southern District Court denied a <a href="motion%20to%20dismiss">motion to dismiss</a> the copyright violation allegations, noting similarities between the works:

In August 2011, a judge agreed that the "pink room scene', which shows Rihanna dominating a man in front of pink and white striped walls, was very similar to LaChapelle's "Striped Face" photograph; the judge pinpointed a scene where Rihanna is seen against a blue background, wearing pink latex and placing a sweet on her tongue." Rihanna and LaChapelle settled the case out of court for an undisclosed sum. After the case, LaChapelle said the lawsuit was "not personal, it's strictly business", and that "musicians commonly pay to sample music or use someone's beats and there should be no difference when sampling an artist's visuals." In June 2011, German photographer Philipp Paulus sued Rihanna and her record labels, alleging further copyright violations with regard to a scene in the music video where Rihanna wears an expansive dress and is taped to the wall with a plastic sheet in front of her. According to Paulus, Rihanna and Matsoukas appropriated the image from his photographic series "Paperworld."

Rihanna first performed "S&M" at the <a href="2011%20BRIT%20Awards">BRIT Awards</a> on February 15, 2011, as part of a medley which incorporated two of her previous singles from "Loud", "<a href="Only%20Girl%20%28In%20the%20World%29">Only Girl (In the World)</a>" and "What's My Name?". Rihanna had planned to perform "S&M" only, to coincide with its release as a single in the United Kingdom, but she was instructed by the BRIT Awards corporation to "tone down the sexual references in the song's lyrics". The singer was reported to be angered at being requested to change her act and that she was asked to consider performing a different song instead. She changed the arrangement because the BRIT Awards corporation wanted to avoid complaints similar to those received following the finale of the <a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%20series%207%29">seventh series</a> of <a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%29">"The X Factor"</a>, on December 11, 2010. Rihanna was criticized for wearing a provocative outfit and for performing a suggestive dance routine on "The X Factor", branded as "disgusting", before the <a href="Watershed%20%28television%29">watershed</a>, a system in the United Kingdom which does not allow adult content to be broadcast before 9 pm.
Rihanna opened the <a href="2011%20Billboard%20Music%20Awards">2011 "Billboard" Music Awards</a> with a performance of the "S&M" remix with Spears on May 22, 2011, at the <a href="MGM%20Grand%20Garden%20Arena">MGM Grand Garden Arena</a> in Las Vegas. Rihanna and Spears wore bondage-style bodysuits; Rihanna's outfit was white, and she wore PVC thigh-high boots. Spears wore a black outfit, a mask and rabbit ears; both singers wore handcuffs. Rihanna began the performance seated and provocatively opened her legs as she simulated whipping sounds. The singers closed the performance with pole dancing, a pillow fight and a kiss on the cheek. "Billboard" magazine declared the performance as one of the 15 Awesome Performances at the Billboard Music Awards. Rihanna performed "S&M" on May 27, 2011, on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">Today</a>" show's "Summer Concert Series", along with "Only Girl (in the World)", "What's My Name?" and "<a href="California%20King%20Bed">California King Bed</a>". She gave an interview about the album and about her controversial performance at the "Billboard" Music Awards with Spears. When Rihanna was asked if she was surprised at the controversial reaction the performance prompted, she responded:

The song was included on the set list of the <a href="Loud%20Tour">Loud Tour</a>, which began with the stage decorated as a stylized S&M set. The singer performed <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>'s "<a href="Darling%20Nikki">Darling Nikki</a>" with three semi-nude female dancers whom she spanked, groped and pretended to smack with a cane. "Darling Nikki" then transitioned into "S&M" and she took off her white tuxedo, revealing a white bondage corset and handcuffs. "S&M" was featured on the set list of Spears' <a href="Femme%20Fatale%20Tour">Femme Fatale Tour</a> (2011), as part of a medley with "<a href="...Baby%20One%20More%20Time%20%28song%29">...Baby One More Time</a>". Rihanna performed "S&M" at <a href="Radio%201%27s%20Big%20Weekend%232012">Radio 1's Hackney Weekend</a> on May 24, 2012, as the third song on the set list. The song was included on most of Rihanna's <a href="Unapologetic%23777%20Tour">777 Tour</a> in November 2012; a seven-date and seven-day-long promotional tour in support of the release of her seventh studio album, "<a href="Unapologetic">Unapologetic</a>".

In 2011, "S&M" was featured at the beginning of the <a href="Hawaii%20Five-0%20%282010%20TV%20series%2C%20season%201%29%23Episodes">seventeenth episode</a> of the American <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> <a href="drama">drama</a> TV series, "<a href="Hawaii%20Five-0%20%282010%20TV%20series%29">Hawaii Five-0</a>". <a href="Lee%20Latchford-Evans">Lee Latchford-Evans</a> of the British group <a href="Steps%20%28group%29">Steps</a> covered the song as part of a medley with <a href="Maroon%205">Maroon 5</a> and <a href="Christina%20Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>'s song "<a href="Moves%20like%20Jagger">Moves like Jagger</a>" in his solo section of <a href="The%20Ultimate%20Tour%20%28Steps%29">The Ultimate Tour</a> (2012). In the 2012 <a href="musical%20comedy">musical comedy</a> film "<a href="Pitch%20Perfect">Pitch Perfect</a>", "S&M" was sung <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> by Ester Dean, <a href="Alexis%20Knapp">Alexis Knapp</a>, <a href="Anna%20Kendrick">Anna Kendrick</a>, <a href="Rebel%20Wilson">Rebel Wilson</a>, <a href="Anna%20Camp">Anna Camp</a> and <a href="Brittany%20Snow">Brittany Snow</a>. The ensemble's performance of the song appears on the film's <a href="Pitch%20Perfect%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack</a> as part of a medley, "Riff Off". "Riff Off" was released as a single in 2012 and reached number 86 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. The soundtrack also became the number one album on the US <a href="Billboard%20charts">Top Soundtracks</a>.

2010 United States Senate Democratic primary election in Pennsylvania

The Democratic primary for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Pennsylvania%2C%202010">2010 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania</a> took place on May 18, 2010, when Congressman <a href="Joe%20Sestak">Joe Sestak</a> defeated incumbent <a href="Arlen%20Specter">Arlen Specter</a>, which led to the end of Specter's five-term Senatorial career. Just prior to the start of the primary campaign, after serving in the Senate as a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> for 29 years, Specter had switched to the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> in anticipation of a difficult primary challenge by <a href="Pat%20Toomey">Pat Toomey</a>; Sestak was ultimately defeated by Toomey in the general election. Political observers and journalists described the race between Specter and Sestak as one of the bitterest and most watched of all the 2010 primary elections.

Although Sestak was initially urged to run by the Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> and Pennsylvania Governor <a href="Ed%20Rendell">Ed Rendell</a> later tried to sway Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances in the general election. Former President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> offered Sestak a position in the Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low <a href="name%20recognition">name recognition</a> and Specter's support from such individuals as <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a> and <a href="Harry%20Reid">Harry Reid</a>, and organizations like the <a href="AFL-CIO">AFL-CIO</a> and <a href="Pennsylvania%20Democratic%20Party">Pennsylvania Democratic Committee</a>.

Specter led Sestak by more than 20 percentage points for most of the race, but this lead narrowed significantly in the final month of the campaign, when Sestak concentrated his funds and efforts on <a href="campaign%20advertising">television commercials</a> questioning Specter's Democratic credentials. Specter grew more critical of Sestak as the race progressed, attacking his House attendance record, accusing him of failing to pay his staffers <a href="Minimum%20wage%20in%20the%20United%20States">minimum wage</a> and alleging he was demoted while serving in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> for creating a poor command climate. Political observers said Sestak's commercials played a major part in his victory, and that a national swing in momentum toward Republicans and against incumbents ultimately harmed Specter's chances.

Beginning in April 2008, the media reported growing speculation that <a href="Chris%20Matthews">Chris Matthews</a>, news commentator and host of <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a>'s "<a href="Hardball%20with%20Chris%20Matthews">Hardball with Chris Matthews</a>", might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> seat then occupied by the Republican <a href="Arlen%20Specter">Arlen Specter</a>. In an interview with "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a>", Matthews said that he believed Specter had been in the Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of "<a href="The%20Colbert%20Report">The Colbert Report</a>". Host <a href="Stephen%20Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, "Did you ever want to be something your whole life? ... When you grow up, some kids want to be a fireman. I want to be a Senator. But I have to deal with these things as they come." Matthews declined to directly answer questions about his possible candidacy when pressed by the media, but did not deny the possibility.

The subject of Matthews' possible candidacy was raised at an October dinner fundraiser for presidential candidate <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> held by <a href="Robert%20Wolf%20%28business%29">Robert Wolf</a>, president of <a href="UBS">UBS</a>'s investment bank. Discussing the dinner later, Matthews told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "People have asked me about it. I've never told anyone that I'm running." On November 28, "<a href="The%20Patriot-News">The Patriot-News</a>" of <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a> reported that Matthews met that week with <a href="Pennsylvania%20Democratic%20Party">Pennsylvania Democratic Party</a> Chairman <a href="T.J.%20Rooney">T.J. Rooney</a> and Executive Director <a href="Mary%20Isenhour">Mary Isenhour</a> to discuss possibly running against Specter. Isenhour told the paper Matthews had not formed a campaign committee or begun raising money, and she did not believe he had yet come to a firm decision, adding, "He's got a really good job with MSNBC. I think he's going to put some thought into it before he jumps in." The same day as that "Patriot-News" report, the political blog <a href="FiveThirtyEight.com">FiveThirtyEight.com</a> reported that Matthews had already met with potential campaign staff, something Matthews claimed was "absolutely not true".

The increased speculation led some, like former spokesman for <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>'s <a href="Hillary%20Clinton%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">2008 presidential campaign</a> Phil Singer, to criticize Matthews for openly weighing a political campaign bid while working as a news broadcaster. Singer believed Matthews should resign or be suspended from the network until a decision was made. Speculation grew as Matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with Pennsylvania representatives and major Democratic fundraisers. Matthews discussed a possible campaign with Pennsylvania Governor <a href="Ed%20Rendell">Ed Rendell</a>, and poll numbers for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind Specter. However, the speculation came to an end on January 7, 2009, when Matthews told his "Hardball" staff he was not going to run for Senate. Such media outlets as "The New York Times" and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" suggested Matthews' alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with MSNBC to renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2009.

As early as 2008, the five-term Republican Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter made clear his plans to seek re-election. Specter had narrowly avoided a primary defeat against conservative challenger <a href="Pat%20Toomey">Pat Toomey</a> during his <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Pennsylvania%2C%202004">2004 Senate race</a>, and he was expected to face an even greater challenge from Toomey in 2010, particularly since the conservative faction of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Republican%20Party">Pennsylvania Republican Party</a> had vowed to defeat Specter in the upcoming primary. Some high-profile Democrats, including Vice President <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a> and Governor Rendell, began encouraging Specter to join the Democratic Party by publicly offering to help Specter raise money if he switched. A March 2009 <a href="Quinnipiac%20University%20Polling%20Institute">Quinnipiac University Polling Institute</a> poll found Specter trailing Toomey 41 percent to 27 percent among Republican primary voters, in large part due to voter angst over Specter's support for the <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a>, which was supported by President Obama. Since the Pennsylvania primaries are closed, the poll noted that Specter could not be assisted by support from moderates or Democrats. Clay F. Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said of the poll results, "Pennsylvania Republicans are so unhappy with Sen. Specter’s vote for President Barack Obama's Stimulus Package and so-called pork barrel spending that they are voting for a former Congressman they hardly know."

The same month as the March poll, an article in "<a href="The%20Hill%20%28newspaper%29">The Hill</a>" quoted Specter as stating he was considering leaving the Republican party to run for re-election as an Independent candidate. Specter later denied the validity of those claims, announcing on March 18, "To eliminate any doubt, I am a Republican, and I am running for reelection in 2010 as a Republican on the Republican ticket." However, on April 28, 2009, Specter announced he was leaving the Republican Party and becoming a Democrat because he disagreed with the increasingly conservative direction the Republican Party was heading in and found his personal philosophy was now better aligned with the Democrats. Although Specter said that he primarily based his decision on principle, he also admitted it was partially due to his poor chances at winning the Republican primary: "I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and have found that the prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak."

Prior to switching parties, Specter was promised by Senate Majority Leader <a href="Harry%20Reid">Harry Reid</a> that he would keep his seniority on the Senate if he joined the Democratic Party. The arrangement displeased some Senate Democrats, and, on May 3, the Senate voted to strip him of his seniority despite Reid's promise. This temporarily made Specter the most junior Democrat in the Senate and severely limited his influence as a legislator. Nevertheless, Specter's decision was praised by many major Democrats, including Reid and President Barack Obama, who promised to campaign for him. Republicans, however, criticized the decision, accusing Specter of betraying his principles and party to preserve his political career. <a href="Michael%20Steele">Michael Steele</a>, chairman of the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a>, said Specter "<a href="Finger%20%28gesture%29">flipped the bird</a>" to the party and that Specter made the decision based solely because he knew he would lose the election. Senator <a href="John%20Cornyn">John Cornyn</a>, chairman of the <a href="National%20Republican%20Senatorial%20Committee">National Republican Senatorial Committee</a> and a past supporter of Specter, said the decision "represents the height of political self-preservation". Specter defended his position by arguing the Republican Party had strayed too far from the vision of President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, adding, "I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate."

Second-term U.S Representative <a href="Joe%20Sestak">Joe Sestak</a>, a former <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> admiral, began privately discussing the possibility of seeking the Democratic nomination with his family in December 2008. Senator <a href="Bob%20Menendez">Bob Menendez</a>, chairman of the <a href="Democratic%20Senatorial%20Campaign%20Committee">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a>, approached Sestak in April 2009 and asked him to run, but Sestak claimed he was not initially interested. Nevertheless, media speculation about Sestak's possible campaign began as early as mid-April 2009, and intensified the day Specter changed political parties. While most Democrats embraced the long-time Senator, Sestak issued a statement criticizing Specter's decision, declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with Pennsylvanians rather than the Senate Democratic leadership and the Washington political establishment. Menendez approached Sestak again, this time asking him not to run against Specter, but Sestak did not agree to back down. Later, when asked by <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a>, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and said he had to "wait and see". During a May 3 appearance on <a href="CNN">CNN</a>'s "<a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20with%20Candy%20Crowley">State of the Union with John King</a>", Sestak questioned whether Specter was really a genuine Democrat, adding, "I think Arlen has to tell us not that it was too hard to run against someone. ... What I need to know is, what is he running for?"
Sestak insisted he would not make a final decision for several months. On May 4, he met with <a href="Andy%20Stern">Andy Stern</a>, president of the <a href="Service%20Employees%20International%20Union">Service Employees International Union</a>, which fueled speculation that he was seeking labor support for a campaign. Meanwhile, <a href="Joe%20Torsella">Joe Torsella</a>, the former president of the <a href="National%20Constitution%20Center">National Constitution Center</a>, had planned on running for the Democratic nomination and initially announced Specter's party change would not affect his decision to run. However, Torsella announced on May 14 he was dropping out of the race because Specter's decision changed the political landscape, and he wanted to avoid a campaign that "would probably be negative, personal, and more about Senator Specter's past than our common future". It had been reported that Governor Rendell, for whom Torsella previously worked as an aide, pushed for Torsella to step aside so Specter could run unopposed, but Torsella's staff denied those claims. Despite Torsella's departure, Sestak continued to consider entering the race and began gaining support from the Democratic party's more liberal factions like the <a href="Progressive%20Change%20Campaign%20Committee">Progressive Change Campaign Committee</a>, which began a "Draft Sestak" campaign fund. Sestak became further encouraged to run after taking a tour of all 67 Pennsylvania counties to meet with party leaders and discuss such issues as jobs, the economy and health care. Sestak said that the leaders voiced serious concerns to him about the direction of the country and, although his lack of name recognition was a problem, Sestak said many of the people he encountered voiced support for him.

On May 27, the website <a href="Talking%20Points%20Memo">Talking Points Memo</a> posted a handwritten letter by Sestak to candidates declaring his intent to run for Senate. Sestak did not dispute the authenticity of the letter, but told the press he wanted to discuss the matter with his family before making a formal decision. Sestak told media outlets he realized President Obama wished him not to run against Specter, but that he felt the choice should be with the voters of Pennsylvania rather than the president. Governor Rendell overtly tried to convince him not to run, believing it would damage Sestak's own political future, plus cost the Democratic Party both Sestak's House seat and possibly damage Specter's general election chances. Nevertheless, Sestak formally declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on August 4, 2009, in a speech before a <a href="Veterans%20of%20Foreign%20Wars">Veterans of Foreign Wars</a> hall in his native <a href="Delaware%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Delaware County</a>. Shortly after the announcement, Toomey issued a statement welcoming Sestak to the race, describing him as "a consistent liberal who really believes in his values", as compared to Specter, who he called "a career political opportunist who believes in nothing but his own re-election".


<a href="Pennsylvania%20House%20of%20Representatives">Pennsylvania Rep.</a> <a href="William%20C.%20Kortz">William C. Kortz</a> and retired manufacturer Joseph Vodvarka also ran in the Democratic primary, but neither remained for the duration of the race. Kortz, who was little known outside the western Pennsylvania area, dropped out of the race on January 14, 2010 after raising only $20,000 of the $2 million he sought to raise for his campaign. Vodvarka, an <a href="Allegheny%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny County</a> man who had been mostly overlooked throughout the race, was formally removed from the ballot in mid-April 2010 after it was revealed he failed to garner the minimum amount of signatures for a nominating petition.

Both candidates started the campaign well-funded. Sestak had more than $3 million available from his House fund to use toward starting a Senate campaign, and raised an additional $1 million by June 30, 2009, which brought his total to about $4.2 million. Sestak called it the largest campaign war-chest of any Senate challenger. Specter, however, was ahead with $6.7 million in campaign funding as of March 31. Sestak also faced challenges arising from his low name recognition and Specter's support among high-profile members of the Democratic establishment, like Obama and Biden. Specter spent the early months of his campaign trying to reestablish and strengthen his Democratic credentials, seeking union support and making speeches highlighting his support of positions supported by the party, such as the economic stimulus package, reforming health care, increasing the minimum wage, protecting abortion rights and supporting <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a> research. In a June 2009 speech to Pennsylvania Democratic Committee members in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, Specter said, "I'm again a Democrat and I'm pleased and proud to be a Democrat." Commentators observed that Sestak's involvement in the race would test Specter's loyalty to the Democratic party and likely force him to make more liberal votes in the Senate.

Even before Sestak formally declared his candidacy on August 4, 2009, Specter and Sestak began exchanging criticisms about each other that were so heated, "The New York Times" writer Janie Lorber suggested "the contest will become one of the more vicious for next year's midterm elections". Sestak repeatedly said Specter was not a "real Democrat" and continued to assert Specter's switch was based on self-preservation rather than principles. Specter called Sestak a "flagrant hypocrite" for questioning Specter's loyalty to the Democratic Party, citing the fact that Sestak himself was registered as an Independent until he became a Democrat in 2006, just before he ran for Congress. Sestak claimed that was because he was serving in the military and wished to be nonpartisan, but Specter called that a "lame excuse for avoiding party affiliation ... undercut by his documented disinterest in the political process", pointing out that records indicated Sestak voted in only 12 out of 35 elections from 1971 to 2005. A day after Sestak formally entered the race, Specter described Sestak's recent 67-county tour as a "taxpayer-financed self-promotion tour around the state". Specter's campaign also accused Sestak of neglecting his duties in the House and missing more than 100 votes in the last year, which Specter called the worst attendance record for any Pennsylvania Congressman. Sestak responded to the latter point that most of the missed votes were procedural in nature, and were missed because of the statewide tour and because he visited his father, who was dying at the time. Sestak accused Specter of launching a "GOP negative style campaign", which Specter denied.

Specter and Sestak participated in an August 14 panel discussion hosted by <a href="Netroots%20Nation">Netroots Nation</a>, which included questions from online viewers consisting mainly of liberal and progressive bloggers and advocates. Media reports suggested Specter faced tougher questions from the crowd, with many questioning whether they could trust him based on his switching parties. Specter dismissed suggestions that his recent Democratic votes were politically motivated by the primary, and cited his support of the <a href="Lilly%20Ledbetter%20Fair%20Pay%20Act%20of%202009">Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act</a> and <a href="State%20Children%27s%20Health%20Insurance%20Program">Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act</a> as proof of his Democratic credentials. Sestak argued a change in leadership was necessary and that his military background as a United States Navy admiral gave him the necessary experience. Sestak also pointed out that Specter worked with former Senator <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a> to defeat President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s <a href="Clinton%20health%20care%20plan%20of%201993">health care plan</a> in 1993. When some in the crowd brought up how Senator <a href="Chuck%20Grassley">Chuck Grassley</a>, a past ally of Specter's, was arguing that Obama's <a href="Patient%20Protection%20and%20Affordable%20Care%20Act">health care plan</a> would lead to "<a href="death%20panels">death panels</a>", Specter said that Grassley was wrong and that he would call him about the matter. When some in the crowd chanted, "Call him now!", Specter took several audience members backstage and left a phone message for Grassley as they watched. <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> said based on the stunt, "Specter may have won the day, if not the battle". However, a straw poll of 250 online activists attending the event showed Sestak was preferred to Specter by a vote of 46 percent to 10 percent.
Later, following an e-mail exchange with the expected Republican challenger Toomey about health care, Sestak proposed an unorthodox joint town hall with Toomey about the issue, which was held September 2 at <a href="Muhlenberg%20College">Muhlenberg College</a> in <a href="Allentown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allentown</a>. Specter was not invited to participate, and political pollster <a href="Terry%20Madonna">G. Terry Madonna</a> of <a href="Franklin%20%26amp%3B%20Marshall%20College">Franklin & Marshall College</a> described it as an "informal pact" between Sestak and Toomey to weaken their joint rival, something the two men denied. Commentators suggested Toomey was willing to help Sestak at this stage of the race because he preferred Sestak as a general election opponent over Specter, who could possibly draw Republican and Independent voters from Toomey. Also in September, Obama appeared in a 30-second television ad for Specter, praising him for his support of the President's economic recovery initiatives. A September poll by Franklin & Marshall College found Specter maintained a 37 percent to 11 percent lead over Sestak, but also that 54 percent of people felt a change was needed as opposed to 34 percent who felt Specter deserved a sixth term. That poll also found 73 percent felt they did not know enough about Sestak to form an opinion, which pollster Madonna said indicated the race would be focused more on Specter's incumbency and record than about Sestak or Toomey.
On September 15, Obama attended a <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public declaration of support so early in the primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor <a href="Michael%20Nutter">Michael Nutter</a> and radio personality <a href="Michael%20Smerconish">Michael Smerconish</a> also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator <a href="Bob%20Casey%2C%20Jr.">Bob Casey, Jr.</a> could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, as well as from Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via <a href="Air%20Force%20One">Air Force One</a> to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the <a href="AFL-CIO">AFL-CIO</a> convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the <a href="Employee%20Free%20Choice%20Act">Employee Free Choice Act</a>, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.

As the primary entered into October, Specter continued to criticize Sestak on his record of missed votes in Congress. He claimed Sestak missed 122 in the past year, or nearly 17 percent of his total votes, whereas Specter missed four. In a letter, Specter told Sestak he should drop out of the campaign and start voting on a more consistent basis, or resign from the House "so he can cease to be a burden to the taxpayers". Around the same time, Sestak launched a website called "The Real Specter", which highlighted the right-leaning votes Specter made and alliances he held during his 29 years as a Republican in the senate. Specter continued to maintain a significant lead against Sestak of 19 percentage points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released that month. But Sestak pointed out that the gap was 32 points in July, and cited the poll as proof that he was gaining ground in the race. Also that month, new reports indicated Toomey was growing in popularity and, in one poll, was actually ahead of Specter, with 43 percent of respondents saying they would vote for him compared to 42 percent for Specter. This was attributed by some to the challenge presented by Sestak and the declining popularity of Obama, whose approval rating had dropped from 56 percent in July to 49 percent in October.

On October 14, Specter reported he had raised $1.8 million during the previous three-month period, bringing his total to about $8.7 million. The Senator said that he was aided in large part by his September 15 fundraiser hosted by Obama. In that same period, Sestak raised only $758,000, about a quarter million dollars lower than the previous quarter, making his total allocation about $4.7 million. Sestak continued working hard to overcome his name recognition problem, seldom turning down interview requests and asking his staff to work six 12-hour days a week. As a result, Sestak saw a large amount of turnover in his staff, going through nearly half a dozen press secretaries and several chiefs of staff. Sestak called on Specter participate in six debates, one for each media market in Pennsylvania, but Specter only agreed to participate in one because that was the amount of debates he participated in as a Republican. On December 7, Sestak was endorsed by Congressman <a href="Barney%20Frank">Barney Frank</a>, who said that he was impressed by Sestak's leadership on economic and military issues, as well as his positions against the military's "<a href="don%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell">don't ask, don't tell</a>" policy and the <a href="Defense%20of%20Marriage%20Act">Defense of Marriage Act</a>. The endorsement was important to Sestak because it was the first time a prominent member of Congress broke with the Democratic establishment to back him over Specter. Frank also said of Specter's switching parties, "I have to say I don't think it did our profession any good for someone to announce that he switched parties purely so he could survive."

New polls in January indicated voter support was growing for Toomey, who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over Specter and an eight-point lead over Sestak. Specter continued to lead against Sestak in the Democratic primary poll, this time by a 21-point margin. Some political scientists believed Toomey's gain over Specter could be attributed to voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction with the health care proposal pending in Congress. However, some Democratic leaders felt Sestak's challenge to Specter was having a detrimental effect not only to Specter, but to the Democratic party in general and their prospects for ultimately winning the general election. This feeling was enhanced by the growing national support for the Republican party, and especially by the unexpected victory of the <a href="Tea%20Party%20protests">Tea Party</a>-backed Republican <a href="Scott%20Brown%20%28politician%29">Scott Brown</a> in a special election for a traditionally Democratic <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> Senate seat. Specter acknowledged to "The New York Times" that the national political mood might work against him in the primary, but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence in his ability to survive.

The primary continued to grow more heated in February 2010. On February 5, the two candidates held their first face-to-face debate, and used the 30-minute forum to strongly criticize each other, with Sestak continuing to associate Specter with failed Republican policies and Specter arguing his opponent was more focused on criticizing him than debating policy. Sestak continued to attack Specter for switching parties, asking, "Is the best the Democrats can do someone who has been on the other side, with respect, for 50 years, and cast 2,000 votes with President Bush?" Likewise, Specter once again criticized Sestak's missed votes in Congress, which he said would have been enough to earn Sestak a <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> for going <a href="Absence%20without%20leave">AWOL</a> in his former Naval career. Sestak also criticized Specter for voting in favor of the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>, and Specter in turn condemned Sestak for supporting Obama's proposed troop increase for the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a>, which Specter opposed. The next day, the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee voted to endorse Specter over Sestak, with 77 percent of voters supporting the incumbent Senator, or 229 votes compared to Sestak's 72. Sestak criticized the committee for its decision, but also argued it solidified his own position as a political outsider independent from the mainstream Washington establishment. Media outlets said the vote indicated Specter had convinced most important figures in the state party that he was not simply a crossover politician.

Later in February, Specter accused Sestak of mistreating his employees and disobeying state and federal <a href="Minimum%20wage%20in%20the%20United%20States">minimum wage</a> laws by severely underpaying his House staff. Citing <a href="Federal%20Election%20Commission">Federal Election Commission</a> reports, Specter claimed ten of Sestak's sixteen campaign staffers were making less than minimum wage and that they were so underpaid they were eligible for <a href="Supplemental%20Nutrition%20Assistance%20Program">food stamps</a>. He also noted that Sestak's three highest-paid staffers were members of his family, including his brother Richard Sestak, who worked as campaign manager. T.J. Rooney, a Specter supporter, wrote a letter to Sestak expressing concern about the potential violation of minimum wage laws, which read: "It is inconceivable to me that our standard bearer wouldn’t be paying his workers the minimum wage". Sestak responded by acknowledging his staff could make more money elsewhere, but said "they choose to work hard and make some sacrifices because they know how important it is to elect someone to the United States Senate who shares their principles".

As the primary race entered into March, Specter appeared to be maintaining his momentum, with polls indicating he not only led Sestak by 24 percentage points, but had recaptured a projected lead against Toomey in the general election by a margin of 49 to 42 percent. Pollsters indicated Specter was still benefiting greatly from his strong name recognition, whereas Sestak and Toomey remained relatively little-known. Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said, "There remains no evidence that his primary challenger, Congressman Joe Sestak, has made much progress as we get within three months of the May primary." However, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" writer <a href="Karen%20Tumulty">Karen Tumulty</a> noted that while "thus far, Sestak has failed to meet expectations", the poll also indicated some weaknesses for Specter. Namely, more than half of the surveyed Pennsylvanians did not feel he deserved another term, and among Democrats who knew the candidates well enough to form an opinion of both, Sestak led Specter 54 percent to 37 percent. On March 16, Governor Rendell restated his past support of Specter and said of Sestak, "He has, in my mind, no chance to win."
On March 30, Specter won the backing of the AFL-CIO, which was considered one of the most important endorsements in the primary race. It was one of several major labor endorsements Specter had received, including the state <a href="Service%20Employees%20International%20Union">Service Employees International Union</a> and the <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Education%20Association">Pennsylvania State Education Association</a>, which represented 200,000 state teachers. Representatives from the AFL-CIO cited Specter's backing of President Obama's stimulus package as a major factor in their decision. Sestak criticized the union federation's decision, pointing out he had a 100 percent rating from the national AFL-CIO while Specter had a 61 percent rating. He also attacked Specter for previously backing President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>'s economic policies and said, "Pennsylvania workers need a Senator they can count on to be there when they need him, not only when he needs them during an election." "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" writer Thomas Fitzgerald called the endorsement "a powerful affirmation of how smoothly Specter has managed his political transition to the Democratic Party since leaving the Republican Party less than a year ago".

On April 11, Sestak held a debate with Toomey in Philadelphia without Specter present, which media observers described as an explicit criticism of Specter for refusing to hold more than one debate with Sestak. During that debate, Sestak strongly attacked Toomey's voting record in what "<a href="The%20Morning%20Call">The Morning Call</a>" reporter Colby Itkowitz described as "an obvious effort to show Democrats that he could hold his own in a general election matchup". At the end of the debate, Toomey voiced respect for Sestak and described him as a more principled man than Specter, who he criticized for not participating in more debates. Later that month, when the Senate candidates publicly released their quarterly campaign finance reports on April 15, it was revealed Toomey raised more in the first three months of 2010 than either Democratic candidate, adding $2.3 million to his total $4.1 million war chest compared to Specter adding $1.1 million to his total $9.1 million fund. Political analysts attributed this to the national swing in momentum toward Republicans, and said that it could indicate the Republicans would be victorious in many Senate races, including in Pennsylvania. Sestak raised $442,000 in the three-month period, down from his previous quarter, which Specter's campaign said proved Democratic donors had rejected his candidacy. Specter's fundraising advantage was significant because it allowed him to start early in running political campaign commercials.

Starting in April, both Specter and Sestak launched television advertisements that were particularly critical of each other. Sestak, who had been saving most of his roughly $5 million campaign funds until the final month of the primary race, unveiled a 60-second spot that highlighted his Navy career and described the role his daughter's experience as a brain cancer survivor played in his decision to enter politics. The commercial did not discuss Specter by name but made several implicit references to him, such as Sestak's statements that "too many politicians are concerned about keeping their jobs instead of helping people" and "if we want real change in Washington, we can't keep sending the same career politicians to represent us". Specter launched several commercials, most focusing on his plans to promote job growth. One advertisement, however, focused entirely on attacking Sestak, highlighting not only his voting attendance record – labeling him "No Show Joe" – but also his Navy service. The commercial stated Sestak was "relieved of duty in the Navy for creating a poor command climate", a reference to Sestak's 2005 transfer from a senior Pentagon planning post to a lesser position, which effectively ended his naval career.

The "<a href="Navy%20Times">Navy Times</a>" had previously reported the transfer resulted from Sestak forcing subordinates to work unreasonable hours, although Sestak himself disputed that accusation and attributed the transfer to the fact that the new top officer, Admiral <a href="Michael%20Mullen">Michael Mullen</a>, simply wanted to appoint his own team. Sestak called on Specter to stop broadcasting the commercial, accusing the Senator of "Republican-style" negative campaign tactics, which he compared to those used against Senator <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a> by the <a href="Swift%20Vets%20and%20POWs%20for%20Truth">Swift Vets and POWs for Truth</a> during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 presidential election</a>. Sestak said in a statement, "It's time to tell Arlen Specter: Democrats don't '<a href="Swiftboating">swift boat</a>'. We're better than that." A group of veterans gathered in Philadelphia to echo Sestak's call that the commercial should be removed, with retired <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> Lieutenant General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Kelley">Robert E. Kelley</a> announcing, "We're all here because we're enraged at the fact that someone, anyone, in the United States today would question someone who has 30 years of service." Specter's campaign replied they would not remove the commercial because it was accurate, and instead called on Sestak to remove his own advertisement, claiming it violated <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> guidelines because it used military images, references and jargon without a disclaimer that it was not endorsed by the department.

Sestak and Specter held their first and only televised debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes and said that the rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, "Nobody has ever called me a liar," and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of <a href="Karl%20Rove">Karl Rove</a>, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, "It goes to his ability to get things done, to get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s. "The Philadelphia Inquirer" noted the debate was "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".
With only two weeks remaining before the primary, a Quinnipiac University poll released May 4 showed Specter's lead against Sestak had significantly narrowed, dropping from 53-32 percent in the previous month to 47-39 percent. A daily tracking poll by Muhlenberg College showed the race as even closer, with Specter supported by 46 percent of likely voters surveyed, and Sestak trailing only four points at 42 percent. The Quinnipiac poll indicated the strongest factor in these changes was that Sestak was gaining better name recognition due to his television commercials. According to the poll, 43 percent of respondents now had a favorable view of him, compared to only 33 percent in March. The day after the poll was released, Sestak unveiled a new television advertisement strongly critical of Specter, highlighting the incumbent Senator's Republican history and showing images of him with George W. Bush and Republican vice presidential candidate <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a>. The commercial featured a clip of Specter saying, "My change in party will enable me to be reelected" and ended with a narrator saying, "Arlen Specter switched parties to save one job: his, not yours." The same week the advertisement ran, T.J. Rooney said in an interview with "<a href="Politico%20%28newspaper%29">Politico</a>" that a Sestak primary victory would be "cataclysmic" for the party in the general election, and warned Democratic voters, "If we want to keep this seat in Democratic hands, the only person capable of delivering that victory is Arlen Specter."

Specter received several high-profile endorsements during the final weeks leading up to the primary. Senator John Kerry, who had been an early supporter of Sestak's <a href="Pennsylvania%207th%20congressional%20district%20election%2C%202006">2006 House campaign</a>, endorsed Specter in the Senate race, calling him "fighter and a friend, and I am proud to vouch for his character". "The Philadelphia Inquirer" called Sestak "a worthy opponent" and said that his determination made the race especially competitive, but ultimately embraced Specter, whose overall career record the newspaper said was "a good choice for Democrats". The "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>" also endorsed Specter, focusing more on the fact that Specter stood the best chance of defeating Toomey in a general election challenge. The "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Tribune-Review">Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a>", however, endorsed Sestak, calling him "incredibly intelligent, thoughtful and articular" while condemning Specter as a "self-serving political ferret" for switching parties. Actor <a href="Michael%20J.%20Fox">Michael J. Fox</a>, who suffers from <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, appeared in a television advertisement for Specter, praising the Senator for his long-standing support of stem cell research. Fox said, "In the fight against disease, you can look back or move forward. Arlen Specter is moving forward." President Obama sent e-mail messages to his <a href="Organizing%20for%20America">Organizing for America</a> supporters encouraging them to vote for Specter, However, despite his long position of support for Specter, Obama did not fly to Pennsylvania to actively campaign for the Senator during the campaign's final days.

As the campaign entered its final week, polls showed Specter and Sestak at a dead heat, with different surveys reporting contradictory findings over which candidate maintained a slight edge. A Quinnipiac University poll found Specter leading 44-42 percent, with fourteen percent undecided, whereas a Franklin & Marshall poll found Sestak ahead 38-36 percent, with about a quarter of voters undecided. In both cases, the lead fell within the survey's margin of error. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall poll, said that Sestak improved because his television commercials were resonating with voters on three fronts: the arguments that Specter switched parties for solely political reasons, that he consistently voted for Republican policies and that he had been in office too long.

Sestak won the May 18 primary with 53.8 percent of the vote, or 568,563 of the votes cast, compared to 46.2 percent and 487,217 votes for Specter. The defeat led to the end of Specter's nearly 30-year Senate career, the longest of any Pennsylvania Senator in history. Afterward, Sestak declared, "This is what democracy should look like: a win for the people over the establishment. It should come as no surprise to anyone that people want a change." Specter conceded defeat and said, "It's been a great privilege to serve the people of Pennsylvania. It's been a great privilege to be in the United States Senate." Commentators suggested Specter's defeat signaled an electorate unsatisfied with the establishment in both major parties, and indicated that the backing of prominent politicians had little effect on voters during this political age. Sestak's victory was seen as a minor embarrassment for Obama, who strongly and publicly advocated for Specter during the race. Several news outlets reflected that Sestak's television advertisements condemning Specter as a hypocrite and opportunist were especially effective and may have been the primary factor in his victory. "The Washington Post" said the Pennsylvania race drew more attention than any other primary election in 2010 due to Specter's longevity and his switch to the Democratic party.

Toomey went on to defeat Sestak in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Pennsylvania%2C%202010">general election</a>, winning by a margin of 51 to 49 percent.

During a February 2010 television interview, Sestak said that in July 2009 he was offered a job in President Obama's administration if he dropped out of the race. During a February 18 taping of "Larry Kane: Voice of Reason", a Philadelphia-area local news show, host <a href="Larry%20Kane">Larry Kane</a> asked Sestak whether such an offer had been made, to which Sestak responded, "Yes", without elaborating beyond that it was a high-ranking assignment and that he did not plan to take it. In subsequent press inquiries, Sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement. When asked about the matter by "The Washington Post", he said, "There has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer things if I got out." Likewise, during an appearance on the Fox News Channel, he said, "I was asked a direct question yesterday and I answered it honestly. There's nothing more to go into. I'm in this race now." Over the next month, White House officials did not answer multiple press inquiries about whether Sestak's claims were true. On March 16, <a href="White%20House%20Press%20Secretary">White House Press Secretary</a> <a href="Robert%20Gibbs">Robert Gibbs</a> said he had reviewed the matter and found conversations that had been held with Sestak were "not problematic."

In March, Congressman <a href="Darrell%20Issa">Darrell Issa</a>, the ranking Republican on the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Oversight%20and%20Government%20Reform">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a>, sent a letter to <a href="White%20House%20Counsel">White House Counsel</a> <a href="Robert%20Bauer">Robert Bauer</a> stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama administration may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> wrote to <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Eric%20Holder">Eric Holder</a> seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">White House Chief of Staff</a> <a href="Rahm%20Emanuel">Rahm Emanuel</a> enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.

Bauer said that nobody in the administration itself directly discussed the offer with Sestak, and he does not believe there was anything improper, illegal or unethical about the conduct. Republicans in Congress disagreed, arguing the action contradicted claims Obama made during his <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">presidential campaign</a> about ethical conduct and transparency in government. Darrell Issa, in particular, felt it was an <a href="Impeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States">impeachable</a> offense and referred to it as "Obama's <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate</a>". Nevertheless, the matter gradually became less of a focus during the primary election, where other topics like spending and the economy took the spotlight. With Issa poised to become chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform following the Republican Party recapturing the house during the <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%202010">2010 midterm elections</a>, it was widely expected he would launch an official investigation into the job offer based on his prior critical comments about the matter. However, on November 5, Issa announced he would not pursue an investigation. Some politicians and members of the media said that the job offer made to Sestak was neither illegal nor abhorrent, and that such deals are regularly made by politicians of all levels. <a href="Chris%20Cillizza">Chris Cillizza</a> of "The Washington Post" felt the matter only appeared to be a scandal because the White House badly mishandled the response, and "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" writer John Kass wrote, "Offering a spot to an ambitious young politician to protect an old servile weakling isn't new. Presidents do it, governors do it. Big-city mayors really know how to do it."

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a condition featuring attacks of <a href="paralysis">muscle weakness</a> in the presence of <a href="hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</a> (overactivity of the <a href="thyroid">thyroid</a> gland). <a href="Hypokalemia">Hypokalemia</a> (a decreased <a href="potassium">potassium</a> level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the <a href="muscles%20of%20respiration">breathing muscles</a> leads to <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a>, or if the low potassium levels lead to <a href="cardiac%20arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmia</a>s (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.

The condition has been linked with <a href="genetic%20mutation">genetic mutation</a>s in genes that code for certain <a href="ion%20channel">ion channel</a>s that transport <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>s (<a href="sodium">sodium</a> and <a href="potassium">potassium</a>) across <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s. The main ones are the <a href="Cav1.1">L-type calcium channel α1-subunit</a> and <a href="Kir2.6">potassium inward rectifier 2.6</a>; it is therefore classified as a <a href="channelopathy">channelopathy</a>. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a>, under conditions of high <a href="thyroxine">thyroxine</a> (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.

Treatment of the hypokalemia, followed by correction of the hyperthyroidism, leads to complete resolution of the attacks. It occurs predominantly in males of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent. TPP is one of several conditions that can cause <a href="periodic%20paralysis">periodic paralysis</a>.

An attack often begins with muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is followed by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or the early hours of the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the <a href="corticobulbar%20tract">mouth and throat</a>, <a href="Muscles%20of%20orbit">eyes</a>, and <a href="muscles%20of%20respiration">breathing</a> are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a>. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On <a href="neurological%20examination">neurological examination</a> during an attack, <a href="flaccid%20paralysis">flaccid weakness</a> of the limbs is noted; <a href="stretch%20reflex">reflexes</a> are usually diminished, but the <a href="sensory%20system">sensory system</a> is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.

Attacks may be brought on by <a href="physical%20exercise">physical exertion</a>, drinking <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a>, or eating food high in <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s or <a href="salt">salt</a>. This may explain why attacks are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur during a period of rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.

There may be symptoms of thyroid overactivity, such as <a href="weight%20loss%23Unintentional%20weight%20loss">weight loss</a>, <a href="tachycardia">a fast heart rate</a>, <a href="tremor">tremor</a>, and <a href="perspiration">perspiration</a>; but such symptoms occur in only half of all cases. The most common type of hyperthyroidism, <a href="Graves%27%20disease">Graves' disease</a>, may additionally cause eye problems (<a href="Graves%27%20ophthalmopathy">Graves' ophthalmopathy</a>) and skin changes of the legs (<a href="pretibial%20myxedema">pretibial myxedema</a>). Thyroid disease may also cause muscle weakness in the form of <a href="thyrotoxic%20myopathy">thyrotoxic myopathy</a>, but this is constant rather than episodic.

Genetic mutations in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Ca1.1) have been described in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in a different part of the gene from those described in the related condition <a href="familial%20periodic%20paralysis">familial periodic paralysis</a>. In TPP, the mutations described are <a href="single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">single-nucleotide polymorphism</a>s located in the <a href="hormone%20response%20element">hormone response element</a> responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that <a href="Transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for <a href="KCNC4">potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4</a> (K3.4) and <a href="Nav1.4">sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha</a> (Na1.4).

Of people with TPP, 33% from various populations were demonstrated to have mutations in "KCNJ18", the gene coding for K2.6, an <a href="inward-rectifier%20potassium%20ion%20channel">inward-rectifier potassium ion channel</a>. This gene, too, harbors a thyroid response element.

Certain forms of <a href="human%20leukocyte%20antigen">human leukocyte antigen</a> (HLA)—especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17, and DRW8—are more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays a central role in the <a href="immune%20system">immune response</a>, might imply an immune system cause, but it is uncertain whether this directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>.

The most common underlying form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome due to an <a href="Autoimmunity">autoimmune reaction</a> that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as <a href="thyroiditis">thyroiditis</a>, <a href="toxic%20nodular%20goitre">toxic nodular goiter</a>, <a href="thyroid%20adenoma">toxic adenoma</a>, <a href="thyroid-stimulating%20hormone">TSH</a>-producing <a href="pituitary%20adenoma">pituitary adenoma</a>, excessive ingestion of <a href="thyroxine">thyroxine</a> or <a href="iodine">iodine</a>, and <a href="amiodarone">amiodarone</a>-induced hyperthyroidism.

The muscle weakness and increased risk of irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased <a href="Na%2B/K%2B-ATPase">Na/K-ATPase</a> activity (the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> that moves potassium into cells and keeps <a href="sodium">sodium</a> in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the <a href="acid-base%20homeostasis">acid-base balance</a> is usually disturbed, with <a href="metabolic%20alkalosis">metabolic alkalosis</a> and <a href="metabolic%20acidosis">metabolic acidosis</a> often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to <a href="Hyperpolarization%20%28biology%29">hyperpolarization</a> of <a href="skeletal%20muscle">muscle cells</a>, making the <a href="neuromuscular%20junction">neuromuscular junction</a> less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.

It is not clear how the described genetic defects increase the Na/K-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of <a href="catecholamine">catecholamine</a>s (such as <a href="adrenaline">adrenaline</a>) in the blood, increasing Na/K-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased <a href="insulin">insulin</a> levels; this is known to activate Na/K-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that <a href="androgen">male hormones</a> increase Na/K-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.

TPP is regarded as a model for related conditions, known as "channelopathies", which have been linked with mutations in ion channels; the majority of these conditions occurs episodically.

<a href="Hypokalemia">Hypokalemia</a> (low blood <a href="potassium">potassium</a> levels) commonly occurs during attacks; levels below 3.0 mmol/l are typically encountered. <a href="Magnesium">Magnesium</a> and <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> levels are often found to be decreased. <a href="Creatine%20kinase">Creatine kinase</a> levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of <a href="rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</a> (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. <a href="Electrocardiography">Electrocardiography</a> (ECG/EKG) may show <a href="tachycardia">tachycardia</a> (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (<a href="atrial%20fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</a>, <a href="ventricular%20tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</a>), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). <a href="Electromyography">Electromyography</a> shows changes similar to those encountered in <a href="myopathy">myopathies</a> (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the <a href="compound%20muscle%20action%20potential">compound muscle action potential</a>s (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.

TPP is distinguished from other forms of periodic paralysis (especially <a href="hypokalemic%20periodic%20paralysis">hypokalemic periodic paralysis</a>) with <a href="thyroid%20function%20test">thyroid function test</a>s on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in <a href="thyrotoxicosis">thyrotoxicosis</a> the levels of <a href="thyroxine">thyroxine</a> and <a href="triiodothyronine">triiodothyronine</a> are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the <a href="pituitary%20gland">pituitary gland</a>. Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of <a href="hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</a>.

In the acute phase of an attack, administration of <a href="potassium">potassium</a> will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications. However, caution is advised as the total amount of potassium in the body is not decreased, and it is possible for potassium levels to overshoot ("rebound <a href="hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</a>"); slow infusions of potassium chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.

The effects of excess thyroid hormone typically respond to the administration of a non-selective <a href="beta%20blocker">beta blocker</a>, such as <a href="propranolol">propranolol</a> (as most of the symptoms are driven by increased levels of adrenaline and its effect on the <a href="Adrenergic%20receptor%23%CE%B2%20receptors">β-adrenergic receptors</a>). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated.

Treatment of the thyroid disease usually leads to resolution of the paralytic attacks. Depending on the nature of the disease, the treatment may consist of <a href="Hyperthyroidism%23Thyrostatics%20.28antithyroid%20drugs.29">thyrostatics</a> (drugs that reduce production of thyroid hormone), <a href="radioiodine">radioiodine</a>, or occasionally thyroid surgery.

TPP occurs predominantly in <a href="male">male</a>s of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent, as well as <a href="Thailand">Thais</a>, with much lower rates in people of other ethnicities. In Chinese and Japanese people with hyperthyroidism, 1.8–1.9% experience TPP. This is in contrast to North America, where studies report a rate of 0.1–0.2%. <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, who share a genetic background with East Asians, are at an increased risk.

The typical age of onset is 20–40. It is unknown why males are predominantly affected, with rates in males being 17- to 70-fold those in females, despite thyroid overactivity being much more common in women.

After several case reports in the 18th and 19th centuries, periodic paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Otto%20Westphal">Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal</a> (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from <a href="Fukuoka">Fukuoka</a>, observed the high rate of thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a>; they described the condition in a patient with features of <a href="Graves%27%20disease">Graves' disease</a>. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon has been used as a diagnostic test.

In 1974 it was discovered that <a href="propranolol">propranolol</a> could prevent attacks. The concept of channelopathies and the link with specific ion channel mutations emerged at the end of the 20th century.

Warlugulong

Warlugulong (1977) is an <a href="acrylic%20paint">acrylic</a> on canvas painting by <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous Australian</a> artist <a href="Clifford%20Possum%20Tjapaltjarri">Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri</a>. Owned for many years by the <a href="Commonwealth%20Bank%20of%20Australia">Commonwealth Bank of Australia</a>, the work was sold by art dealer Hank Ebes on 24 July 2007, setting a record price for a <a href="contemporary%20Indigenous%20Australian%20art">contemporary Indigenous Australian art</a> work bought at auction when it was purchased by the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> for A$2.4 million. The painting illustrates the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata, together with eight other <a href="Dreaming%20%28Australian%20Aboriginal%20art%29">dreamings</a> associated with localities about which Clifford Possum had <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20sacred%20sites">traditional knowledge</a>. It exemplifies a distinctive painting style developed by <a href="Papunya%20Tula">Papunya Tula</a> artists in the 1970s, and blends representation of landscape with ceremonial <a href="iconography">iconography</a>. Art critic <a href="Benjamin%20Genocchio">Benjamin Genocchio</a> describes it as "a work of real national significance [and] one of the most important 20th-century Australian paintings".

<a href="Contemporary%20Indigenous%20Australian%20art">Contemporary Indigenous Australian art</a> originated with the <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous</a> men of <a href="Papunya">Papunya</a>, located around northwest of <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a> in Australia's <a href="Western%20Desert%20cultural%20bloc">Western Desert</a>, who began painting in 1971. The youngest was <a href="Clifford%20Possum%20Tjapaltjarri">Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri</a>, encouraged by his older brother <a href="Tim%20Leura%20Tjapaltjarri">Tim Leura Tjapaltjarri</a>. A number of the men developed a distinctive style of narrative painting that, beginning around 1976, resulted in the production of several "monumental" works that included representations of both their <a href="Indigenous%20land%20rights">traditional lands</a> and of ceremonial <a href="iconography">iconography</a>. Clifford Possum was the first to make this transition commencing with a related painting, also titled "Warlugulong" (1976), now held by the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a>. The two images are amongst five that the artist created between 1976 and 1979 that linked the iconography of <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20mythology">sacred stories</a> to geographic representation of his country – the land to which he belonged and about which he had traditional knowledge. The artist's images of this period are visually complex, and contain a wide variety of patterns, unified by strong background motifs and structure.

Created in <a href="acrylic%20paint">synthetic polymer paint</a> on canvas, and a substantial in size, the work's title is taken from a location roughly "northwest of <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a> associated with a powerful desert dreaming". Clifford Possum would often collaborate with other artists, particularly his brother Tim Leura, and the brothers together created the 1976 work of the same name. Art critic <a href="Benjamin%20Genocchio">Benjamin Genocchio</a> has referred to the 1977 work as also being by the brothers; however, the National Gallery of Australia credits it solely to Clifford Possum. Like the other four works of the period that are symbolic maps of the artist's country, the painting is accompanied by annotated diagrams of the images and notes that explain the <a href="Dreaming%20%28Australian%20Aboriginal%20art%29">dreamings</a> that they include.
While the painting has been described as showing the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata starting the first <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>, it portrays elements of nine distinct dreamings, of which Lungkata's tale is the central motif. Lungkata was the <a href="Bluetongue%20Lizard">Bluetongue Lizard</a> Man, an ancestral figure responsible for creating bushfire. The painting portrays the results of a fire, caused by Lungkata to punish his two sons who did not share with their father the <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a> they had caught. The sons' skeletons are on the right hand side of the image, shown against a background representing smoke and ashes.

Around this central motif are arranged elements of eight other stories, all of them represented at least in part by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of <a href="emu">emu</a>s from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the <a href="rock%20wallaby">rock wallaby</a>, or Mala, men journeying north from <a href="Port%20Augusta">Port Augusta</a> in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of <a href="dingo">dingo</a>es going to a place called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.

This work excludes elements of several dreamings associated with country further south, which had been included in the painting created by Clifford Possum and his brother a year earlier. The omission led scholar <a href="Vivien%20Johnson">Vivien Johnson</a> to conclude that "Warlugulong" (1977) portrays a narrower geographic area than the preceding work. The artist also modified some of the iconography, and limited the explanations of the painting, omitting secret-sacred dimensions of the stories to avoid offending other Indigenous men, and in recognition that most of the audience for the work would be uninitiated non-Indigenous people.

Johnson's analysis of the painting emphasises the relationship between the representation of geographical sites in the <a href="Yuendumu">Yuendumu</a> region and the dreaming stories associated with those sites. She concludes that there is "a topographic rationale for the order in which the Dreamings appear from left to right (that is, east to west) across the painting [as well as for] the transverse Dreaming trails". However, beyond this general principle, she argues that the layout of symbols and images is influenced by the desire to present a symmetrical work. There is greater visual symmetry in this painting than in its 1976 predecessor; symmetry is a strong influence in the works of many of the early Western Desert artists, including Clifford Possum, <a href="Billy%20Stockman%20Tjapaltjarri">Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri</a> and <a href="Kaapa%20Tjampitjinpa">Kaapa Tjampitjinpa</a>.

"Warlugulong" (1977) is acclaimed as a landmark Indigenous painting; a great work by one of the country's foremost artists. Described as "epic" and "sprawling", Genocchio said of it that is "a work of real national significance [and] one of the most important 20th-century Australian paintings". The authors of the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>'s book, "Collection Highlights", characterises the painting as the artist's most significant. Artist and curator <a href="Brenda%20L%20Croft">Brenda L Croft</a> agreed, considering it "an epic painting, encyclopaedic in both content and ambition" and "the artist's most significant work". The work and the price it achieved at auction in 2007 are cited as evidence of both the importance of Clifford Possum as an artist, and of the maturation and growth of the Australian Indigenous art market.

"Warlugulong" was first exhibited at a show in Alice Springs, where it attracted crowds of interested viewers, but failed to sell. Realities Gallery in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> then included the work in a major exhibition of Papunya Tula artworks. It was purchased for A$1,200 by the Commonwealth Bank, which hung it in a bank training centre cafeteria on the <a href="Mornington%20Peninsula">Mornington Peninsula</a>. The bank sold it by auction in 1996. The auction house trading the work expected it to fetch around $5,000 and did not make a feature of it in the catalogue, but dealers including Hank Ebes, the successful bidder, recognised the painting's significance and it sold for $36,000 plus commission. After hanging in Ebes's living room for eleven years, it was auctioned in Melbourne by <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> on 24 July 2007. It sold for $2.4 million, thoroughly eclipsing the previous record for an Indigenous Australian painting, set when <a href="Emily%20Kngwarreye">Emily Kngwarreye</a>'s "<a href="Earth%27s%20Creation">Earth's Creation</a>" was bought in May of the same year for just over $1 million. "Warlugulong"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s buyer was the National Gallery of Australia, which purchased the work as part of its 25th Anniversary Gifts Program. The Gallery considers the painting to be possibly the most important in its collection of Indigenous Australian art. As of 2016, the work is on display in the National Gallery.

When the Australian government in 2009 introduced a <a href="droit%20de%20suite%23Australia">resale royalty</a> scheme, the sale history of "Warlugulong" was frequently used to argue in favour of the scheme, designed to ensure that artists and their families continued to benefit from the appreciating value of old works.

Hadji Ali

Hadji Ali (c. 1887–92 – November 5, 1937) was a <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> performance artist, thought to be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled <a href="regurgitation%20%28digestion%29">regurgitation</a>. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a>, and then acting by turns as a human <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a> and <a href="fire%20extinguisher">fire extinguisher</a> as he expelled the two liquids onto a <a href="Theatrical%20property">theatrical prop</a>. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed.

Although he never gained wide fame, Ali had a dedicated following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for heads of state including Tsar <a href="Nicholas%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a>. <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a> named him her favorite vaudevillian and <a href="David%20Blaine">David Blaine</a> identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the <a href="short%20film">short film</a> "Strange as It Seems" (1930) and in "Politiquerias" (1931), the Spanish-language version of <a href="Laurel%20and%20Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>'s "<a href="Chickens%20Come%20Home">Chickens Come Home</a>". Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from "Politiquerias": 1977's "Gizmo!", and 1999's "Vaudeville". Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the <a href="Rockefeller%20University">Rockefeller Institute</a> had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> for study, though the offer was declined.

Hadji Ali was born into a working-class family in approximately 1887 or 1892, depending on the source consulted, probably in <a href="Khedivate%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a>. His fame was as a practitioner of a recognized vaudeville subgenre known as a "<a href="regurgitation%20act">regurgitation act</a>", involving the swallowing of material or objects and their regurgitation in various ways. Ali became aware as a child that he possessed an unusual gastric ability. He explained in response to audience questions at a performance held at <a href="Mount%20Saint%20Mary%27s%20Hospital">St. Mary's Hospital</a> in <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>, New York, in May 1926, that while swimming in the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> as a ten-year-old boy, he naturally discovered that he could swallow a large amount of water and blow it out like a <a href="Whale%23Blowhole%28s%29">whale spouting</a>. He continued to develop and refine the ability as he grew older. A more dramatic version of these events was provided by Ali's daughter, Almina Ali, in an interview in England after his death. She stated that his abilities were first learned through a single incident: while bathing in the Nile, he inadvertently swallowed a fish and an ample volume of water. Instead of dying, as those present thought he might, Ali simply regurgitated the liquid and the fish without ill effect.

Ali learned that his regurgitation talents had the potential to entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:

I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain from one side of the road to the other ... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. 

Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar <a href="Nicholas%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a> to perform at the <a href="Winter%20Palace">Winter Palace</a> in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." Following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.
Ali came to the United States with Almina in the mid-1920s. They performed together at fairs, carnivals and in vaudeville, sometimes advertised under the collective name, "Hadji Ali & Co." Almina played the part of assistant in her father's act, billed in his shows as "The Princess". Ali alone had a variety of stage names, including: "The Great Egyptian Miracle Man", "The Amazing Regurgitator", "The Egyptian Enigma", "The Human Aquarium", "The Human Volcano" and "The 9th Wonder of the Scientific World". Ali has been described as a "large, barrel-chested and bearded man ... [that cut] an imposing figure in his Arab costume."

Although Ali spoke a number of languages and became a <a href="Naturalization">naturalized</a> U.S. citizen, it was reported that Almina acted as his interpreter in the United States and other places, as he did not speak English and was illiterate. Once he had gained some notoriety, Ali took on as his manager <a href="Hubert%20Julian">Hubert Julian</a>, a former colonel in the <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Abyssinian</a> Air Force. Although he developed a significant following, even being named <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a>'s favorite vaudevillian, Ali "remained more a sideshow curiosity than a true vaudeville headliner" according to at least one source. Nevertheless, at the time of his death in 1937, Julian commented that Ali had "earned big money in America—$1,000 a week sometimes. I was building him up here [in Europe] and had a Continental tour arranged."

The mainstay of Ali's act was "water spouting". After swallowing large amounts of water, 60 to 100 glasses at a time, he spouted the water in a continuous stream for a sustained period of time, sometimes approaching one minute.
Another common trick was to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled <a href="hazelnut">hazelnut</a>s (although one of his posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali then brought them up one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience. In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six <a href="handkerchief">handkerchief</a>s of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members.

In a 1929 article appearing in the "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28Lowell%29">Lowell Sun</a>" newspaper, physician <a href="Morris%20Fishbein">Morris Fishbein</a> speculated that for Ali's nut feat, the one nut of a different variety was held in the mouth rather than swallowed, thus allowing him to produce it on cue. Dr. Fishbein also stated that unnamed "investigators" were convinced that for Ali's handkerchief stunt, to produce them in the sequence stipulated by the audience Ali flavored the cloth, and could therefore taste for the correct one as he brought them up. Ali also swallowed live goldfish, watches, coins, <a href="costume%20jewelry">costume jewelry</a>, paper money, peach pits, stones, live mice, buttons, <a href="Billiard%20ball">pool balls</a> and other odd objects. In another standard performance segment, he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of inhaling, he swallowed the smoke and, after a significant time had passed, issued it forth in a steady stream like an erupting volcano.
Ali's longstanding finale was the swallowing of copious amounts of water again, but this time followed by a pint of <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a>. A <a href="Theatrical%20property">prop</a> was then produced, typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table, within which a small flame burned. Lighter than water and <a href="Miscibility">immiscible</a> with it, the kerosene floated above the liquid in Ali's gut, allowing him to disgorge it first. The stage thus set, and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells, Ali became a "human <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a>", spewing the <a href="accelerant">accelerant</a> in a long stream over the sacrificial prop, setting it ablaze. Once the kerosene was exhausted, the water followed, streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away, extinguishing the fire.
At some performances, a panel or "jury" from the audience was invited on stage to verify that no <a href="Magic%20%28illusion%29">trick</a> mechanism was being employed—that he was actually swallowing the items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation. Sometimes Ali would stroll into the audience during his nut swallowing trick. His stomach exposed by his standard costume, he invited audience members to pat his stomach, allowing them to hear the nuts rattling within. One newspaper reported that Ali's feats, essentially controlled vomiting, were performed in "a manner without the least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness." Not everyone felt the same: at least one of Ali's engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act "was killing their supper shows". Famed <a href="Escapology">escapologist</a> and magician <a href="Harry%20Houdini">Harry Houdini</a> remarked in his 1920 work "Miracle Mongers and Their Methods" that water spouting was a "performance that could not fail to disgust a modern audience."

The abilities of Ali fascinated the public and medical authorities. As reported in a 1928 "<a href="The%20Sheboygan%20Press">Sheboygan Press</a>" article, at one of Ali's acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during the performance. They came away satisfied that he was actually imbibing and regurgitating the material and objects as claimed, but remained "mystified over his extraordinary performance." According to an article appearing in the "Naugatuck Daily News", "Physicians of three continents have puzzled over the gastronomical mechanism of this human ostrich without success. X-ray experiments have been made during his exhibition without a plausible explanation forthcoming that satisfies the critical, in fact, the profession of surgery has thrown up its hands in amazement over this human ostrich."

Ali's act was captured in two films: the 1930 <a href="Short%20film">short</a> "Strange as It Seems", and "Politiquerias" (1931), the expanded Spanish-language version of <a href="Laurel%20and%20Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>'s "<a href="Chickens%20Come%20Home">Chickens Come Home</a>". Ali also had a <a href="bit%20part">bit part</a> as the "Turkish landlord" in Warner Bros.' 1932 film "<a href="Scarlet%20Dawn">Scarlet Dawn</a>" starring <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks%2C%20Jr.">Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.</a> and <a href="Nancy%20Carroll">Nancy Carroll</a>. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from "Politiquerias": 1977's "Gizmo!", and 1999's "Vaudeville", a documentary produced by <a href="KCTS-TV">KCTS-TV</a> that exhibits 90 vaudeville acts over a two-hour running time. The documentary has since aired on the <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">Public Broadcasting Service</a>'s "American Masters" series numerous times.

Speaking about the democratic nature of the vaudeville performance circuit, "Vaudeville's" writer and executive producer said in reference to Ali that the film "embraced everything from Caruso to a guy who threw up." By contrast, in episode 30 of the <a href="Sundance%20Channel%20%28United%20States%29">Sundance Channel</a> television program "<a href="Iconoclasts%20%28TV%20series%29">Iconoclasts</a>", magician <a href="David%20Blaine">David Blaine</a> speaks enthusiastically of Ali. During the episode, Blaine shows artist <a href="Chuck%20Close">Chuck Close</a> Ali's kerosene and water finale footage from "Politiquerias" and comments that Ali is his "favorite magician ... it's real but nobody's been able to do it since ... his name was Hadji Ali ... he's my favorite of all time."

Ali died on November 5, 1937, in <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>, England, from <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a> during a bout of <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>. Even before his death, a rumor had circulated that the <a href="Rockefeller%20University">Rockefeller Institute</a> sought to procure Ali's stomach upon his death, and would pay as much as $50,000 for it. This claim appeared in a poster advertising Ali's impending appearance at a theater during his lifetime. After Ali's death was reported, the rumor resurfaced as an active offer of $10,000. When a Rockefeller Institute manager was interviewed about the story, he said the offer had never been made but that nevertheless, "we should very much like to see the body." Almina and Julian transported Ali's body back to the United States on board the "<a href="RMS%20Queen%20Mary">Queen Mary</a>". According to a November 29, 1937 article in the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>", upon their arrival, Almina offered her father's body to <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>'s <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> for investigation by surgeons, after which it would be transported to Egypt for interment in a mausoleum. However, "The Afro-American" newspaper reported on December 11, 1937, that Johns Hopkins' officials had declined the offer.

Pioneer Helmet

The Pioneer Helmet (also known as the Wollaston Helmet or Northamptonshire Helmet) is a boar-crested <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> helmet from the late seventh century found in <a href="Wollaston%2C%20Northamptonshire">Wollaston, Northamptonshire</a>, United Kingdom. It was discovered during a March 1997 excavation before the land was to be mined for gravel and was part of the grave of a young man. Other objects in the grave, such as a <a href="hanging%20bowl">hanging bowl</a> and a <a href="Pattern%20welding">pattern welded</a> sword, suggest that it was the <a href="tumulus">burial mound</a> of a high-status warrior.

The sparsely decorated nature of the helmet, a utilitarian iron fighting piece, belies its rarity. It is one of just six Anglo-Saxon helmets yet discovered, joined by finds from <a href="Benty%20Grange%20helmet">Benty Grange</a>, <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>, <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">York</a>, <a href="Shorwell%20helmet">Shorwell</a> and <a href="Staffordshire%20helmet">Staffordshire</a>; its basic form is nearly identical to that of the richer Coppergate helmet found in York. Like these, the Pioneer Helmet is an example of the "crested helmets" that flourished in England and Scandinavia from the sixth through eleventh centuries.

The distinctive feature of the helmet is the boar mounted atop its crest. Boar-crested helmets are a staple of Anglo-Saxon imagery, evidence of a <a href="Germanic%20mythology">Germanic tradition</a> in which the boar invoked the protection of the gods. The Pioneer Helmet is one of three—together with the Benty Grange helmet and the detached <a href="Guilden%20Morden%20boar">Guilden Morden boar</a>—known to have survived. These boar crests recall a time when such decoration may have been common; the Anglo-Saxon poem "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", in which boar-adorned helmets are mentioned five times, speaks of a funeral <a href="pyre">pyre</a> "heaped with boar-shaped helmets forged in gold," forging a link between the warrior hero of legend and the Pioneer Helmet of reality.

The helmet was named after Pioneer Aggregates UK Ltd, who funded its excavation and conservation. It was unveiled at the <a href="New%20Walk%20Museum">New Walk Museum</a> in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, and is on display at the <a href="Royal%20Armouries%20Museum">Royal Armouries Museum</a> in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>.

The <a href="helmet">helmet</a> has the same basic form as the Anglo-Saxon <a href="Coppergate%20helmet">Coppergate helmet</a>, but is a utilitarian piece with little decoration, and is larger, perhaps to allow for additional padding. It originally consisted of an iron skull cap, from which hung two cheek guards. The form of neck protection that the helmet afforded, if any, is uncertain, owing to ploughing damage to the helmet.

The cap of the helmet was constructed from twelve individual components riveted together. The basic form was created by four pieces: a brow band joined by a nose-to-nape band, and, on either side, a lateral band reaching from the side of the brow band to the top of the nose-to-nape band. Cutouts at the front of the brow and nose-to-nape bands functioned as eye-holes, and a wide strip of metal was riveted along the edge of the openings, perhaps to provide balance or decoration. Four subtriangular infill plates were riveted inside to cover the resulting holes. Finally, three narrow C-sectioned strips were added to provide additional strength, one each running the length of the nose-to-nape and lateral bands. The <a href="nasal%20helmet">nasal</a> is not a separate component, but rather is a continuation of the nose-to-nape bands.

Atop the helmet was set the boar. It was affixed to the C-sectioned nose-to-nape strip, and was forged from a single rod of iron. Its back was bent downwards to form the hind legs, while the front of the rod was split, one part bent to form the forelegs, the other part continuing forward to form the boar's snout. Beyond very minor details—the snout was made to be slightly triangular, the hind was somewhat flattened, and slight grooves in the forelegs suggested individual limbs—the boar was not decorated.

Beneath the cap hung two cheek guards. The <a href="dexter%20and%20sinister">sinister</a> cheek guard, which is all that remains other than minor fragments of the <a href="dexter%20and%20sinister">dexter</a>, was long and wide at the top. It was curved inward both laterally and longitudinally other than the upper rear edge which was bent outwards, either intentionally to improve the articulation of the joint, or by damage incurred during use. Two strips of metal were then bent in half, with one folded around the brow band and one around the cheek guard, and attached by a single rivet through each. These encased a narrow loop of wire which held the cheek guards to the cap. A single rivet was also attached to the middle of the guard, probably to facilitate the attachment of leather strips used to draw tight the cheek guards.

The form of neck protection on the helmet, if any, is unclear. The bottom of the back of the helmet is largely missing, although the portion that survives appears to have at least two perforations. These would most likely have been used to attach a neck guard, perhaps like the one made of <a href="aventail">camail</a> on the Coppergate helmet, yet no such remains were found. A series of unexplained iron rods found near the helmet could theoretically have been used as stiffeners for an organic neck guard, such as one made of leather, but such an arrangement has no known parallels; it is instead thought that the rods were more likely belt stiffeners.

The helmet was discovered over <a href="Easter">Easter</a> in March 1997 in <a href="Wollaston%2C%20Northamptonshire">Wollaston</a>, near <a href="Wellingborough">Wellingborough</a>, Northamptonshire. Excavations in the area had taken place for years on behalf of various <a href="construction%20aggregate">aggregate</a> companies before the land was exploited for gravel, and had uncovered an extensive network of <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> and Roman farms. The evidence for post-Roman habitation, however, had been limited to two fragments of a brooch, and two separate collections of pottery, when metal detector surveying discovered a copper alloy <a href="hanging%20bowl">hanging bowl</a> and a <a href="millefiori">millefiori</a>-decorated mount in what turned out to be a grave. The hanging bowl was detected by Steve Critchley, working alongside the archaeologist <a href="Ian%20Meadows%20%28archaeologist%29">Ian Meadows</a>. Meadows immediately recognised the bowl for what it was, and began an excavation.

The grave was in the shape of an elongated oval long and wide, and may have originally been a <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a>. It was only from a main contemporary roadway and was likely intended to have been seen by those passing by. Owing to ensuing years of cultivation and ploughing of the fields, the grave was only deep when excavated. Various artefacts were therefore damaged, and any originally placed higher in the grave, such as a shield or spearheads, may have been completely destroyed. The grave was excavated with brushes and wooden tools, revealing a number of bone fragments, including part of a skull; these were used to suggest that the body was that of a man seventeen to twenty-five years old, laid in a supine position with his head on a pillow and knees slightly raised. Also found were three iron buckles, a small iron knife, a small copper alloy hook, and a series of iron rods of unknown function. A <a href="pattern%20welded">pattern welded</a> sword was also found, and together with the hanging bowl and helmet, marks the grave as one for a person of high social status.

The helmet lay next to where the left hip of the body would have rested. It was on its sinister side, with almost the entirety of the dexter side lost through ploughing. Prior to its deposition the nasal had been bent inwards, fracturing the metal, perhaps in a "ritual killing" of the object; a custom known to many cultures, including Anglo-Saxons and <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a>, the practice involves the deliberate breaking of objects before burial for reasons ranging from the releasing of an object's spirit, to the deterrence of grave robbing. When found it was at first thought to be a bucket. Archaeologists covered it in <a href="Plastic%20wrap">cling film</a>, then wrapped it in <a href="plaster%20of%20Paris">plaster of Paris</a> bandages and raised it in a soil block. This was taken to the conservation laboratory at the <a href="Newarke%20Houses%20Museum">Newarke Houses Museum</a> in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, where it was analysed, and later conserved, by Anthony "Rolly" Read. The plaster-covered soil block was first x-rayed, revealing the boar-crested helmet within.

The remaining half of the helmet was broken into many pieces—between 100 and 200 overall—including some which were deposited within the helmet itself. These fragments were reassembled using the <a href="cellulose%20nitrate">cellulose nitrate</a> adhesive <a href="HMG%20Heat%20and%20Waterproof%20Adhesive">HMG</a>; the surviving cheek guard, alone, was reassembled from eighteen fragments. The helmet was then dried out and taken to the <a href="Leicester%20General%20Hospital">Leicester General Hospital</a>, where it was subjected to digital x-rays and <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a>s. Using this information it was then cleaned, and samples of organic materials—principally textiles and leather, perhaps from the helmet's lining, as well as possible feathers on the brow band—were taken. It was then reassembled into seven larger parts, cleaned again, and finally reconstructed into one piece. Missing sections within the remaining half were then filled in and painted, and in the last step, the boar was affixed to the apex using <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a>. Newspapers as far away as <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> published accounts of the discovery in April, hailing it as "the find of the decade". The helmet was placed on public display on 23 December 1997.

The Wollaston burial was on private land owned by Peter Gammidge and John Minney, and the helmet is now owned by Gammidge and the family of the late Minney. It was termed the "Pioneer Helmet" after Pioneer Aggregates UK Ltd (now owned by <a href="Hanson%20%28company%29">Hanson</a>), who fully funded the conservation, and who had over time spent more than £400,000 funding archaeology in the area. The helmet was displayed until March 1998 at the <a href="New%20Walk%20Museum">New Walk Museum</a> in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, the site of its unveiling. Currently it is on display at the <a href="Royal%20Armouries%20Museum">Royal Armouries Museum</a> in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="West%20Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>.

The Pioneer Helmet is dated to the late seventh century on the basis of the style of belt buckles found in the grave, which were current around 675. This suggests a "<a href="terminus%20post%20quem">terminus post quem</a>" (earliest possible date) for the burial, although not necessarily the helmet's exact date of manufacture or deposition. It is of Anglo-Saxon origin, one of only six such helmets known along with those from <a href="Benty%20Grange%20helmet">Benty Grange</a>, <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>, <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">York</a>, <a href="Shorwell%20helmet">Shorwell</a>, and <a href="Staffordshire%20helmet">Staffordshire</a>. Like these examples—with the exception of the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> Shorwell helmet—the Pioneer Helmet is broadly classed as one of the "crested helmets" known in Northern Europe in the sixth through eleventh centuries AD. These are each characterised by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose-to-nape crest. Except for an outlier fragment found in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, all crested helmets originate from England or Scandinavia, and are distinct from the continental <a href="spangenhelm">spangenhelm</a> and <a href="lamellenhelm">lamellenhelm</a> from the same period.

The <a href="Wild%20boar">boar</a> was an important symbol in prehistoric Europe, where it was "venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time." Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after <a href="La%20T%C3%A8ne">La Tène</a> examples in the fourth century BC, <a href="Gauls">Gaulish</a> specimens three centuries later, and Roman boars in the fourth century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a <a href="mother%20goddess">mother goddess</a> figure among linguistically Celtic communities in <a href="Iron%20Age%20Europe">Iron Age Europe</a>, while the Roman historian <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the <a href="Balts">Baltic</a> <a href="Aesti">Aesti</a> wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium <a href="Gundestrup%20cauldron">Gundestrup cauldron</a>, discovered in Denmark, and on a <a href="Torslunda%20plate">Torslunda plate</a> from Sweden, made some 500 years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols—four <a href="Roman%20legion">legions</a>, including the <a href="Legio%20XX%20Valeria%20Victrix">twentieth</a>, adopted it as their emblem—it was only one among many. The boar nonetheless persisted in continental <a href="Germanic%20mythology">Germanic tradition</a> during the nearly 400 years of <a href="Roman%20rule%20in%20Britain">Roman rule in Britain</a>, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods <a href="Freyja">Freyja</a> and <a href="Freyr">Freyr</a>. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and <a href="Horncastle%20helmet%20fragment">Horncastle</a>, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the "Beowulf" poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them.

The boar-crested Pioneer Helmet recalls the Anglo-Saxon poem "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", in which helmets with boar imagery are referenced five times. In three cases they appear to feature freestanding boars atop the helmets, like the Wollaston example. Such is the case after <a href="Grendel">Grendel</a> is defeated, when a minstrel entertains <a href="Beowulf%20%28hero%29">Beowulf</a> and his men with the story of the <a href="Finnsburh%20Fragment">Fight at Finnsburh</a>, in which <a href="Hn%C3%A6f">Hnæf</a>, king of the Danes, died.

In another case, <a href="Hrothgar">Hrothgar</a> laments the death of <a href="%C3%86schere">Æschere</a>, "my right-hand man when the ranks clashed and our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action" (""). Both instances likely refer to crests such as those on the Benty Grange and Pioneer Helmet, or to the one found in Guilden Morden. These three boars forge a link between the legendary warrior hero of poetry and reality, with each shedding light on the other.

Format of Sesame Street

"<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>" is an American <a href="children%27s%20television%20program">children's television program</a> that is known for its use of format and structure to convey educational concepts to its preschool audience, and to help them prepare for school. It utilizes the conventions of television such as music, humor, sustained action, and a strong visual style, and combines <a href="Jim%20Henson">Jim Henson's</a> <a href="Muppets">Muppets</a>, animation, short films, humor, and cultural references. The show, which premiered in 1969, was the first to base its contents, format, and production values on laboratory and formative research. According to researchers, it was also the first to include a curriculum "detailed or stated in terms of measurable outcomes".

The format of "Sesame Street" consisted of a combination of commercial television production elements and educational techniques. It was the first time a more realistic setting, an inner city street and neighborhood, was used for a children's program. At first, each episode was structured like a <a href="magazine">magazine</a>, but in 1998, as a result of changes in their audience and its viewing habits, the producers researched the reasons for its lower ratings, and changed the show's structure to a more narrative format. The popular, fifteen-minute long segment, "<a href="Elmo%27s%20World">Elmo's World</a>", hosted by the Muppet <a href="Elmo">Elmo</a>, was added in 1998 to make the show more accessible to a younger audience. The producers of "Sesame Street" expanded the new format to the entire show in 2002.

The producers of "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>, "which premiered in 1969", "used elements of commercial television such as music, humor, sustained action, and a strong visual style, in structuring the format of the show. They also used <a href="List%20of%20Sesame%20Street%20recurring%20segments">animation and live-action short films</a>. The show's staff produced segments filmed in-studio with their human and Muppet cast and they contracted out the animations and short films to independent producers. Co-creator <a href="Joan%20Ganz%20Cooney">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> was the first to suggest that they use commercial-like 12–90-second shorts that consistently repeated several key concepts throughout an episode. The studio segments were written to concentrate on the African-American child, a key component of the show's audience.

The show's producers and writers decided to build the new show around a <a href="brownstone">brownstone</a> on an inner-city street, a choice writer Michael Davis called "unprecedented". They reproduced their viewers' neighborhoods—as writer Cary O'Dell described it, "a realistic city street, complete with peeling paint, alleys, front stoops, and metal trash cans along the sidewalk". Director <a href="Jon%20Stone">Jon Stone</a> was convinced that in order for inner-city children to relate to "Sesame Street", the show had to be set in a familiar place. Despite its urban setting, the producers depicted the world in a positive way—both realistically and as it could be. They attempted to present "an idealized world of learning and play", and from a child's perspective. Director Jim Martin called "Sesame Street" "an urban show kids could relate to" and "a reality show with a sprinkling of fantasy".

When "Sesame Street" was developed, most researchers assumed that young children did not have long <a href="attention%20span">attention span</a>s, so the new show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their audience's attention. As a result, each episode was structured like a <a href="magazine">magazine</a>, which made it possible for the producers to create a mixture of styles, paces, and characters. The structure allowed them to have flexibility, meaning that segments were dropped, modified, or added without affecting the rest of the show. As Lesser stated, "It is unlikely that any other approach would have provided enough room to present material on the wide range of goals we had selected". Producers found that if the show's segments were sufficiently varied in character, content, style, pace, and mood, children's attention was able to be sustained throughout each episode. The show's magazine format accommodated both the curriculum and its demanding production schedule.

At first, the show's "street scenes", which referred to the action taking place on the brownstone set, were not story-based. Instead, they consisted of individual segments connected to the curriculum and interrupted by inserts, or puppet skits, short films, and animations. By 1990, research had shown that children were able to follow a story, so the street scenes were changed to depict storylines. The writers presented a story, separated by several inserts, dispersed throughout the hour-long show. Although the stories were usually about 10–12 minutes in length, it would take 45 minutes to tell them. According to writer Tony Geiss, the addition of storylines changed the nature of the show.

During "Sesame Street"s development in 1968, the producers followed the recommendation of child psychologists, who advised them to not allow the direct interaction of the human actors and Muppets because the experts were concerned it would confuse and mislead young children. Shortly before the show's premiere, the producers created five one-hour episodes so that they could test if children found them comprehensible and appealing. They were never intended for broadcast, but were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia in July 1969. The producers found that the results were "generally very positive". However, children attended to the shows during the Muppet segments, but their interest was lost during the street scenes, which featured only humans and were considered "the glue" that "pulled the show together". The appeal of the test episodes was lower than they preferred, so the producers re-shot the street segments. Henson and his team created Muppets that could interact with the human actors; specifically, as the show's researchers put it, "two of "Sesame Street"s most enduring Muppets: <a href="Oscar%20the%20Grouch">Oscar the Grouch</a> and <a href="Big%20Bird">Big Bird</a>". The test episodes were responsible for what writer <a href="Malcolm%20Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a> called "the essence of "Sesame Street"—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults". CTW researcher Gerald Lesser called the producers' decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers "a turning point in the history of "Sesame Street"".

Animation was another important aspect of the structure of "Sesame Street". Lesser stated that one of the purposes of animation was to create incongruity, or what he called "illogical surprises". The first piece of animation commissioned by the CTW for "Sesame Street" was "the J commercial", in 1968, which they used in a study about its effectiveness in daycare centers in New York City. The CTW found that it was an effective tool in teaching children letters and numbers and that it effectively attracted children's attention. It also provided evidence, as writer Robert W. Morrow reported, that children were able to "endure enormous amounts of repetition". According to Morrow, the CTW's generalization from this study, which was later supported by outside studies, was that although repetition was an effective teaching method, repeated exposure "determined instructional effectiveness". "The J commercial" was a part of CTW's promotional film about "Sesame Street" and was used to demonstrate its teaching style to the press.

"Sesame Street"s animations and live-action films were usually commissioned to outside studios. For example, Misseri Studio in <a href="Florence%2C%20Italy">Florence, Italy</a> provided animations for the show for its entire run. Many animations, as well as the show's live-action films and longer segments like "<a href="Elmo%27s%20World">Elmo's World</a>" were created to accompany specific episodes, and became part of its library of shorts available for use in later episodes. Other films and animations were created as regular, recurring, and stand-alone segments. Gikow reported, "Virtually all animators and filmmakers supplying the show cite the enormous freedom given by producers, calling it a liberating force that let creativity explode on screen".

CTW's first producer responsible for the show's animation and live-action shorts was Lu Horne. His successor, Edith Zornow, was interested in what Gikow called "emerging talent", and as a result, the show worked with, as Gikow also stated, "animators and filmmakers on the cusp of fame". Animators who created pieces for "Sesame Street" included <a href="Bud%20Luckey">Bud Luckey</a>, Jeffrey Hale, <a href="Ernie%20Fosselius">Ernie Fosselius</a>, and others who went on to work at <a href="Pixar">Pixar</a>. Jim Henson was one of the many producers who created short films for the show.

As Gikow stated, "The expansion of the "Sesame Street" brand into films, videos, and television specials was a natural". There have been two full-length films produced: "<a href="Sesame%20Street%20Presents%20Follow%20That%20Bird">Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird</a>" (1985) and "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Elmo%20in%20Grouchland">The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland</a>" (1999). On June 18, 2012, <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> announced that a third "Sesame Street" film will be going into production with animator <a href="Joey%20Mazzarino">Joey Mazzarino</a> working on the screenplay. Starting in 1978 with "<a href="Christmas%20Eve%20on%20Sesame%20Street">Christmas Eve on Sesame Street</a>", there have been several television specials, and the "Sesame Street" Muppets have made several appearances on other programs throughout the years. Home videos, which emphasized specific curriculum goals, began to be produced in 1985.

"Sesame Street"s format remained intact until the 1990s. By then, its dominance was challenged by other programs such as "<a href="Blue%27s%20Clues">Blue's Clues</a>", and its ratings declined. New research, the growth of the children's home video industry, and the increase of 30-minute children's shows on cable demonstrated that the traditional magazine-format was not necessarily the most effective way to hold young viewers' attention. For "Sesame Street"s 30th anniversary in 1999, its producers researched the reasons for the show's lower ratings. For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed "Sesame Street"s content and structure during a series of two-week-long workshops. They also studied how children's viewing habits had changed and become more sophisticated in thirty years. They found that although the show was produced for 3-to-5-year-olds, children began watching it at a younger age. As a result, the target age for "Sesame Street" shifted downward, from 4 years to 3 years.

In 1998, a new 15-minute-long segment, created and developed by writers <a href="Judy%20Freudberg">Judy Freudberg</a> and Tony Geiss, that targeted the show's younger viewers and had a different format than the rest of the show, began to be shown at the end of each episode. The segment, called "<a href="Elmo%27s%20World">Elmo's World</a>", used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative, followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition. Unlike the realism of the rest of the show, "Elmo's World" took place in a stylized crayon-drawn universe as conceived by its host. <a href="Elmo">Elmo</a>, who represented the younger audience, was chosen as the host of the closing segment because younger toddlers identified with him and because he had always tested well with them.

In 2002, "Sesame Street"s producers went further in changing the show to reflect its younger audience and the increase in their viewers' sophistication. They expanded the "Elmo's World" concept by, as "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" TV critic Tim Goodman called it, "deconstructing" the show. They changed the structure of the entire show to a more narrative format, which made the show easier for young children to navigate. Arlene Sherman, a co-executive producer for 25 years, called the show's new look "startlingly different".

"Elmo's World" stopped production in 2009, when the producers of "Sesame Street" began taking steps to increase the age of their viewers and to increase the show's ratings, and because the show's curriculum was not designed for a younger audience. They were successful; by the end of the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, 3-year-old viewers had increased by 41 percent, 4-year-olds by 4 percent, and 5-year-olds by 21 percent. In 2012, "Elmo's World" was replaced by "Elmo the Musical"; even though it was designed for older viewers, the producers hoped that younger children would still enjoy it. "Elmo's World" segments continued to appear in repeats, DVDs, and on the show's website. "Elmo's World" returned in 2017.

Olivia Shakespear

Olivia Shakespear (née Tucker; 17 March 1863 – 3 October 1938) was a British <a href="novelist">novelist</a>, <a href="playwright">playwright</a>, and <a href="patron%20of%20the%20arts">patron of the arts</a>. She wrote six books that are described as "marriage problem" novels. Her works sold poorly, sometimes only a few hundred copies. Her last novel, "Uncle Hilary", is considered her best. She wrote two plays in collaboration with <a href="Florence%20Farr">Florence Farr</a>.

Olivia was the daughter of a retired <a href="Adjutant%20General">Adjutant General</a>, and had little formal education. She was well-read however, and developed a love of literature. In 1885 she married London <a href="barrister">barrister</a> Henry Hope Shakespear, and in 1886 gave birth to their only child, <a href="Dorothy%20Shakespear">Dorothy</a>. In 1894 her literary interests led to a friendship with <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a> that became physically intimate in 1896. He declared that they "had many days of happiness" to come, but the affair ended in 1897. They nevertheless remained lifelong friends and corresponded frequently. Yeats went on to marry <a href="Georgie%20Hyde-Lees">Georgie Hyde-Lees</a>, Olivia's step-niece and Dorothy's best friend.

Olivia began hosting weekly <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salons</a> frequented by <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> and other <a href="Modernism">modernist</a> writers and artists in 1909, and became influential in London <a href="literary%20society">literary society</a>. Olivia's daughter <a href="Dorothy%20Shakespear">Dorothy Shakespear</a> married Pound in 1914, despite the less than enthusiastic blessing of her parents. After their marriage, Pound would use funds received from Olivia to support <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> and <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>. When Dorothy gave birth to a son, <a href="Omar%20Pound">Omar Pound</a>, in France in 1926, Olivia assumed guardianship of the boy. He lived with Olivia until her death twelve years later, in 1938.

Olivia's father, Henry Tod Tucker, was born in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and joined the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a> as an <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> at age 16. He rose to the rank of Adjutant General in <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>, but retired in 1856 at age 48 owing to ill health. Within a year of returning to Britain he married Harriet Johnson (b. 1821) of <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>. The couple moved to the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> where their two daughters were born: Florence in 1858 and Olivia on 17 March 1863. Soon after they relocated to <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> where their third child, Henry, was born in 1866. In 1877 the family moved to London and raised their daughters in a social world that encouraged the pursuit of leisure. 

Olivia often visited her many Johnson relatives in the country, and became particularly fond of her cousin <a href="Lionel%20Johnson">Lionel Johnson</a>—the only one of many uncles and cousins not to join the military—who went on to become a poet and friend to <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>. It is likely that Olivia received little formal education; she may have been educated by tutors, and appears to have become well-read as a young woman.

In 1885 Olivia married Henry Hope Shakespear, a man described by Terence Brown in "The Life of W.B. Yeats: A Critical Biography" as "worthy" but "dull". Born in India in 1849, he was descended from 17th-century <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East London</a> <a href="Rope%23History">ropemakers</a> and, like Olivia, came from a military family, although of less prestige and wealth than the Tuckers and Johnsons.

Henry had attended <a href="Harrow%2C%20London">Harrow</a>, studied law, and joined a law practice in 1875. The couple were married on 8 December 1885, and honeymooned in <a href="Boulogne">Boulogne</a> and Paris. Olivia's father endowed them with a comfortable income in the form of a trust. Nine months after the wedding their only child, <a href="Dorothy%20Shakespear">Dorothy</a>, was born on 14 September 1886; Olivia realised soon that the marriage was devoid of passion. Yeats' biographer Alexander Jeffares writes, "she was unselfcentered, unselfish, deeply imaginative and sympathetic and, until she met Yeats, she seems to have accepted the fact of her unhappy loveless marriage".

Shakespear dissolved his legal partnership in the late 1880s—his partner may have been embezzling from clients' trusts—and formed his own practice. Harwood writes that Shakespear's attitude to the situation showed a certain amount of "timidity" on his part and a definite "dislike of scenes". During this period Olivia moved from socialising with military wives to literary women: Valentine Fox (unhappily married to a <a href="Kent">Kent</a> brewer) and Pearl Craigie, a divorced American writer who published as <a href="John%20Oliver%20Hobbes">John Oliver Hobbes</a>.

Accompanied by <a href="http%3A//rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/837">Pearl Craigie</a>, on 16 April 1894, Olivia attended a literary dinner to launch "<a href="The%20Yellow%20Book">The Yellow Book</a>". Olivia was seated opposite W. B. Yeats. Recently returned from visiting <a href="Maud%20Gonne">Maud Gonne</a> in Paris, Yeats was in London for the production of his play "<a href="The%20Land%20of%20Heart%27s%20Desire">The Land of Heart's Desire</a>". The two were not introduced that evening but Yeats, probably through Lionel Johnson (who became disruptively drunk at the dinner), enquired about the woman seated opposite. Yeats was deeply affected, later writing in his memoirs of the encounter: "I noticed opposite me ... a woman of great beauty ... She was exquisitely dressed ... and suggested to me an incomparable distinction." 

Soon after, Olivia attended a showing of "The Land of Heart's Desire", and found herself moved by the performance. She wanted to meet the "tall and black haired" poet and asked Johnson to invite Yeats to tea on 10 May 1894, adding in her handwriting to the invitation, "I shall be so glad to see you". In his "Memoirs" Yeats referred to her as "Diana Vernon", writing, "In this book I cannot giver her real name—Diana Vernon sounds pleasantly in my ears and will suit as well as any other".
They quickly established a strong friendship, with Olivia listening sympathetically to his obsessive love for Maud. When Yeats later described their friendship, he wrote, "I told her of my love sorrow, indeed it was my obsession, never leaving by day or night". Writing in "The Last Courtly Lover", Gloria Kline suggests Olivia and Yeats began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work. 

John Unterecker, writing in "Faces and False Faces", sees friendship as the most important aspect in the relationship, explaining, "she found in Yeats, as he in her, a person who could discuss literature and ideas ... she was one of the few persons with whom he could be completely relaxed". Comparing the difference between Maud and Olivia he writes, "Maud Gonne offered Yeats subject matter for poetry, the 'interesting' life he had hoped for, and Olivia Shakespear offered him repose". 

According to Kline, Yeats compared Olivia to <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a> and Maud to <a href="Helen%20of%20Troy">Helen</a>; he was attracted to dark coloured women, describing Olivia's skin as "a little darker than a Greek's would have been and her hair was very dark". Literary scholar <a href="Humphrey%20Carpenter">Humphrey Carpenter</a> writes that Yeats' impression of Olivia was one of a woman with "a profound culture, a knowledge of French, English, and Italian and seemed always at leisure. Her nature was gentle and contemplative, and she was content, it seems, to have no more of life than leisure and the talk of her friends". 

Nevertheless, she was working on her third novel, "Beauty's Hour", and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, suggested revisions, and may have contributed to the characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the <a href="occult">occult</a>. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.

In August Yeats returned to Ireland, continuing his correspondence with Olivia, writing to her about Maud who had recently given birth to a daughter, <a href="Iseult%20Gonne">Iseult</a>. In her letters Olivia may have been honest about her feelings toward him; in April 1895 he wrote to her, "I no more complain of your writing of love, than I would complain of a portrait painter keeping to portraits".

Yeats delayed visiting Olivia in London a month later; he instead tended to Johnson who was involved in the <a href="Oscar%20Wilde%23Trials">Wilde case</a> and descending into the alcoholism that would kill him. Yeats appeared to have persuaded himself that Olivia and her cousin shared a flaw, writing, "here is the same weakness I thought ... Her beauty ... dark and still, had the nobility of defeated things, and how could it help but wring my heart. I took a fortnight to decide what I should do". He constructed a plan to reconcile his desire with what he believed to be her wickedness: he would ask that she leave her husband to live with him. Until then their friendship would remain platonic.

Yeats finally visited Olivia at her Porchester Square home a few weeks later to present his well-thought out intentions but, to his bewilderment, Olivia declared her love for him. Unsure of himself, he took another absence, during which he decided that if Maud was unattainable, or unavailable due to circumstances, he would have Olivia, writing "but after all if I could not get the woman I loved it would be a comfort for a little while to devote myself to another". For Yeats, Olivia was willing to lose her daughter, financial security, social standing, and the goodwill of her family. Although her husband had grounds to sue Yeats and consequently destroy his reputation, her best hope against complete ruin was Shakespear's strong dislike of public scenes. Then Yeats lost his nerve again, suggesting instead each seek advice from a friend (a "sponsor"). He probably chose Florence Farr to be his sponsor while Olivia chose Valentine Fox—Harwood speculates that the sponsors advised the two to go ahead with the affair, perhaps to Yeats' discomfort. 

On 15 July 1895, Yeats and Olivia traveled to Kent to visit Valentine Fox; the trip Harwood says "would have been, emotionally speaking a highly charged outing". Of the railway trip, Yeats wrote in his memoirs, "when on our first railway journey together—we were to spend the day at Kent—she gave the long passionate kiss of love, I was startled & a little shocked". They went on to share more passionate kisses in art galleries and at her home.

Still distressed about Lionel, Yeats turned to <a href="Arthur%20Symons">Arthur Symons</a> for companionship, moving into a room adjacent to his in October 1895. One day while preoccupied and thinking about Maud he locked himself out for a visit just before Olivia and her sponsor arrived to visit; as soon as she left he stayed up all night telling Symons about Maud. She arrived in London a few weeks later for a brief visit. 

Yeats was ambivalent about Olivia despite the advice of the sponsors; with no money to support her, he suggested she seek a legal separation (instead of a divorce), sparing her social ostracism and financial ruin. Ezra Pound biographer Jay Wilhelm suggests Shakespear knew that Olivia loved Yeats but seemed more concerned about the loss of social status in the event of divorce, causing Yeats and Olivia to decide that "it was kinder to simply deceive him than totally abandon him". 

In January 1896 Yeats moved again, into a small flat in Woburn Place, so as to be nearer to her. Finally after a charged bed-buying session, with Yeats describing "an embarrassed conversation upon the width", and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers, he eventually wrote in January 1896, "at last she came to me in my thirtieth year ... and we had many days of happiness". Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.

Six months later he was in back in Ireland, and in August Olivia was visiting Valentine Fox with her husband where she received news of her father's death. She left for an extended stay in <a href="Torquay">Torquay</a> where she stayed until September before leaving for a visit to Scotland with her husband. Yeats left Ireland for Paris to visit Maud in November, and did not return to London until January 1897, with Maud following close behind and arriving in London in February. Yeats wrote of Maud's visit: "Maud wrote to me ... she was in London & would I come to dine. I dined with her & my trouble increased—she certainly had no thought of the mischief she was doing – & at last one morning ... [Olivia] found my mood did not answer hers and & burst into tears—'There is someone else in your heart' she said. It was the breaking between us for many years". The affair ended that spring when Yeats again returned to Ireland. Olivia did not visit him again at Woburn Place for many years, according to Yeats biographer Richard Ellmann.

Olivia's life is not well documented between 1897 and 1908. She visited her cousin Lionel for the last time in 1897 before he was isolated by his alcoholism. He died alone of a <a href="cerebral%20haemorrhage">cerebral haemorrhage</a> in 1902. In 1899 the family suffered an unspecified financial setback that forced them to move into an apartment in <a href="Bayswater">Bayswater</a> to Pembroke Mansions, which a friend described by as "an uninviting Bayswater slum". A few months later Olivia's mother died. Within a week Olivia received a letter of condolence from Yeats, which may have been the first letter she received from him in two years, since 1897. Several scholars and biographers speculate that they resumed their love affair at some point between 1903 and 1910; Pound biographer Wilhelm believes they reconciled as early as 1903, while Yeats biographers Jeffares and Ross suggest the affair likely reignited for a period in 1906.

For a short time in 1901 Olivia held a position as a book reviewer for "The Kensington Review", a small literary magazine, until it succumbed to poor sales. After, she dabbled in the <a href="occult">occult</a> and became friendly with prominent London occultists. In 1902 she co-wrote with Florence Farr — who for a time led the <a href="Hermetic%20Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Dawn">Order of Golden Dawn</a> — two plays on the occult, "The Beloved of Hathor" and "The Shrine of the Golden Hawk", which were subsequently published as a pair.

Although the family received an inheritance from Olivia's mother, they continued to live in Bayswater. For a period Dorothy was at boarding school, after which she was sent to a finishing school in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>. To save money, the family often left London during the summer, to take long visits to relatives in the country, in particular her brother Henry Tucker. Not until 1905 did the family lease a house in Brunswick Gardens, near <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a>, when Dorothy returned home to live with her parents.

Records of Olivia's life resume through Dorothy's letters and diaries surrounding the arrival of the American poet <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> in London in 1909. Following her friends in <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a> society, Olivia opened her home once a week for a <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a>, beginning an important period in her life. When Yeats returned to London that year, Olivia became the centre of a blossoming literary movement. Yeats held a Monday evening salon; those who attended usually also visited Olivia's. She hosted, and became a nexus for, much of the pre-war literary activity in London. Notable attendees included Pound, <a href="H.D.">Hilda Doolitle</a>, Yeats, <a href="Wyndham%20Lewis">Wyndham Lewis</a>, <a href="Henri%20Gaudier-Brzeska">Henri Gaudier-Brzeska</a>, <a href="Walter%20Morse%20Rummel">Walter Morse Rummel</a>, <a href="Richard%20Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>, <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>, <a href="T.%20E.%20Hulme">T. E. Hulme</a> and <a href="John%20Cournos">John Cournos</a>. The gatherings were held in her drawing room, a place Pound described in a letter as "full of white magic". Olivia was by now a well-known occultist and hosted <a href="s%C3%A9ances">séances</a> in her drawing room. She became well-versed in <a href="astrology">astrology</a> and <a href="palmistry">palmistry</a>, passing on what she knew to Dorothy who shared her interest. Both read <a href="grimoire">grimoire</a>s; Olivia was an expert at "drawing occult symbols" and quite familiar with the symbology of the occult. 

Olivia met Pound in January 1909 at a Kensington salon hosted by a friend; she invited him for tea on 16 February 1909, and, at his insistence, introduced Pound to Yeats in May 1909. Yeats had recently returned to London and began a thorough investigation of spiritualism and the occult, turning to Olivia for advice. She took the young American poet to Yeats' rooms at Woburn Place, fostering their relationship.

Dorothy soon fell in love with Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy attended his lectures at the <a href="London%20Polytechnic%20Institution">London Polytechnic Institution</a>; in June 1910 they joined him in <a href="Sirmione">Sirmione</a>, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although uncertain whether he intended to stay in New York or return to London.

In 1910 Yeats thought his <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a> suggested a return to Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. Pound was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude to Pound. A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to <a href="Georgie%20Hyde-Lees">Georgie Hyde-Lees</a>, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.

Pound returned from America in 1911 and resumed his visits to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused on the basis of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family drawing room once a week or every two weeks.

Olivia became concerned about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and <a href="Richard%20Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You told me you were prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way ... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly "decent"! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come & see her ... She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate ... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her!

In 1913, Olivia introduced Pound to <a href="vorticism">vorticist</a> sculptor <a href="Henri%20Gaudier-Brzeska">Henri Gaudier-Brzeska</a> at an art exhibition at the <a href="Albert%20Hall">Albert Hall</a>. At the same exhibition the sculptor met <a href="Nina%20Hamnett">Nina Hamnett</a>, whom he subsequently used as a model for a series of nudes bronzes, one of which Olivia bought. In 1914, Olivia translated a grimoire for Yeats and Pound, who spent November 1913 to January 1914 in the countryside at Stone Cottage in Ashdown Forest—Pound acting as secretary to Yeats—researching the occult. They read several grimoires, and Olivia provided for them a translation of the Abbot of Villar's 1670 grimoire "Le Comte de Gabalis". Her translation was serialised in the literary magazine "<a href="The%20Egoist%20%28periodical%29">The Egoist</a>" later that year.

By 1914 Olivia seems to have realised that Dorothy was determined to marry Pound, and finally consented; ironically Pound was then earning less than he had in 1911. Hope Shakespear relented when the couple agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20 April 1914. Olivia gave them two early circus drawings by <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>.

After Dorothy's wedding much of the documentation of Olivia's life ceases. She moved out of Brunswick Gardens in 1924, throwing away personal correspondence and giving away hundreds of books. Hope Shakespear died on 5 July 1923; within months Olivia moved to an apartment in <a href="West%20Kensington">West Kensington</a>, taking with her two maids who had been with the family for decades. Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events. In September 1926, Dorothy gave birth to a son, <a href="Omar%20Pound">Omar Pound</a>, who in 1927 was brought from France to be raised in England. Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.
In 1926 Yeats spent several weeks in London, likely visiting Olivia frequently. He showed regret for his behaviour in 1897, writing to her, "I came across two early photographs of you yesterday ... Who ever had a like profile?—a profile from a Sicilian coin. One looks back to one's youth as to a cup that a mad man dying of thirst left half tasted. I wonder if you feel like that?" The two maintained their correspondence, as they had for many years.

Olivia continued to socialise and had many friends, one of whom, Wyndham Lewis, painted her portrait; he enjoyed her company despite finding it difficult to relate to others. She stopped writing but remained an avid reader, turning to detective stories for light relief although she also kept up with literary authors. She became friendly with <a href="Thomas%20MacGreevy">Thomas MacGreevy</a>, whom she invited for tea, later writing to him, "WBY has given me the new edition of "Reveries and the Veil", & I am re-reading it all. It is very beautifully done. He was about 29 when I first knew him". McGreevy told Yeats that Olivia was "always a symbol of elegance, a kind of gold and ivory image". Harwood writes of her, "Olivia Shakespear was avant-garde in literature, agnostic in religion, and conservative in politics, at least later in life".

Olivia's correspondence with Pound continued throughout the 1920s and 1930s, when she acted in part as his agent in London. In 1924, at Pound's request, she welcomed <a href="George%20Antheil">George Antheil</a> into her social circle, procured artwork and books that were sent on to Dorothy and Ezra in <a href="Rapallo">Rapallo</a>, and mediated in a dispute between Pound and Lewis. She was uninterested in Pound's politics and economic views and particularly disliked his later <a href="The%20Cantos">Cantos</a>. After her husband's death, Olivia's income was sufficient to support a comfortable lifestyle. During the 1920s and 1930s she gradually increased Dorothy's income (which was also increased by various family bequests), and in the 1930s she made investments in Dorothy's name, sending the proceeds to Dorothy and Pound. In a very real sense, according to Harwood, Olivia Shakespear is the "unsung heroine" of the modernist period, because much of the money Ezra Pound generously used to support struggling writers such as <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a> and <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a> came from her.

Olivia died of complications brought on by <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> disease on 3 October 1938. The day before her death she wrote in a letter to Dorothy: "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went ... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman ... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude ... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.

Dorothy was ill when her mother died, unable to travel to London. She sent Pound to organise the funeral and to clear out the house. Ezra sorted through Olivia's correspondence and returned to Yeats many of her letters. Unterecker writes that Yeats made an effort to keep the correspondence private: "Shortly before his death he methodically destroyed a large group of letters to Olivia Shakespear. These, returned to him after her death ... Yeats wanted no one to read".

Olivia had six novels published between 1894 and 1910, which as described by Foster are about women unhappy in love, with insipid and uninspiring male characters. The heroines—frequently orphaned, educated by elderly tutors, and depicted in country house libraries—fall in love with much older men in the later novels.

The first two novels were published in 1894 to mixed reviews. "Love on a Mortal Lease" (title from <a href="George%20Meredith">George Meredith</a>) was released in June, followed in November by "The Journey of High Honour", at 30,000 words considerably shorter than the 355 pages of "Love on a Mortal Lease". Each novel sold only a few hundred copies. Harwood describes the early work such as "Love on a Mortal Lease" as showing stylistic similarities to contemporary women novelists such as Craighie and Rhonda Broughton, with witty dialogue in Craighie's style, although he thinks Olivia brought a more serious voice to her work. He describes "Love on a Mortal Lease" as a work in which the heroine is well-characterised but the background is weak.

In the summer of 1896, "The Savoy," edited by Arthur Symons, published a two-part novella by Shakespear called "Beauty's Hour". Anne Margaret Daniel says that the story was inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1886), with the dilemma of good vs. evil translated here into that of an unattractive woman who longs for beauty. In 2016, Valancourt Books published Daniel's edition of "Beauty's Hour", marking the first return to print of Shakespear's fiction for many decades.

She dedicated "The False Laurel", published in 1896, to Lionel Johnson. The plot features a poetess who falls in love with and marries an insipid young poet, giving up her own writing to attend to his needs. She becomes bored, writes a successful play, and then goes mad. "The False Laurel" was the least successful of her books, selling fewer than 200 copies. It received a poor review from "<a href="The%20Bookman%20%28London%29">The Bookman</a>" but a good one from "The Athenaeneum".

"Rupert Armstrong" was published in 1899 by <a href="Harper%20%28publisher%29">Harper and Brothers</a>, dedicated to Valentine Fox. In this, the fourth of her novels, Harwood believes her writing and voice became more original. The complicated plot—a mother and daughter struggle for "possession of the [father's] artistic soul"—shows hints of incestuous love, a theme found in her later work. Written during the affair with Yeats, Harwood sees the characters presented "in a precise, bitter intensity unlike anything in the earlier work".

"The Devotees" was published by Heinemann in December 1900. Like "Rupert Armstrong", the plot of "The Devotees" depicts a mildly incestuous love: a young man and girl, raised together since childhood, devote themselves for decades to his drug-addicted mother before they marry. The reviews were mostly unkind.

Olivia's final novel, "Uncle Hilary," was published in 1910 and is considered her best work. Of "Uncle Hilary" Jane Eldridge Miller writes in "Rebel Women: Feminism, Modernism, and the Edwardian Novel", "Shakespear demonstrates the ways in which that ideal leads to disillusionment and resentment". In the complicated plot a young woman unwittingly marries her stepfather, leaves him, and accepts a marriage proposal from her guardian. Harwood believes her loveless marriage, the love affair with Yeats, the frustration with Dorothy, and Pound's unfaithfulness to Dorothy, built in her a strength and acceptance of life that bordered on the spiritual and she no longer needed to write. 

Miller writes that in the novel Olivia explores "marriage laws, divorce, and bigamy", with a focus on the nature of romantic love—rejected in favour of spiritual and intellectual pursuits. Leon Surette writes in "The Birth of Modernism", Olivia's "Uncle Hilary" highlights the ties between spiritualism, occultism and feminism, seeing "Uncle Hilary" as a feminist novel which he describes as "quite readable".

Jane Miller characterises the works as "marriage problem" novels in which the wife confronts the reality of marriage, its restrictions, and the need to achieve independence. By finding interests outside marriage the wife loses the overwhelming need for love within the marriage. Miller writes that in "Uncle Hilary" Olivia examines issues such as marriage laws, divorce, and bigamy, while focusing on the nature of romantic love. It was in "Uncle Hilary" that Olivia wrote of love: "Love is the worst slavery that exists ... it is the most persistent of illusions".

Pennatomys

Pennatomys nivalis is an extinct <a href="Oryzomyini">oryzomyine</a> rodent from the islands of <a href="Sint%20Eustatius">Sint Eustatius</a>, <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a>, and <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a> in the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. The only species in the genus Pennatomys, it is known from skeletal remains found in <a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a> archeological sites on all three islands, with dates ranging from 790–520 <a href="BCE">BCE</a> to 900–1200 CE. No live specimens are known, but there are several historical records of rodents from Saint Kitts and Nevis that could conceivably refer to "Pennatomys". The animal apparently belongs to a group within the <a href="tribe%20%28taxonomy%29">tribe</a> Oryzomyini that includes many other island-dwelling species.

"Pennatomys nivalis" was a medium-sized species without many distinctive adaptations. The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s were short and blunt-ended. The <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>, a bony plate at the side of the skull, was broad. The bony <a href="palate">palate</a> was long and flat. The root of the lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a> was housed in a bony protuberance, the <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>. The <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a>s. The upper molars all had three roots.

<a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a>, also known as rice rats, is a diverse grouping of North, Central, and South American rodents within the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>. Remains of extinct rice rats are known throughout the Lesser Antilles, but the systematic relationships among those animals are poorly understood, and many species remain unnamed. Rice rat fossils were first recorded from <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a> in 1907 by archeologist C.W. Branch and were later found in abundance in <a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a> archeological sites on nearby <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a> and <a href="Sint%20Eustatius">Sint Eustatius</a>. The rice rat of these islands was formally described and named as "Pennatomys nivalis" in a 2010 article by zoologist Samuel Turvey and coworkers. The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "Pennatomys", combines the Latin "pennatus" "winged" with "-mys" "mouse", a standard element in the names of rodent genera, and honors archeologist <a href="Elizabeth%20Wing">Elizabeth Wing</a>. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "nivalis", is Latin for "snowy" and refers to Nevis. This island's name derives from the Spanish "Nuestra Señora de las Nieves" "Our Lady of the Snows", a reference to the clouds (mistaken for snow) that surround the island's central peak.

<a href="Cladistics">Cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> characters suggest that "Pennatomys" is most closely related to a <a href="clade">clade</a>, the "Nectomys" subclade, that includes members of "<a href="Aegialomys">Aegialomys</a>", "<a href="Amphinectomys">Amphinectomys</a>", "<a href="Nectomys">Nectomys</a>", "<a href="Sigmodontomys">Sigmodontomys</a>", "<a href="Melanomys">Melanomys</a>", "<a href="Megalomys">Megalomys</a>" (another Antillean rice rat), and possibly "<a href="Nesoryzomys">Nesoryzomys</a>". However, the exact position of "Pennatomys" was poorly resolved because of missing data. Turvey and colleagues placed "P. nivalis" as the only member of its own genus because of its distinctive characters and the absence of evidence for close relationships with any other oryzomyine genus. "Pennatomys" probably belongs to a subgroup of Oryzomyini known as "<a href="Oryzomyini%23clade%20D">clade D</a>". This clade contains a number of species only occurring on islands—including members of "Aegialomys", "Megalomys", "Nesoryzomys", "<a href="Noronhomys">Noronhomys</a>", "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>", and "Pennatomys". Turvey and colleagues suggested that this is related to the high proportion of <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> species in clade D—most other oryzomyines are forest dwellers. As a whole, Oryzomyini includes over a hundred species in about thirty genera. It is one of several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, which encompasses hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents, distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas. However DNA analysis demonstrated a sister-taxa relationship with "Megalomys" as an <a href="endemic">endemic</a> Lesser Antillean radiation within clade D, and also showed that the different island populations showed a high degree of genetic differentiation from each other.

A medium-sized oryzomyine, "Pennatomys" is known from a number of skeletal remains, many of which are fragmentary. Both skull and <a href="postcranial">postcranial</a> bones are represented. Although there are no unusual adaptations in the known material, the animal possesses a combination of characteristics that distinguish it from all other known oryzomyines. The skull is known only from fragments. The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s extend back to a point before or slightly behind the point where the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ry, <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal</a>, and <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a>s meet, and have a blunt back margin. The nasals extend slightly further back than the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>ries. The lacrimals <a href="articulation%20%28anatomy%29">articulate</a> with both the frontals and the maxillaries, a trait that distinguishes "Pennatomys" from its closest relatives (which have lacrimals articulating mainly with the frontals). The <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> of the skull bears weak crests at its sides. The <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>, a bony plate at the side of the skull, is broad and its back margin is located in front of the first upper <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> (M1). The <a href="incisive%20foramina">incisive foramina</a>, openings in the bony <a href="palate">palate</a>, extend back to a point next to the front root of M1. The palate itself is long and flat, extending beyond the third upper molars (M3). In the <a href="mandible%20%28anatomy%29">mandible</a> (lower jaw), there is a <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>—a protuberance at the back of the jawbone that houses the root of the lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a>. Below the molars, the upper and lower <a href="masseteric%20ridges">masseteric ridges</a> (crests which support some of the chewing muscles) are sometimes conjoined towards the front, and they extend forward to a point below the first lower molar (m1). The conjoined crests are one of the <a href="synapomorphic">synapomorphic</a> (shared-derived) characters of the "Nectomys" subclade.

The maxillary toothrows are parallel to each other. The molars are <a href="bunodont">bunodont</a> (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests) and <a href="brachyodont">brachyodont</a> (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a <a href="Cingulum%20%28tooth%29">cingulum</a> (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike in most of the closest relatives of "Pennatomys", there is no additional labial root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at the front and back and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at the front and back. Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7 mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4 mm.

On M1, the <a href="anterocone">anterocone</a> (the cusp at the front of the tooth) is not divided into smaller cuspules. The connection between the <a href="protocone">protocone</a> and the <a href="paracone">paracone</a>, the major cusps immediately after the anterocone, is located relatively far toward the front. Behind the paracone, the <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a> accessory crest is present. On M2, there is no <a href="protoflexus">protoflexus</a> (an indentation in front of the protocone, which on this tooth is the frontmost cusp) and the valley between the paracone and the mesoloph, the <a href="mesoflexus">mesoflexus</a>, is not divided into two pieces by a paracone–mesoloph connection. These traits are both characteristic of the "Nectomys" subclade. The mesoloph is present on M3, but the <a href="posteroloph">posteroloph</a>, a crest at the back of the tooth, is absent or <a href="vestigial">vestigial</a>, as is the <a href="hypoflexus">hypoflexus</a> (the valley between the protocone and the cusp behind it, the <a href="hypocone">hypocone</a>). The absence or near-absence of the posteroloph is a distinctive trait that differentiates "Pennatomys" from related oryzomyines.

The <a href="anteroconid">anteroconid</a> on m1 (the frontmost cusp, corresponding to the anterocone) contains an internal hollow, an anteromedian fossettid. There is an <a href="ectolophid">ectolophid</a>, an accessory crest in the valley between the <a href="protoconid">protoconid</a> (the cusp on the labial side, behind the anteroconid) and the <a href="hypoconid">hypoconid</a> (the cusp behind the protoconid, at the back labial corner of the tooth). On the other side of the tooth, the <a href="mesolophid">mesolophid</a> (another accessory crest) is also present. On each of the lower molars, an <a href="anterolabial%20cingulum">anterolabial cingulum</a> (a shelf on the front labial corner) is present. On m2 and m3, an <a href="anterolophid">anterolophid</a> is present—a crest in front of the <a href="metaconid">metaconid</a> (the cusp on the front lingual corner of the tooth).

Remains of "Pennatomys nivalis" come from several Amerindian archeological sites on each of the three islands where it has been found; it was eaten by the native Amerindian population. The oldest site is <a href="Hichmans%27%20Shell%20Heap">Hichmans' Shell Heap</a> on Nevis, which is from the Archaic age and is dated to 790 to 520 <a href="BCE">BCE</a>. The youngest, <a href="Sulphur%20Ghaut">Sulphur Ghaut</a> (900–1200 CE), is also on Nevis, and is from the post-<a href="Saladoid">Saladoid</a> period. Other sites on Nevis include <a href="Hichmans">Hichmans</a> (Saladoid, 100 BCE – 600 CE), <a href="Indian%20Castle">Indian Castle</a> (post-Saladoid, 650–880 CE), and <a href="Coconut%20Walk">Coconut Walk</a> (post-Saladoid, no absolute dates known). The only site on Sint Eustatius is the Saladoid and post-Saladoid site <a href="Golden%20Rock%20%28archeological%20site%29">Golden Rock</a> (80 BCE – 980 CE). Each of the three sites yielding "Pennatomys" on Saint Kitts is from the post-Saladoid period: <a href="Sugar%20Factory">Sugar Factory</a> (700–1000 CE), <a href="Bloody%20Point">Bloody Point</a> (660–1115 CE), and <a href="Cayon">Cayon</a> (undated).

Unambiguous historical records of "Pennatomys" are lacking, but there are some references to Saint Kitts and Nevis rodents that may relate to it. <a href="George%20Percy">George Percy</a> reported on the presence of "great store of Conies" on Nevis around 1606, probably a reference to the <a href="Dasyprocta">agoutis</a> ("Dasyprocta") that have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> throughout the Lesser Antilles. There are references from 1631 and 1720 to people eating rats on Saint Kitts and Nevis, respectively, but these may well have been introduced <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a>s ("Rattus rattus"), not "Pennatomys". There are anecdotal records of unusual rats on Nevis up to recent times; these were reportedly eaten by the islanders until the 1930s. Surveys on Nevis in 2009 found no evidence for the survival of "Pennatomys". The extinction of the Antillean rice rats, including "Pennatomys", may have resulted from the introduction of exotic animals such as the black rat and the <a href="small%20Asian%20mongoose">small Asian mongoose</a> ("Herpestes auropunctatus") to the Lesser Antilles.

There are no known morphological differences between the three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands. Such a difference in size might be related to the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis, in accordance with the trend that animals become larger on larger islands. However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences in the mode of exploitation by Amerindians.

Ian Dougald McLachlan

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Ian Dougald McLachlan, <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">CB</a>, <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> (23 July 1911 – 14 July 1991) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Born in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, he was a cadet at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, before joining the Air Force in December 1930. After serving in <a href="Flight%20instructor">instructional</a> and general flying roles, he took command of <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> in December 1939, leading it into action in the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a> less than a year later. Awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, he returned to Australia in 1942 to command air bases in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> and Melbourne. The following year he was posted to the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>, where he led successively <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">Nos. 71</a> and <a href="No.%2073%20Wing%20RAAF">73 Wings</a>. Having been promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, he took charge of <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area Command</a> in 1944, and <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> the following year.

Raised to acting <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> in 1946, McLachlan served as senior air staff officer for the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Air Group</a> in Japan until 1948. After leading <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Area Command</a> in 1951–53, he was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> and posted to Britain, where he attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a>. Promoted air vice marshal, he returned to Australia in 1957 as Air Officer Commanding <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Training Command</a>; in this role he carried out two major reviews focussing on the RAAF's educational and command systems. He was <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> from 1959 to 1961, and then Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, until 1963. Appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1966, McLachlan's final post before retiring in 1968 was as Air Member for Supply and Equipment. He was a consultant to <a href="Northrop%20Corporation">Northrop</a> after leaving the RAAF, and lived in <a href="Darling%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Darling Point</a>, Sydney, until his death in 1991.

The son of Dugald and Bertha McLachlan, Ian McLachlan was born in the <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> suburb of <a href="South%20Yarra%2C%20Victoria">South Yarra</a>, Victoria, on 23 July 1911. Following education at <a href="Melbourne%20High%20School">Melbourne High School</a>, he entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1928. He was one of four cadets sponsored that year by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), which did not at that stage have its own officer training college. Budgetary constraints imposed by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> necessitated the transfer of these cadets out of Duntroon midway through their four-year course. Although offered positions in the <a href="Australian%20Public%20Service">Australian Public Service</a> or nominations for short-term commissions with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, all were determined to serve with the RAAF, apparently "delighted" at the prospect of entering their chosen service early.

Enlisting in the Air Force on 10 December 1930, McLachlan completed his flight training the following year. He was commissioned as a pilot in 1932, and undertook various flight-instruction and general duties roles over the next five years. In 1937, he was a member of the RAAF contingent posted to Britain to celebrate the coronation of King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a>. Ranked <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, he was given command of <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron</a>, operating <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a> fighters out of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, on 4 December 1939. He was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> on 1 February 1940, and led his unit to the Middle East on 15 July.

Sailing via <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, India, No. 3 Squadron arrived at <a href="Suez">Suez</a>, Egypt, in late August 1940. In its original army cooperation role supporting the Australian <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> in the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>, the squadron was equipped with obsolescent <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Gladiator</a> biplane fighters and <a href="Westland%20Lysander">Westland Lysander</a> observation aircraft. As part of his unit's work-up for operations, McLachlan organised training exercises with the 6th Division, as well as written exams to test his men's knowledge of army jargon and air-to-ground communications.

Described by historian Alan Stephens as "acerbic but capable", McLachlan led No. 3 Squadron through the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sidi%20Barrani">Battle of Sidi Barrani</a> in December 1940, followed by the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bardia">Battle of Bardia</a> and the <a href="Operation%20Compass%23Tobruk">capture of Tobruk</a> in January 1941. Prior to converting to <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s that month, the unit was credited with destroying twelve Italian aircraft for the loss of five Gladiators and two pilots; McLachlan shot down a <a href="Fiat%20CR.42">Fiat CR.42</a> on 10 December 1940, the same action in which fellow squadron member and future <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a> <a href="Gordon%20Steege">Gordon Steege</a> claimed his first "kill". Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief <a href="RAF%20Middle%20East%20Command">RAF Middle East</a>, Air Marshal Sir <a href="Arthur%20Longmore">Arthur Longmore</a>, praised McLachlan and his squadron for their "high morale and adaptability to desert conditions".

McLachlan was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) for his "fine qualities as a fighter pilot" and "determined leadership" in the face of often "overwhelming numbers of enemy aircraft"; the citation was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 11 February 1941 under the name "Ian Duncan MacLachlan". He was the first RAAF fighter pilot to be decorated in World War II. Promoted to <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, he took charge of the newly established <a href="Benina%20International%20Airport">RAF Benina</a>, <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>, on 13 February, handing over No. 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader <a href="Peter%20Jeffrey%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Peter Jeffrey</a>. By May 1941, McLachlan was acting as RAAF Liaison Officer for the new Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, RAF Middle East, Air Marshal <a href="Arthur%20Tedder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tedder">Arthur Tedder</a>. The <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a> in Melbourne, chaired by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a>, was not consulted over this change of role and took exception to the RAF's "unilateral action" in appointing McLachlan, but eventually acquiesced and permitted him to remain at the post to coordinate facilities for RAAF personnel in the region until July, when he was recalled to Australia.

In 1942 McLachlan took command of <a href="Fairbairn%2C%20Canberra">RAAF Station Canberra</a>, and, later in the year, <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria. Posted for action in <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a>, he became the inaugural commander of <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a> at <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> in February 1943. The wing consisted of <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 Squadron</a> (flying <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s), <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron</a> (<a href="P-40%20Kittyhawk">P-40 Kittyhawk</a>s), <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron</a> (Kittyhawks), and <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 100 Squadron</a> (<a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s). It came under the control of <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group</a>, the RAAF's "premier fighting unit" in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA), whose purpose was to act as a mobile strike force in support of advancing Allied troops. In March the Beauforts took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, "the decisive aerial engagement" in the SWPA according to General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, though they were unable to score any hits against Japanese ships.
By June 1943, McLachlan had been promoted <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> and given command of <a href="No.%2073%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 73 Wing</a>. He established his headquarters at <a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a>, where he was responsible for organising the wing into a fighter formation consisting of <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 Squadron</a> (Kittyhawks), No. 77 Squadron (Kittyhawks) and <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 79 Squadron</a> (<a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfires</a>). As well as providing local air defence, and fighter escort for Australian bombers, the Kittyhawks were armed with <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiary</a> and general-purpose bombs so that they could engage in <a href="close%20air%20support">ground attack</a> missions, a practice that had already been employed by Commonwealth forces in the Middle Eastern theatre. In August, the wing transferred to <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina</a>, while No. 9 Group's other combat formation, No. 71 Wing, took over responsibility for Goodenough. Appointed senior air staff officer (SASO) at No. 9 Group, McLachlan handed over command of No. 73 Wing to Wing Commander Gordon Steege in October 1943. Towards the end of his posting to No. 9 Group, McLachlan told its former commander, Air Commodore <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a>, that the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">USAAF</a> was "leaping ahead" of the RAAF, which was being left to "clean up the remnants" of Japanese resistance. He feared that Australian fighter pilots especially would be "increasingly restless if the Americans took all the fighting plums". Barely a year later, morale among senior RAAF fighter pilots had dropped to such an extent that eight of them tried to resign their commissions in the so-called "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>".

In March 1944, McLachlan took charge of <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area Command</a>, Melbourne, with responsibility for <a href="maritime%20patrol">maritime patrol</a>, <a href="Convoy">convoy escort</a> and <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a> in southern Australian waters; he handed over to Group Captain <a href="Charles%20Eaton%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Eaton</a> the following January. <a href="Mentioned%20in%20despatches">Mentioned in despatches</a> on 9 March 1945 for his "gallant and distinguished service", McLachlan returned to action in the South-West Pacific as commander of <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a>, which comprised Nos. 76, 77 and <a href="No.%2082%20Squadron%20RAAF">82 Squadron</a>s, operating Kittyhawks. As part of the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, the wing was slated to take part in Operation Oboe One, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29">Battle of Tarakan</a>, in May but was unable to relocate from <a href="Numfor">Noemfoor</a> to its new base on <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> in time. It fought in Operation Oboe Six, the <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Borneo">invasion of Labuan</a>, from June and was based on the island when the Pacific War ended in August 1945.

Following the end of hostilities, McLachlan volunteered to serve with the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Japan">Allied occupation forces in Japan</a>. He married Margaret Helen Chrystal on 5 January 1946; they had a son and a daughter. Promoted to acting <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> on 1 March, he was appointed SASO of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Air Group</a> (BCAIR), headquartered in <a href="Kure">Kure</a> and responsible for No. 81 Wing RAAF, as well as squadrons from the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a>, and <a href="Indian%20Air%20Force">Indian Air Force</a>. Returning to Australia in 1948, he served as Air Commodore Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, at which time the <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> was ordered as Australia's first jet bomber, partly for its ability to deliver <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. He completed his term in September 1951 and took over <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Area Command</a>, based at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland. Following his appointment as a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1954 <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">New Year's Honours</a>, McLachlan was posted to Britain for three years, first attending the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a>, London, and then serving as RAF Director of Flying Training at the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> during 1955–56. Raised to air vice-marshal, he returned to Australia in 1957 to become Air Officer Commanding (AOC) <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Training Command</a> in Melbourne.

As AOC Training Command, McLachlan undertook two reviews that would have, according to the official history of the post-war RAAF, "a significant effect on the Air Force of the 1960s". In 1957, at the instigation of the Air Member for Personnel, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>, McLachlan formed a committee to review the effectiveness of the syllabus at <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a> for meeting the future needs of the Air Force in an age of <a href="Missile%20guidance">guided missile</a>s and nuclear weaponry. This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the college was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. The official history of the RAAF considered the result to be only partially successful; while it turned out highly educated officers, they were educated solely in a rigid scientific discipline suited to an Air Force that never came into existence, one relying on missiles rather than manned aircraft. In 1959, McLachlan chaired a committee to review the change in the RAAF's command structure that had taken place in 1953–54, from a geographically based <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">"area" system</a> to a functional system consisting of <a href="RAAF%20Home%20Command">Home</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Command</a>, and <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training Commands</a>. Concluding that this had reduced duplication and improved efficiency, he proposed further rationalisation by amalgamating Training and Maintenance Commands to form a new organisation, <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a>. His plan was duly implemented, as was his recommendation that Home Command, responsible for air operations, be renamed <a href="RAAF%20Operational%20Command">Operational Command</a>.
McLachlan was appointed <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> in 1959, before being posted to <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, as <a href="attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> heading up the Australian Joint Services Staff in 1961. During his term in the US, Australia ordered the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> swing-wing bomber as a replacement for the Canberra. Despite what was touted as a firm timetable and cost schedule for the order, McLachlan confided to a colleague that he had serious concerns about when and if the RAAF would actually get the F-111, and what the final cost would be. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "even for such a shrewd and sardonic man as McLachlan, that was to prove a painfully prescient observation", as the new bomber was delivered six years late and massively over budget. Following his return from Washington, McLachlan became Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) in February 1964. As AMSE he sat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers, chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. In this position he worked to increase the proportion of tertiary educated supply officers, following similar achievements among engineering officers in the RAAF's Technical Branch. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the 1966 New Year's Honours, the citation noting particularly his chairmanship of the two "historic" committees that reorganised RAAF College and the Air Force's command structure in the late 1950s. The use of <a href="electronic%20data%20processing">electronic data processing</a> became more widespread during McLachlan's tenure as AMSE, and by 1968 the RAAF's supply system had been computerised.

McLachlan completed his term as Air Member for Supply and Equipment on 23 July 1968 and retired from the RAAF; he was divorced from his wife the same year. Upon leaving the military, he became an aeronautical consultant to the <a href="Northrop%20Corporation">Northrop Corporation</a>, and chairman of Information Electronics Pty Ltd from 1983, serving in both positions until 1987. He was also chairman of <a href="Pokolbin%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Pokolbin Winemakers</a> from 1970 through 1975. In retirement he continued to exercise his interest in Australia's defence, joining in 1975 a group of <a href="pundit">pundit</a>s, including former Chief of the Air Staff <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Sir Alister Murdoch</a>, who promoted the addition of nuclear weapons to the country's arsenal. A resident of Sydney's <a href="Darling%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Darling Point</a>, Ian McLachlan died on 14 July 1991.

Social history of viruses

The social history of viruses describes the influence of <a href="virus">virus</a>es and viral infections on human history. <a href="Epidemic">Epidemic</a>s caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the <a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">Neolithic period</a>, around 12,000 years ago, when humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities. This allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become <a href="endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a>. <a href="Plant%20virus">Viruses of plants</a> and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as <a href="potyvirus">potyvirus</a>es of potatoes and <a href="rinderpest">rinderpest</a> of cattle had devastating consequences.

<a href="Smallpox">Smallpox</a> and <a href="measles">measles</a> viruses are among the oldest that infect humans. Having evolved from viruses that infected other animals, they first appeared in humans in Europe and North Africa thousands of years ago. The viruses were later carried to the New World by Europeans during the time of the <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish Conquests</a>, but the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous people</a> had no natural resistance to the viruses and millions of them died during epidemics. Influenza <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>s have been recorded since 1580, and they have occurred with increasing frequency in subsequent centuries. The <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">pandemic of 1918–19</a>, in which 40–50 million died in less than a year, was one of the most devastating in history.

<a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> and <a href="Edward%20Jenner">Edward Jenner</a> were the first to develop <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a> in the 1930s, when the science of <a href="virology">virology</a> gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of <a href="poliomyelitis">poliomyelitis</a> that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. <a href="HIV">HIV</a> is one of the most <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">transferring genes</a> across species, play important roles in <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s and are essential to life.
Over the past 50,000–100,000 years, as <a href="modern%20humans">modern humans</a> increased in numbers and dispersed throughout the world, new infectious diseases emerged, including those caused by viruses. Earlier, humans lived in small, isolated communities, and most epidemic diseases did not exist. <a href="Smallpox">Smallpox</a>, which is the most lethal and devastating viral infection in history, first emerged among agricultural communities in India about 11,000 years ago. The virus, which only infected humans, probably descended from the <a href="poxviruses">poxviruses</a> of rodents. Humans probably came into contact with these rodents, and some people became infected by the viruses they carried. When viruses cross this so-called "species barrier", their effects can be severe, and humans may have had little <a href="immune%20system">natural resistance</a>. Contemporary humans lived in small communities, and those who succumbed to infection either died or developed immunity. This <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">acquired immunity</a> is only passed down to offspring temporarily, by <a href="antibody">antibodies</a> in breast milk and other antibodies that cross the <a href="placenta">placenta</a> from the mother's blood to the unborn child's. Therefore, sporadic outbreaks probably occurred in each generation. In about 9000 BC, when many people began to settle on the fertile flood plains of the <a href="River%20Nile">River Nile</a>, the population became dense enough for the virus to maintain a constant presence because of the high concentration of susceptible people. Other epidemics of viral diseases that depend on large concentrations of people, such as <a href="mumps">mumps</a>, <a href="rubella">rubella</a> and <a href="polio">polio</a>, also first occurred at this time.

The <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> age, which began in the Middle East in about 9500 BC, was a time when humans became farmers. This agricultural revolution embraced the development of <a href="monoculture">monoculture</a> and presented an opportunity for the rapid spread of several species of <a href="plant%20virus">plant virus</a>es. The divergence and spread of <a href="sobemovirus">sobemovirus</a>es – southern bean mosaic virus – date from this time. The spread of the <a href="potyvirus">potyvirus</a>es of potatoes, and other fruits and vegetables, began about 6,600 years ago.

About 10,000 years ago the humans who inhabited the lands around the <a href="Mediterranean%20basin">Mediterranean basin</a> began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, cats and dogs were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such <a href="zoonosis">zoonotic infection</a>s are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as <a href="influenza">influenza</a>. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.

Other, more ancient, viruses have been less of a threat. <a href="Herpesviridae">Herpes viruses</a> first infected the ancestors of modern humans over 80 million years ago. Humans have developed a tolerance to these viruses, and most are infected with at least one species. Records of these milder virus infections are rare, but it is likely that early hominids suffered from colds, influenza and diarrhoea caused by viruses just as humans do today. More recently evolved viruses cause <a href="epidemic">epidemic</a>s and <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>s – and it is these that history records. The influenza virus is one that seems to have crossed the species barrier from pigs to ducks and water fowl and hence to humans. It is possible that a fatal plague in the Middle East at the time of the late <a href="Eighteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">18th Dynasty</a> was associated with this transmission at <a href="Akhenaten%23Plague%20and%20pandemic">Amarna</a>.

Among the earliest records of a viral infection is an <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian <a href="stele">stele</a> thought to depict an Egyptian priest from the <a href="18th%20Dynasty">18th Dynasty</a> (1580–1350 BC) with a <a href="foot%20drop">foot drop deformity</a> characteristic of a <a href="poliovirus">poliovirus</a> infection. The <a href="mummy">mummy</a> of <a href="Siptah">Siptah</a> – a ruler during the 19th Dynasty – shows signs of <a href="poliomyelitis">poliomyelitis</a>, and that of <a href="Ramesses%20V">Ramesses V</a> and some other Egyptian mummies buried over 3000 years ago show evidence of smallpox. There was an epidemic of smallpox in Athens in 430 BC, in which a quarter of the Athenian army and many of the city's civilians died from the infection.

<a href="Measles">Measles</a> is an old disease, but it was not until the 10th century that the Persian physician <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Zakariya%20al-Razi">Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi</a> (865–925) – known as "Rhazes" – first identified it. Rhazes used the Arabic name "hasbah" for measles. It has had many other names including "rubeola" from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "rubeus", "red", and "morbilli", "small plague". The close similarities between measles virus, <a href="canine%20distemper">canine distemper virus</a> and <a href="rinderpest">rinderpest</a> virus have given rise to speculation that measles was first transmitted to humans from domesticated dogs or cattle. The measles virus appears to have fully diverged from the then-widespread rinderpest virus by the 12th century.

A measles infection confers lifelong immunity. Therefore, the virus requires a high population density to become <a href="endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a>, and this probably did not occur in the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic age</a>. Following the emergence of the virus in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, it reached India by 2500 BC. Measles was so common in children at the time that it was not recognised as a disease. In Egyptian hieroglyphs it was described as a normal stage of human development.
One of the earliest descriptions of a virus-infected plant can be found in a poem written by the Japanese <a href="Empress%20K%C5%8Dken">Empress Kōken</a> (718–770), in which she describes a plant in summer with yellowing leaves. The plant, later identified as "<a href="Eupatorium%20lindleyanum">Eupatorium lindleyanum</a>", is often infected with <a href="tomato%20yellow%20leaf%20curl%20virus">tomato yellow leaf curl virus</a>.

The rapidly growing population of Europe and the rising concentrations of people in its towns and cities became a fertile ground for many infectious and contagious diseases, of which the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> – a bacterial infection – is probably the most notorious. Except for smallpox and influenza, documented outbreaks of infections now known to be caused by viruses were rare. <a href="Rabies">Rabies</a>, a disease that had been recognised for over 4000 years, was rife in Europe, and continued to be so until the development of a vaccine by <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> in 1886. The average life expectancy in Europe during the Middle Ages was 35 years; 60% of children died before the age of 16, many of them during their first 6 years of life. Physicians – what few there were – relied as much on astrology as they did on their limited medical knowledge. Some treatments for infections consisted of ointments prepared from cats that had been roasted in hedgehog fat. Among the plethora of diseases that caused childhood death were measles, influenza and smallpox. The <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a> and the <a href="Muslim%20conquests">Muslim conquests</a> aided the spread of smallpox, which was the cause of frequent epidemics in Europe following its introduction to the continent between the fifth and seventh centuries.

Measles was endemic throughout the highly populated countries of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In England the disease, then called "mezils", was first described in the 13th century, and it was probably one of the 49 plagues that occurred between 526 and 1087.
Rinderpest, which is caused by a virus closely related to measles virus, is a disease of cattle known since Roman times. The disease, which originated in Asia, was first brought to Europe by the invading <a href="Huns">Huns</a> in 370. Later invasions of <a href="Mongol">Mongol</a>s, led by <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a> and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent. At the time rinderpest was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.

A short time after <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry Tudor</a>'s victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth">Battle of Bosworth</a> on 22 August 1485, his army suddenly went down with "the <a href="English%20sweat">English sweat</a>", which contemporary observers described as a new disease. The disease, which was unusual in that it mainly affected the affluent, might have originated in France where Henry VII had recruited soldiers for his army. An epidemic hit London in the hot summer of 1508. Victims died within a day, and there were deaths throughout the city. The streets were deserted apart from carts transporting bodies, and King Henry declared the city off limits except for physicians and apothecaries. The disease spread to Europe, arriving in Hamburg in July 1529 where one to two thousand victims died within the first few weeks. During the following months it wreaked havoc in Prussia, Switzerland, and northern Europe. The last outbreak was in England in 1556. The disease – which killed tens of thousands of people – was probably influenza or a similar viral infection, but records from the time when medicine was not a science can be unreliable. As medicine became a science, the descriptions of disease became less vague. Although medicine could do little at the time to alleviate the suffering of the victims of infection, measures to control the spread of diseases were used. Restrictions on trade and travel were implemented, stricken families were isolated from their communities, buildings were fumigated and livestock killed.

References to influenza infections date from the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but infections almost certainly occurred long before then. In 1173, an epidemic occurred that was possibly the first in Europe, and in 1493, an outbreak of what is now thought to be <a href="swine%20influenza">swine influenza</a>, struck Native Americans in <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>. There is some evidence to suggest that source of the infection was pigs on <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Columbus</a>'s ships. During an influenza epidemic that occurred in England between 1557 and 1559, five per cent of the population – about 150,000 – died from the infection. The mortality rate was nearly five times that of the 1918–19 pandemic. The first pandemic that was reliably recorded began in July 1580 and swept across Europe, Africa, and Asia. The mortality rate was high – 8,000 died in Rome. The next three pandemics occurred in the 18th century, including that during 1781–82, which was probably the most devastating in history. This began in November 1781 in China and reached <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> in December. In February 1782 it hit <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, and by May it had reached Denmark. Within six weeks, 75 per cent of the British population were infected and the pandemic soon spread to the Americas.
The Americas and Australia remained free of measles and smallpox until the arrival of European colonists between the 15th and 18th centuries. Along with measles and influenza, smallpox was taken to the Americas by the Spanish. Smallpox was endemic in Spain, having been introduced by the <a href="Moors">Moors</a> from Africa. In 1519, an epidemic of smallpox broke out in the Aztec capital <a href="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a> in Mexico. This was started by the army of <a href="P%C3%A1nfilo%20de%20Narv%C3%A1ez">Pánfilo de Narváez</a>, who followed <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Cort%C3%A9s">Hernán Cortés</a> from Cuba and had an African slave suffering from smallpox aboard his ship. When the Spanish finally entered the capital in the summer of 1521, they saw it strewn with the bodies of smallpox victims. The epidemic, and those that followed during 1545–1548 and 1576–1581, eventually killed more than half of the native population. Most of the Spanish were immune; with his army of fewer than 900 men it would not have been possible for Cortés to defeat the Aztecs and conquer Mexico without the help of smallpox. Many <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> populations were devastated later by the inadvertent spread of diseases introduced by Europeans. In the 150 years that followed Columbus's arrival in 1492, the Native American population of North America was reduced by 80 per cent from diseases, including measles, smallpox and influenza. The damage done by these viruses significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.

By the 18th century, smallpox was endemic in Europe. There were five epidemics in London between 1719 and 1746, and large outbreaks occurred in other major European cities. By the end of the century about 400,000 Europeans were dying from the disease each year. It reached South Africa in 1713, having been carried by ships from India, and in 1789 the disease struck Australia. In the 19th century, smallpox became the single most important cause of death of the <a href="Australian%20Aborigines">Australian Aborigines</a>.

In 1546 <a href="Girolamo%20Fracastoro">Girolamo Fracastoro</a> (1478–1553) wrote a classic description of measles. He thought the disease was caused by "seeds" ("seminaria") that were spread from person to person. An epidemic hit London in 1670, recorded by <a href="Thomas%20Sydenham">Thomas Sydenham</a> (1624–1689), who thought it was caused by toxic vapours emanating from the earth. His theory was wrong but he was a skilled observer and kept meticulous records.

<a href="Yellow%20fever">Yellow fever</a> is an often lethal disease caused by a <a href="flavivirus">flavivirus</a>. The virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes ("<a href="Aedes%20aegypti">Aedes aegypti</a>") and first appeared over 3,000 years ago. In 1647, the first recorded epidemic occurred on <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> and was called "Barbados distemper" by <a href="John%20Winthrop">John Winthrop</a>, who was the governor of the island at the time. He passed <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> laws to protect the people – the first ever such laws in North America. Further epidemics of the disease occurred in North America in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The first known cases of <a href="dengue%20fever">dengue fever</a> occurred in Indonesia and Egypt in 1779. Trade ships brought the disease to the US, where an epidemic occurred in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in 1780.
Many paintings can be found in the museums of Europe depicting <a href="tulips">tulips</a> with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the <a href="still%20life">still life</a> studies of <a href="Johannes%20Bosschaert">Johannes Bosschaert</a>, were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this <a href="tulip%20mania">tulip mania</a> in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much as a house. It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a <a href="Tulip%20breaking%20virus">virus</a> accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from <a href="jasmine">jasmine</a>. Weakened by the virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants.

Until the Irish <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Great Famine</a> of 1845–1852, the commonest cause of disease in potatoes was not the <a href="Phytophthora%20infestans">mould</a> that causes blight, it was a virus. The disease, called "curl", is caused by <a href="potato%20leafroll%20virus">potato leafroll virus</a>, and it was widespread in England in the 1770s, where it destroyed 75 per cent of the potato crop. At that time, the Irish potato crop remained relatively unscathed.

Lady <a href="Mary%20Wortley%20Montagu">Mary Wortley Montagu</a> (1689–1762) was an aristocrat, a writer and the wife of a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a>. In 1716, her husband, Edward Wortley Montagu, was appointed British Ambassador in Istanbul. She followed him there and two weeks after her arrival discovered the local practice of protection against smallpox by <a href="variolation">variolation</a> – the injection of pus from smallpox victims into the skin. Her younger brother had died of smallpox, and she too had had the disease. Determined to spare her five-year-old son Edward from similar suffering, she ordered the embassy surgeon Charles Maitland to variolate him. On her return to London, she asked Maitland to variolate her four-year-old daughter in the presence of the king's physicians. Later, Montagu persuaded the <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">Prince and Princess of Wales</a> to sponsor a public demonstration of the procedure. Six prisoners who had been condemned to death and were awaiting execution at <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a> were offered a full pardon for serving as the subjects of the public experiment. They accepted and were variolated in 1721. All the prisoners recovered from the procedure. To test its protective effect one of them, a nineteen-year-old woman, was ordered to sleep in the same bed as a ten-year-old smallpox victim for six weeks. She did not contract the disease.

The experiment was repeated on eleven orphan children, all of whom survived the ordeal, and by 1722 even <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George I</a>'s grandchildren had been inoculated. The practice was not entirely safe and there was a one in fifty chance of death. The procedure was expensive; some medical practitioners charged between £5 and £10 and some sold the method to other practitioners for fees between £50 to £100, or for half of the profits. Variolation became a lucrative franchise, but it remained beyond the means of many until the late 1770s. At the time nothing was known about viruses or the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>, and no one knew how the procedure afforded protection.
<a href="Edward%20Jenner">Edward Jenner</a> (1749–1823), a British rural physician, was <a href="wiktionary%3Avariolate">variolated</a> as a boy. He had suffered greatly from the ordeal but survived fully protected from smallpox. Jenner knew of a local belief that dairy workers who had contracted a relatively mild infection called <a href="cowpox">cowpox</a> were immune to smallpox. He decided to test the theory (although he was probably not the first to do so). On 14 May 1796 he selected "a healthy boy, about eight years old for the purpose of inoculation for the Cow Pox". The boy, <a href="James%20Phipps">James Phipps</a> (1788–1853), survived the experimental inoculation with cowpox virus and suffered only a mild fever. On 1 July 1796, Jenner took some "smallpox matter" (probably infected pus) and repeatedly inoculated Phipps's arms with it. Phipps survived and was subsequently inoculated with smallpox more than 20 times without succumbing to the disease. Vaccination – the word is derived from the Latin "vacca" meaning "cow" – had been invented. Jenner's method was soon shown to be safer than variolation, and by 1801 more than 100,000 people had been vaccinated.

Despite objections from those medical practitioners who still practised variolation, and who foresaw a decline in their income, free vaccination of the poor was introduced in the UK in 1840. Because of associated deaths, variolation was declared illegal in the same year. Vaccination was made compulsory in England and Wales by the 1853 <a href="Vaccination%20Act">Vaccination Act</a>, and parents could be fined £1 if their children were not vaccinated before they were three months of age. The law was not adequately enforced, and the system for providing vaccinations, unchanged since 1840, was ineffective. After an early compliance by the population only a small proportion were vaccinated. Compulsory vaccination was not well received and, following protests, the Anti-Vaccination League and the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League were formed in 1866. Following the anti-vaccination campaigns there was a severe outbreak of smallpox in <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> in 1895, the city's first in twenty years; 434 people died, including 281 children. Despite this, the British government conceded to the protesters and the Vaccination Act of 1898 abolished fines and made provision for a "<a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>" clause – the first use of the term – for parents who did not believe in vaccination. During the following year, 250,000 objections were granted, and by 1912 less than half of the population of newborns were being vaccinated. By 1948, smallpox vaccination was no longer compulsory in the UK.

Rabies is an often fatal disease caused by the infection of mammals with <a href="rabies%20virus">rabies virus</a>. In the 21st century it is mainly a disease that affects wild mammals such as foxes and bats, but it is one of the oldest known virus diseases: "rabies" is a <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word ("rabhas") that dates from 3000 BC, which means "madness" or "rage", and the disease has been known for over 4000 years. Descriptions of rabies can be found in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n texts, and the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a> called it "lyssa" or "lytta", meaning "madness". References to rabies can be found in the <a href="Laws%20of%20Eshnunna">Laws of Eshnunna</a>, which date from 2300 BC. <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384–322 BC) wrote one of the earliest undisputed descriptions of the disease and how it was passed to humans. <a href="Celsus">Celsus</a>, in the first century AD, first recorded the symptom called <a href="wikt%3Ahydrophobia">hydrophobia</a> and suggested that the saliva of infected animals and humans contained a slime or poison – to describe this he invented the word "virus". Rabies does not cause epidemics, but the infection was greatly feared because of its terrible symptoms, which include insanity, hydrophobia and death.

In France during the time of Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) there were only a few hundred rabies infections in humans each year, but cures were desperately sought. Aware of the possible danger, Pasteur began to look for the "microbe" in mad dogs. Pasteur showed that when the dried spinal cords from dogs that had died from rabies were crushed and injected into healthy dogs they did not become infected. He repeated the experiment several times on the same dog with tissue that had been dried for fewer and fewer days, until the dog survived even after injections of fresh rabies-infected spinal tissue. Pasteur had immunised the dog against rabies, as he later did with 50 more.
Although Pasteur had little idea how his method worked, he tested it on a boy, <a href="Joseph%20Meister">Joseph Meister</a> (1876–1940), who was brought to Pasteur by his mother on 6 July 1885. He was covered in bites, having been set upon by a mad dog. Meister's mother begged Pasteur to help her son. Pasteur was a scientist, not a physician, and he was well aware of the consequences for him if things were to go wrong. He nevertheless decided to help the boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal tissue over the following 10 days. Later Pasteur wrote, "as the death of this child appeared inevitable, I decided, not without deep and severe unease ... to try out on Joseph Meister the procedure, which had consistently worked on dogs". Meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27 July. Pasteur successfully treated a second boy in October that same year; Jean-Baptiste Jupille (1869–1923) was a 15-year-old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog. Pasteur's method of treatment remained in use for over 50 years.

Little was known about the cause of the disease until 1903 when <a href="Adelchi%20Negri">Adelchi Negri</a> (1876–1912) first saw microscopic lesions – now called <a href="Negri%20bodies">Negri bodies</a> – in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>n parasites. <a href="Paul%20Remlinger">Paul Remlinger</a> (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150 <a href="nanometre">nanometre</a>s long, now known to be the size of <a href="rhabdovirus">rhabdovirus</a> particles – the virus that causes rabies.

At the turn of the 20th century, evidence for the existence of viruses was obtained from experiments with filters that had pores too small for bacteria to pass through; the term "filterable virus" was coined to describe them. Until the 1930s most scientists believed that viruses were small bacteria, but following the invention of the <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a> in 1931 they were shown to be completely different, to a degree that not all scientists were convinced they were anything other than accumulations of toxic <a href="protein">protein</a>s. The situation changed radically when it was discovered that viruses contain genetic material in the form of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> or <a href="RNA">RNA</a>. Once they were recognised as distinct biological entities they were soon shown to be the cause of numerous infections of plants, animals and even bacteria.

Of the many diseases of humans that were found to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one, smallpox, has been eradicated. The diseases caused by viruses such as HIV and influenza virus have proved to be more difficult to control. Other diseases, such as those caused by <a href="arboviruses">arboviruses</a>, are presenting new challenges.

As humans have changed their behaviour during history, so have viruses. In ancient times the human population was too small for pandemics to occur and, in the case of some viruses, too small for them to survive. In the 20th and 21st century increasing population densities, revolutionary changes in agriculture and farming methods, and high speed travel have contributed to the spread of new viruses and the re-appearance of old ones. Like smallpox, some viral diseases might be conquered, but new ones, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (<a href="SARS">SARS</a>), will continue to emerge. Although vaccines are still the most powerful weapon against viruses, in recent decades <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s have been developed to specifically target viruses as they replicate in their <a href="host%20%28biology%29">hosts</a>. The <a href="2009%20flu%20pandemic">2009 influenza pandemic</a> showed how rapidly new <a href="Strain%20%28biology%29">strains</a> of viruses continue to spread around the world, despite efforts to contain them.

Advances in virus discovery and control continue to be made. <a href="Human%20metapneumovirus">Human metapneumovirus</a>, which is a cause of respiratory infections including <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, was discovered in 2001. A vaccine for the <a href="papillomavirus">papillomavirus</a>es that cause <a href="cervical%20cancer">cervical cancer</a> was developed between 2002 and 2006. In 2005, <a href="human%20T-lymphotropic%20virus">human T lymphotropic viruses 3 and 4</a> were discovered. In 2008 the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative was re-launched with a plan to <a href="Poliomyelitis%20eradication">eradicate poliomyelitis</a> by 2015. In 2010, the largest virus, <a href="Megavirus">Megavirus chilensis</a> was discovered to infect <a href="Amoeboid">amoebae</a>. These giant viruses have renewed interest in the role viruses play in evolution and their position in the <a href="tree%20of%20life%23Science">tree of life</a>.

Smallpox virus was a major cause of death in the 20th century, killing about 300 million people. It has probably killed more humans than any other virus. In 1966 an agreement was reached by the <a href="World%20Health%20Assembly">World Health Assembly</a> (the decision-making body of the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>) to start an "intensified smallpox eradication programme" and attempt to <a href="Eradication%20of%20infectious%20diseases">eradicate</a> the disease within ten years. At the time, smallpox was still endemic in 31 countries including Brazil, the whole of the Indian sub-continent, Indonesia and sub-Saharan Africa. This ambitious goal was considered achievable for several reasons: the vaccine afforded exceptional protection; there was only one type of the virus; there were no animals that naturally carried it; the <a href="incubation%20period">incubation period</a> of the infection was known and rarely varied from 12 days; and infections always gave rise to symptoms, so it was clear who had the disease.

Following mass vaccinations, disease detection and containment were central to the eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> and <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated <a href="disease%20surveillance">disease surveillance</a> and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was <a href="vaccinia%20virus">vaccinia virus</a>, which was used as the vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.

The eradication campaign led to the death of <a href="Janet%20Parker">Janet Parker</a> (c. 1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a> who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.

Before the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> on the United States in 2001, the World Health Organization proposed the destruction of all the known remaining stocks of smallpox virus that were kept in laboratories in the US and Russia. Fears of <a href="bioterrorism">bioterrorism</a> using smallpox virus and the possible need for the virus in the development of drugs to treat the infection have put an end to this plan. Had the destruction gone ahead, smallpox virus might have been the first to be made extinct by human intervention.

Before the introduction of vaccination in the US in the 1960s there were more than 500,000 cases each year resulting in about 400 deaths. In developed countries children were mainly infected between the ages of three and five years old, but in developing countries half the children were infected before the age of two. In the US and the UK, there were regular annual or biannual epidemics of the disease, which depended on the number of children born each year. The current epidemic strain evolved in the first part of the 20th century – probably between 1908 and 1943.

In London between 1950 and 1968 there were epidemics every two years, but in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, which had a higher birth rate, there was an annual cycle of epidemics. During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> in the US before the Second World War the birth rate was low, and epidemics of measles were sporadic. After the war the birth rate increased, and epidemics occurred regularly every two years. In developing countries with very high birth rates, epidemics occurred every year. Measles is still a major problem in densely populated, less-developed countries with high birth rates and lacking effective vaccination campaigns.

By the mid-1970s, following a mass vaccination programme that was known as "make measles a memory", the incidence of measles in the US had fallen by 90 per cent. Similar vaccination campaigns in other countries have reduced the levels of infection by 99 per cent over the past 50 years. Susceptible individuals remain a source of infection and include those who have migrated from countries with ineffective vaccination schedules, or who refuse the vaccine or choose not to have their children vaccinated.
Humans are the only natural host of measles virus. Immunity to the disease following an infection is lifelong; that afforded by vaccination is long term but eventually wanes.

The use of the vaccine has been <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">controversial</a>. In 1998, <a href="Andrew%20Wakefield">Andrew Wakefield</a> and his colleagues published a fraudulent research paper and he claimed to link the <a href="MMR%20vaccine">MMR vaccine</a> with <a href="autism">autism</a>. The study was widely reported and fed concern about the safety of vaccinations. Wakefield's research was identified as fraudulent and in 2010, he was struck off the UK medical register and can no longer practise medicine in the UK. In the wake of the controversy, the MMR vaccination rate in the UK fell from 92 per cent in 1995, to less than 80 per cent in 2003. Cases of measles rose from 56 in 1998 to 1370 in 2008, and similar increases occurred throughout Europe. In April 2013, an epidemic of measles in <a href="Wales">Wales</a> in the UK broke out, which mainly affected teenagers who had not been vaccinated. Despite this controversy, measles has been eliminated from Finland, Sweden and Cuba. Japan abolished mandatory vaccination in 1992, and in 1995–1997 more than 200,000 cases were reported in the country. Measles remains a <a href="public%20health">public health</a> problem in Japan, where it is now endemic; a National Measles Elimination Plan was established in December 2007, with a view to eliminating the disease from the country. The possibility of global elimination of measles has been debated in medical literature since the introduction of the vaccine in the 1960s. Should the current campaign to eradicate poliomyelitis be successful, it is likely that the debate will be renewed.

During the summers of the mid-20th century, parents in the US and Europe dreaded the annual appearance of poliomyelitis (or polio), which was commonly known as "infantile paralysis". The disease was rare at the beginning of the century, and worldwide there were only a few thousand cases per year, but by the 1950s there were 60,000 cases each year in the US alone and an average of 2,300 in England and Wales.

During 1916 and 1917 there had been a major epidemic in the US; 27,000 cases and 6,000 deaths were recorded, with 9,000 cases in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. At the time nobody knew how the virus was spreading. Many of the city's inhabitants, including scientists, thought that impoverished slum-dwelling immigrants were to blame even though the prevalence of the disease was higher in the more prosperous districts such as <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a> – a pattern that had also been seen in cities like Philadelphia. Many other industrialised countries were affected at the same time. In particular, before the outbreaks in the US, large epidemics had occurred in Sweden.

The reason for the rise of polio in industrialised countries in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease is caused by a virus that is passed from person to person by the <a href="faecal-oral%20route">faecal-oral route</a>, and naturally infects only humans. It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence. Although the virus was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild. During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.

Following the development of vaccines in the mid-1950s, mass vaccination campaigns took place in many countries. In the US, after a campaign promoted by the <a href="March%20of%20Dimes">March of Dimes</a>, the annual number of polio cases fell dramatically; the last outbreak was in 1979. In 1988 the World Health Organization along with others launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and by 1994 the Americas were declared to be free of disease, followed by the Pacific region in 2000 and Europe in 2003. At the end of 2012, only 223 cases were reported by the World Health Organization. Mainly poliovirus type 1 infections, 122 occurred in <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, one in <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, 58 in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and 37 in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Vaccination teams often face danger; seven vaccinators were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria at the beginning of 2013. In Pakistan, the campaign was further hampered by the murder on 26 February 2013 of a police officer who was providing security.

The human immunodeficiency virus (<a href="HIV">HIV</a>) is the virus that – when the infection is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.
<a href="HIV-1">HIV-1</a> is one of the most significant viruses to have emerged in the last quarter of the 20th century. When, in 1981, a scientific article was published that reported the deaths of five young gay men, no one knew that they had died from AIDS. The full scale of the epidemic – and that the virus had been silently emerging over several decades – was not known.

HIV crossed the species barrier between chimpanzees and humans in Africa in the early decades of the 20th century. During the years that followed there were enormous social changes and turmoil in Africa. Population shifts were unprecedented as vast numbers of people moved from rural farms to the expanding cities, and the virus was spread from remote regions to densely populated urban conurbations. The incubation period for AIDS is around 10 years, so a global epidemic starting in the early 1980s is credible. At this time there was much scapegoating and stigmatisation. The "out of Africa" theory for the origin of the HIV pandemic was not well received by Africans, who felt that the "blame" was misplaced. This led the World Health Assembly to pass a 1987 resolution, which stated that HIV is "a naturally occurring [virus] of undetermined geographic origin".

The HIV pandemic has challenged communities and brought about social changes throughout the world. Opinions on sexuality are more openly discussed. Advice on sexual practices and drug use – which were once taboo – is sponsored by many governments and their healthcare providers. Debates on the ethics of provision and cost of <a href="Management%20of%20HIV/AIDS">anti-retroviral drugs</a>, particularly in poorer countries, have highlighted inequalities in healthcare and stimulated far-reaching legislative changes. In developing countries the impact of HIV/AIDS has been profound; key organisations such as healthcare, defense and civil services have been severely disrupted. Life expectancy has fallen. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy was 79 years in 1991 but by 2001 it had fallen to 39 years.

When influenza virus undergoes a <a href="genetic%20shift">genetic shift</a> many humans have no immunity to the new strain, and if the population of susceptible individuals is high enough to maintain the chain of infection, pandemics occur. The genetic changes usually happen when different strains of the virus co-infect animals, particularly birds and swine. Although many viruses of <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s are restricted to one species, influenza virus is an exception. The last pandemic of the 19th century occurred in 1899 and resulted in the deaths of 250,000 people in Europe. The virus, which originated in Russia or Asia, was the first to be rapidly spread by people on trains and steamships.

A new strain of the virus emerged in 1918, and the subsequent pandemic of <a href="Spanish%20flu">Spanish flu</a> was one of the worst natural disasters in history. The death toll was enormous; throughout the world around 50 million people died from the infection. There were 550,000 reported deaths caused by the disease in the US, ten times the country's losses during the First World War, and 228,000 deaths in the UK. In India there were more than 20 million deaths, and in <a href="Western%20Samoa">Western Samoa</a> 22 per cent of the population died. Although cases of influenza occurred every winter, there were only two other pandemics in the 20th century.

In 1957 another new strain of the virus emerged and caused a pandemic of <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H2N2">Asian flu</a>; although the virus was not as <a href="Virulence">virulent</a> as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when <a href="Hong%20Kong%20flu">Hong Kong flu</a> emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain. Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic was the least severe, but 33,800 were killed in the US. New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.

The most recent pandemic occurred in 2009, but none of the last three has caused anything near the devastation seen in 1918. Exactly why the strain of influenza that emerged in 1918 was so devastating is a question that still remains unanswered.

Arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted to humans and other vertebrates by blood-sucking insects. These viruses are diverse; the term "arbovirus" – which was derived from "arthropod-borne virus" – is no longer used in formal <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> because many species of virus are known to be spread in this way. There are more than 500 species of arboviruses, but in the 1930s only three were known to cause disease in humans: <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever virus</a>, <a href="dengue%20virus">dengue virus</a> and <a href="Pappataci%20fever">Pappataci fever virus</a>. More than 100 of such viruses are now known to cause human diseases including <a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a>.

Yellow fever is the most notorious disease caused by a flavivirus. The last major epidemic in the US occurred in 1905. During the building of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> thousands of workers died from the disease. Yellow fever originated in Africa and the virus was brought to the Americas on cargo ships, which were harbouring the "Aedes aegypti" mosquito that carries the virus. The first recorded epidemic in Africa occurred in <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, in West Africa, in 1926. In the 1930s the disease re-emerged in Brazil. <a href="Fred%20Soper">Fred Soper</a>, an American <a href="epidemiologist">epidemiologist</a> (1893–1977), discovered the importance of the <a href="sylvatic%20cycle">sylvatic cycle</a> of infection in non-human hosts, and that infection of humans was a "dead end" that broke this cycle. Although the yellow fever vaccine is one of the most successful ever developed, epidemics continue to occur. In 1986–91 in West Africa, over 20,000 people were infected, 4,000 of whom died.

In the 1930s, <a href="St.%20Louis%20encephalitis">St. Louis encephalitis</a>, <a href="eastern%20equine%20encephalitis">eastern equine encephalitis</a> and <a href="western%20equine%20encephalitis">western equine encephalitis</a> emerged in the US. The virus that causes <a href="La%20Crosse%20encephalitis">La Crosse encephalitis</a> was discovered in the 1960s, and <a href="West%20Nile%20virus">West Nile virus</a> arrived in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> in 1999. As of 2010, dengue virus is the most prevalent arbovirus and increasingly virulent strains of the virus have spread across Asia and the Americas.

<a href="Hepatitis">Hepatitis</a> is a disease of the liver that has been recognised since antiquity. Symptoms include <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a>, a yellowing of the skin, eyes and body fluids. There are numerous causes, including viruses – particularly <a href="hepatitis%20A%20virus">hepatitis A virus</a>, <a href="hepatitis%20B%20virus">hepatitis B virus</a> and <a href="hepatitis%20C%20virus">hepatitis C virus</a>. Throughout history epidemics of jaundice have been reported, mainly affecting soldiers at war. This "campaign jaundice" was common in the Middle Ages. It occurred among <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s armies and during most of the major conflicts of the 19th and 20th centuries, including the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, where over 40,000 cases and around 150 deaths were reported. The viruses that cause epidemic jaundice were not discovered until the middle of the 20th century. The names for epidemic jaundice, hepatitis A, and for blood-borne infectious jaundice, hepatitis B, were first used in 1947, following a publication in 1946 giving evidence that the two diseases were distinct. In the 1960s, the first virus that could cause hepatitis was discovered. This was hepatitis B virus, which was named after the disease it causes. Hepatitis A virus was discovered in 1974.
The discovery of hepatitis B virus and the invention of tests to detect it have radically changed many medical, and some cosmetic procedures. The screening of <a href="Blood%20donation">donated blood</a>, which was introduced in the early 1970s, has dramatically reduced the transmission of the virus. Donations of human <a href="blood%20plasma">blood plasma</a> and <a href="Factor%20VIII">Factor VIII</a> collected before 1975 often contained infectious levels of hepatitis B virus. Until the late 1960s, <a href="hypodermic%20needle">hypodermic needle</a>s were often reused by medical professionals, and tattoo artists' needles were a common source of infection. In the late 1990s, <a href="needle%20exchange%20programme">needle exchange programme</a>s were established in Europe and the US to prevent the spread of infections by <a href="Recreational%20drug%20use">intravenous drug users</a>. These measures also helped to reduce the subsequent impact of HIV and hepatitis C virus.

Epizootics are outbreaks (epidemics) of disease among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included <a href="foot-and-mouth%20disease">foot-and-mouth disease</a>, rinderpest of cattle, <a href="avian%20influenza">avian</a> and swine influenza, <a href="swine%20fever">swine fever</a> and <a href="bluetongue">bluetongue</a> of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock can be devastating both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.

First appearing in East Africa in 1891, rinderpest, a disease of cattle, spread rapidly across Africa. By 1892, 95 per cent of the cattle in East Africa had died. This resulted in a famine that devastated the farmers and nomadic people, some of whom were entirely dependent on their cattle. Two thirds of the population of <a href="Maasai%20people">Maasai people</a> died. The situation was made worse by epidemics of smallpox that followed in the wake of the famine. In the early years of the 20th century rinderpest was common in Asia and parts of Europe. The prevalence of the disease was steadily reduced during the century by control measures that included vaccination. By 1908 Europe was free from the disease. Outbreaks did occur following the Second World War, but these were quickly controlled. The prevalence of the disease increased in Asia, and in 1957 <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> had to appeal for aid because so many buffaloes had died that the <a href="paddy%20field">paddy field</a>s could not be prepared for rice growing. Russia west of the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> remained free from the disease – <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Lenin</a> approved several laws on the control of the disease – but cattle in eastern Russia were constantly infected with rinderpest that originated in Mongolia and China where the prevalence remained high. India controlled the spread of the disease, which had retained a foothold in the southern states of <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> and <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>, throughout the 20th century, and had eradicated the disease by 1995. Africa suffered two major <a href="panzootic">panzootic</a>s in the 1920s and 1980s. There was a severe outbreak in <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a> in 1928 and the disease was widespread in the country until 1953. In the 1980s, outbreaks in <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> and <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> were controlled by the use of 26 million doses of vaccine, and a recurrence of the disease in 1997 was suppressed by an intensive vaccination campaign. By the end of the century rinderpest had been eradicated from most countries. A few pockets of infection remained in Ethiopia and Sudan, and in 1994 the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was launched by the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO) with the aim of global eradication by 2010. In May 2011, the FAO and the <a href="World%20Organisation%20for%20Animal%20Health">World Organisation for Animal Health</a> announced that "rinderpest as a freely circulating viral disease has been eliminated from the world."

Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious infection caused by an <a href="aphthovirus">aphthovirus</a>, and is classified in the same family as poliovirus. The virus has infected animals, mainly <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s, in Africa since ancient times and was probably brought to the Americas in the 19th century by imported livestock. Foot-and-mouth disease is rarely fatal, but the economic losses incurred by outbreaks in sheep and cattle herds can be high. The last occurrence of the disease in the US was in 1929, but as recently as 2001, several large <a href="2001%20United%20Kingdom%20foot-and-mouth%20outbreak">outbreaks</a> occurred throughout the UK and thousands of animals were killed and burnt.

The natural hosts of influenza viruses are pigs and birds, although it has probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.

In the early years of the 21st century epizootics in livestock caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences. <a href="Bluetongue%20disease">Bluetongue disease</a>, a disease caused by an <a href="orbivirus">orbivirus</a> broke out in sheep in France in 2007. Until then the disease had been mainly confined to the Americas, Africa, southern Asia and northern Australia, but it is now an emerging disease around the Mediterranean.

During the 20th century, many "old" diseases of plants were found to be caused by viruses. These included <a href="maize%20streak">maize streak</a> and <a href="cassava%20mosaic%20virus">cassava mosaic disease</a>.
As with humans, when plants thrive in close proximity, so do their viruses. This can cause huge economic losses and human tragedies. In <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> during the 1970s, where tomatoes and <a href="cucurbitaceae">cucurbits</a> (cucumbers, melons and gourds) were extensively grown, entire fields were infected with viruses. Similarly, in <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Côte d'Ivoire</a>, thirty different viruses infected crops such as <a href="legumes">legumes</a> and vegetables. In Kenya cassava mosaic virus, maize streak virus and groundnut viral diseases caused the loss of up to 70 per cent of the crop.
<a href="Cassava">Cassava</a> is the most abundant crop that is grown in eastern Africa and it is a staple crop for more than 200 million people. It was introduced to Africa from South America and grows well in soils with poor fertility. The most important disease of cassava is caused by cassava mosaic virus, a <a href="geminiviridae">geminivirus</a>, which is transmitted between plants by <a href="whitefly">whiteflies</a>. The disease was first recorded in 1894 and outbreaks of the disease occurred in eastern Africa throughout the 20th century, often resulting in famine.

In the 1920s the <a href="sugarbeet">sugarbeet</a> growers in the western US suffered huge economic loss caused by damage done to their crops by the <a href="leafhopper">leafhopper</a>-transmitted <a href="beet%20curly%20top%20virus">beet curly top virus</a>. In 1956, between 25 and 50 per cent of the rice crop in Cuba and Venezuela was destroyed by <a href="rice%20hoja%20blanca%20virus">rice hoja blanca virus</a>. In 1958, it caused the loss of many rice fields in Colombia. Outbreaks recurred in 1981, which caused losses of up to 100 per cent. In Ghana between 1936 and 1977, the mealybug-transmitted <a href="cacao%20swollen-shoot%20virus">cacao swollen-shoot virus</a> caused the loss of 162 million <a href="Theobroma%20cacao">cacao trees</a>, and additional trees were lost at the rate of 15 million each year. In 1948, in <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, US, seven per cent of the wheat crop was destroyed by <a href="wheat%20streak%20mosaic%20virus">wheat streak mosaic virus</a>, spread by the <a href="Aceria">wheat curl mite</a> "(Aceria tulipae)". In the 1950s <a href="papaya%20ringspot%20virus">papaya ringspot virus</a> – a <a href="potyvirus">potyvirus</a> – caused a devastating loss of <a href="papaya">solo papaya</a> crops on <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, Hawaii. Solo papaya had been introduced to the island in the previous century but the disease had not been seen on the island before the 1940s.

Such disasters occurred when human intervention caused ecological changes by the introduction of crops to new <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a>s and viruses. Cacao is native to South America and was introduced to West Africa in the late 19th century. In 1936, swollen root disease had been transmitted to plantations by mealybugs from indigenous trees. New habitats can trigger outbreaks of plant virus diseases. Before 1970, the <a href="rice%20yellow%20mottle%20virus">rice yellow mottle virus</a> was only found in the <a href="Kisumu">Kisumu</a> district of Kenya, but following the irrigation of large areas of East Africa and extensive rice cultivation, the virus spread throughout East Africa. Human activity introduced plant viruses to native crops. The <a href="citrus%20tristeza%20virus">citrus tristeza virus</a> (CTV) was introduced to South America from Africa between 1926 and 1930. At the same time, the aphid "<a href="Toxoptera%20citricida">Toxoptera citricidus</a>" was carried from Asia to South America and this accelerated the transmission of the virus. By 1950, more than six million citrus trees had been killed by the virus in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, Brazil. CTV and citrus trees probably <a href="Coevolution">coevolved</a> for centuries in their original countries. The dispersal of CTV to other regions and its interaction with new citrus varieties resulted in devastating outbreaks of plant diseases. Because of the problems caused by the introduction – by humans – of plant viruses, many countries have strict importation controls on any materials that can harbour dangerous plant viruses or their insect vectors.

Emerging viruses are those that have only relatively recently infected the host species. In humans, many emerging viruses have come from other animals. When viruses jump to other species the diseases caused in humans are called "<a href="zoonoses">zoonoses</a>" or "zoonotic infections".

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a new type of <a href="coronavirus">coronavirus</a>. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.

West Nile virus, a flavivirus, was first identified in 1937 when it was found in the blood of a feverish woman. The virus, which is carried by mosquitoes and birds, caused outbreaks of infection in North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s and by the 1960s horses in Europe fell victim. The largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a>, South Africa and 10,000 people became ill. An increasing frequency of epidemics and epizootics (in horses) began in 1996, around the Mediterranean basin, and by 1999 the virus had reached New York City. Since then the virus has spread throughout the US. In the US, mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in late summer, and the number of cases of the disease increases in mid July to early September. When the weather becomes colder, the mosquitoes die and the risk of disease decreases. In Europe, many outbreaks have occurred; in 2000 a surveillance programme began in the UK to monitor the incidence of the virus in humans, dead birds, mosquitoes and horses. The mosquito "(<a href="Culex%20modestus">Culex modestus</a>)" that can carry the virus breeds on the marshes of north <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. This mosquito species was not previously thought to be present in the UK, but it is widespread in southern Europe where it carries West Nile virus.

In 1997 an outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new <a href="Paramyxoviridae">paramyxovirus</a> was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named <a href="Nipah%20virus">Nipah virus</a>, after the village where he had lived. The infection was caused by a virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.

Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the "<a href="Filoviridae">Filoviridae</a>". Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause <a href="viral%20hemorrhagic%20fever">viral haemorrhagic fever</a>, and include the <a href="Ebola">Ebola</a> and <a href="Marburg%20virus">Marburg virus</a>es. The Marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 after an outbreak in <a href="Angola">Angola</a>. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, there were 252 cases including 227 deaths.

The <a href="Ebola%20virus%20epidemic%20in%20West%20Africa">Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa</a>, which began in 2013, is the most devastating since the emergence of HIV. The initial outbreak occurred in December 2013 in Meliandou, a village in southern <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>. Among the first victims were a two-year-old boy, his three-year-old sister, their mother and grandmother. After the grandmother's funeral, which was attended by her family and caregivers, the disease spread to neighbouring villages. By March 2014 the outbreak was severe enough to raise the concern of local health officials who reported it to the Guinean Ministry of Health. By the middle of the year the epidemic had spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. As of June 2015, the World Health Organization reported over 27,000 cases of the disease, which had resulted in more than 11,000 deaths.

The natural source of Ebola virus is probably bats. Marburg viruses are transmitted to humans by monkeys, and <a href="Lassa%20fever">Lassa fever</a> by rats ("<a href="Natal%20multimammate%20mouse">Mastomys natalensis</a>"). Zoonotic infections can be severe because humans often have no natural resistance to the infection and it is only when viruses become well-adapted to new host that their virulence decreases. Some zoonotic infections are often "dead ends", in that after the initial outbreak the rate of subsequent infections subsides because the viruses are not efficient at spreading from person to person.

The beginning of the 21st century saw an increase in the global awareness of devastating epidemics in developing countries, which, in previous decades had passed relatively unnoticed by the international health community.

Sir <a href="Peter%20Medawar">Peter Medawar</a> (1915–1987) described a virus as "a piece of bad news wrapped in a protein coat". With the exception of the <a href="bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a>s, viruses had a well-deserved reputation for being nothing but the cause of diseases and death. The discovery of the abundance of viruses and their overwhelming presence in many ecosystems has led modern virologists to reconsider their role in the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a>.

It is estimated that there are about 10 viruses on Earth. Most of them are bacteriophages, and most are in the oceans. Microorganisms constitute more than 90 per cent of the biomass in the sea, and it has been estimated that viruses kill approximately 20 per cent of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and <a href="archaea">archaea</a>. Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s, which often kill other marine life, and help maintain the ecological balance of different species of marine <a href="cyanobacteria">blue-green algae</a>, and thus adequate <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> production for life on Earth.

The emergence of strains of bacteria that are resistant to a broad range of antibiotics has become a problem in the treatment of bacterial infections. Only two new classes of antibiotics have been developed in the past 30 years, and novel ways of combating bacterial infections are being sought. Bacteriophages were first used to control bacteria in the 1920s, and a large clinical trial was conducted by Soviet scientists in 1963. This work was unknown outside the Soviet Union until the results of the trial were published in the West in 1989. The recent and escalating problems caused by <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">antibiotic-resistant bacteria</a> has stimulated a renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages and <a href="phage%20therapy">phage therapy</a>.

The <a href="Human%20Genome%20Project">Human Genome Project</a> has revealed the presence of numerous viral DNA sequences scattered throughout the <a href="human%20genome">human genome</a>. These sequences make up around eight per cent of human DNA, and appear to be the remains of ancient <a href="retrovirus">retrovirus</a> infections of human ancestors. These pieces of DNA have firmly established themselves in human DNA. Most of this DNA is no longer functional, but some of these friendly viruses have brought with them novel <a href="gene">gene</a>s that are important in human development. Viruses have transferred important genes to plants. About ten per cent of all <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> uses the products of genes that have been transferred to plants from blue-green algae by viruses.

Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway

The <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a> (L&M) opened on 15 September 1830. Work on the L&M had begun in the 1820s, to connect the major industrial city of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> with the nearest <a href="deep%20water%20port">deep water port</a> at the <a href="Port%20of%20Liverpool">Port of Liverpool</a>, away. Although horse-drawn railways already existed elsewhere, and a few industrial sites already used primitive steam locomotives for bulk haulage, the L&M was the first locomotive-hauled railway to connect two major cities, and the first to provide a scheduled passenger service. The opening day was a major public event. <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington</a>, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, rode on one of the eight inaugural trains, as did many other dignitaries and notable figures of the day. Huge crowds lined the track at <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> to watch the trains depart for Manchester.

The trains left Liverpool on time and without any technical problems. The Duke of Wellington's special train ran on one track, and the other seven trains ran on an adjacent and parallel track, sometimes ahead and sometimes behind the Duke's train. Around out of Liverpool the first of many problems occurred, when one of the trains derailed and the following train collided with it. With no reported injuries or damage, the derailed locomotive was lifted back onto the track and the journey continued. At <a href="Parkside%20railway%20station%20%28Merseyside%29">Parkside railway station</a>, near the midpoint of the line, the locomotives made a scheduled stop to take on water. Although the railway staff advised passengers to remain on the trains while this took place, around 50 of the dignitaries on board alighted when the Duke of Wellington's special train stopped. One of those who got off was <a href="William%20Huskisson">William Huskisson</a>, former cabinet minister and <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Liverpool%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Liverpool</a>. Huskisson had been a highly influential figure in the creation of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and an architect of the doctrine of <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>, but had fallen out with Wellington in 1828 over the issue of parliamentary reform and had resigned from the cabinet. Hoping to be reconciled with Wellington, he approached the Duke's railway carriage and shook his hand. Distracted by the Duke, he did not notice an approaching locomotive on the adjacent track, "<a href="Stephenson%27s%20Rocket">Rocket</a>". On realising it was approaching he panicked and tried to clamber into the Duke's carriage, but the door of the carriage swung open leaving him hanging directly in the path of the oncoming "Rocket". He fell onto the tracks in front of the train, suffering serious leg injuries and dying later that night.

The Duke of Wellington felt that the remainder of the day's events should be cancelled following the accident at Parkside, and proposed to return to Liverpool. However, a large crowd had gathered in Manchester to see the trains arrive, and was beginning to become unruly. Wellington was persuaded to continue to Manchester. By the time the trains reached the outskirts of Manchester the crowd had become hostile and was spilling onto the tracks. With local authorities unable to clear the tracks, the trains were obliged to drive at low speed into the crowd, using their own momentum to push people out of the way. Eventually they arrived at <a href="Liverpool%20Road%20railway%20station%20%28Manchester%29">Liverpool Road railway station</a> in Manchester to be met by a hostile crowd, who waved banners and flags against the Duke and pelted him with vegetables. Wellington refused to get off the train, and ordered that the trains return to Liverpool. Mechanical failures and an inability to turn the locomotives meant that most of the trains were unable to leave Manchester. While the Duke of Wellington's train left successfully, only three of the remaining seven locomotives were usable. These three locomotives slowly hauled a single long train of 24 carriages back to Liverpool, eventually arriving 6 hours late after having been pelted with objects thrown from bridges by the drunken crowds lining the track.

The death and funeral of William Huskisson caused the opening of the railway to be widely reported, and people around the world became aware that cheap and rapid long-distance transport was now possible for the first time. The L&M became extremely successful, and within a month of its opening plans were put forward to connect Liverpool and Manchester with the other major cities of England. Within ten years, of railways were built in Britain, and within 20 years of the L&M's opening over were in place. The L&M remains in operation, and its opening is now considered the start of the age of mechanised transport; in the words of industrialist and former <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> chairman <a href="Peter%20Parker%20%28British%20businessman%29">Peter Parker</a>, "the world is a branch line of the pioneering Liverpool–Manchester run".

The <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway%20Company">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a> (L&M) was founded on 24 May 1823 by <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> merchants <a href="Joseph%20Sandars">Joseph Sandars</a> and <a href="Henry%20Booth">Henry Booth</a>, with the aim of linking the textile mills of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> to the nearest <a href="deep%20water%20port">deep water port</a> at the <a href="Port%20of%20Liverpool">Port of Liverpool</a>. At the time, the only means of bulk transport between the two towns other than animal-drawn carts was water transport on the <a href="Mersey%20and%20Irwell%20Navigation">Mersey and Irwell Navigation</a>, the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> and the <a href="Leeds%20and%20Liverpool%20Canal">Leeds and Liverpool Canal</a>, all of which were slow and expensive to use; transporting raw cotton the from Liverpool to Manchester was as expensive as the initial cost of shipping it from America to Liverpool. Although horse and human powered railways had existed for centuries, and steam power was beginning to be used in some experimental industrial railways, the L&M was to be the first steam powered railway to provide an inter-city passenger service, and the most expensive engineering project yet undertaken in Britain. (Because much of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway ran over land owned by investors in the company, and because many of the early locomotives were owned by the engineering firms which built them rather than by the L&M, it is impossible to give a precise figure for the L&M's construction costs. The direct construction cost of the line up to its opening was around £820,000, and the two years of lobbying necessary to get the railway authorised is estimated to have cost £70,000. In comparison, the Bridgewater Canal, which had the same purpose as the L&M in connecting Manchester to the Port of Liverpool, had cost an estimated £220,000 to build in the late 18th century. The average labourer's wage in the area at this time was around £20 per year.)

The <a href="George%20Leveson-Gower%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Sutherland">Marquess of Stafford</a>, owner of the Bridgewater Canal, was a friend of Liverpool's <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> <a href="William%20Huskisson">William Huskisson</a>, with whom he had worked at the British Embassy in Paris. Although the Marquess had initially feared the potential impact of railways on the income from his canal and had been strongly opposed to the railway, Huskisson persuaded him to allow the railway to use his lands and to invest in the scheme.

In 1826 <a href="George%20Stephenson">George Stephenson</a> was appointed to design and build the route. Stephenson built the line using four equally spaced rails; he envisaged that this would allow the line to operate as a double tracked railway line under normal circumstances, but that in the event of a locomotive needing to haul a particularly wide load or of one of the outside rails breaking, a train could run along the central pair of rails. He also felt that, by having the rails this close together, it would reduce the amount of land required for the already extremely expensive L&M scheme.

William Huskisson was born at <a href="Birtsmorton%20Court">Birtsmorton Court</a>, <a href="Malvern%2C%20Worcestershire">Malvern</a>, <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, on 11 March 1770. In 1783, Huskisson went to Paris to live with his great-uncle Dr. Richard Gem, witnessing the early years of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, and was present at the <a href="Storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">Storming of the Bastille</a>. Learning economics from the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Condorcet">Marquis de Condorcet</a>, he became an assistant to Earl Gower, who would later become the Marquess of Stafford. In 1792 Britain severed diplomatic relations with the French revolutionary government and Huskisson returned to London.

On Huskisson's return to London <a href="Henry%20Dundas%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Melville">Henry Dundas</a>, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, appointed him to oversee the execution of the <a href="Aliens%20Act%201793">Aliens Act</a>, which dealt with refugees arriving in Britain from areas affected by the French Revolution. He performed this task well, and in 1795 he was appointed <a href="Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Under-Secretary of State for War</a> at the age of 24. In 1796 he was elected <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for <a href="Morpeth%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Morpeth</a>. In 1799 he married Eliza Emily Milbanke (known as Emily), daughter of Admiral <a href="Mark%20Milbanke">Mark Milbanke</a>, and shortly afterwards moved to <a href="Eartham%20House">Eartham House</a> near <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a>. He resigned from public office in 1801 following the fall of <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt the Younger</a>'s government. In 1804 he was re-elected to Parliament for <a href="Liskeard%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Liskeard</a>, and appointed to the post of <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20Treasury">Secretary to the Treasury</a> by the returning Pitt. In 1809 Huskisson resigned from the government along with <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a> following Canning's <a href="George%20Canning%23Duel%20with%20Castlereagh">duel</a> with fellow cabinet minister <a href="Robert%20Stewart%2C%20Viscount%20Castlereagh">Lord Castlereagh</a>. In 1814 he re-entered public life as <a href="First%20Commissioner%20of%20Woods%20and%20Forests">First Commissioner of Woods and Forests</a>; although this was a relatively minor post, he was very influential in the development of detailed legislation and policy, particularly regarding the controversial relaxation of the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a>.
In 1823 Huskisson was appointed to the Cabinet as <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a> and <a href="Treasurer%20of%20the%20Navy">Treasurer of the Navy</a>. In the same year he succeeded George Canning in the important constituency of <a href="Liverpool%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Liverpool</a>. He oversaw a number of reforms aimed at developing industry and free trade, including reform of the <a href="Navigation%20Acts">Navigation Acts</a> and reduction of taxes on manufacturing and on the import of foreign goods. He drove through the restructuring of Britain's network of overseas outposts and colonies into the network of economically and politically interdependent states which became the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, aiming for a gradual abolition of slavery and accelerating British colonisation.

In April 1827 Huskisson's mentor George Canning became <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, but died less than four months later and was succeeded by <a href="F.%20J.%20Robinson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Goderich">Viscount Goderich</a>. Goderich appointed Huskisson <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War%20and%20the%20Colonies">Secretary of State for War and the Colonies</a>. Goderich resigned in January 1828 and was replaced as Prime Minister by <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington</a>. Huskisson, along with many other protégés of Canning, resigned later that year over the issue of the lack of parliamentary representation for Manchester. Huskisson remained in Parliament as MP for Liverpool, and devoted himself to working on behalf of the growing industrial towns of north west England; the "<a href="Manchester%20Guardian">Manchester Guardian</a>" described him as "perhaps the most useful practical statesman of the present day". Although still weak from a previous serious illness, he felt it was his duty as Liverpool's MP to attend the opening of the railway.

In late 1829, with construction of the railway almost complete, the <a href="Rainhill%20Trials">Rainhill Trials</a> were held on a short level stretch of the completed line near <a href="Rainhill">Rainhill</a>, to test how the track withstood locomotives running over it and to determine which type of locomotive would be used, with a £500 prize at stake. The Trials were widely publicised, and 10,000–15,000 people attended the first day on 6 October 1829. Of the five entrants "<a href="Stephenson%27s%20Rocket">Rocket</a>", built by George Stephenson and his son <a href="Robert%20Stephenson">Robert</a>, was the only entrant to complete the trial without suffering a serious failure, and was duly selected as the design to be used. (Although often described as a race, and shown as such in illustrations, the Rainhill Trials were a series of independent trials. Each engine ran on a different day.) At around the time of the Rainhill Trials the tunnel to the forthcoming Liverpool terminus—the first tunnel ever dug under a major built-up area—was completed. To win over sceptical locals it was whitewashed, fitted with lighting and a band, and the public charged a <a href="shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a> apiece to walk through it.

By early 1830 the line was almost complete, and locomotives began trial runs over the route. On 14 June 1830 a test run from Liverpool to <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a> drew two passenger carriages and seven fully loaded coal wagons for in 2 hours 25 minutes without incident. Booth convened a meeting of the directors that evening, who decided that the railway would be ready to open in late summer. After consulting with the office of the Duke of Wellington over when he would be available to attend an inauguration ceremony, and learning that he was due in the area on 13 September to attend a dinner in Manchester, it was agreed that the railway would formally open on Wednesday 15 September 1830.
Actress, author and anti-slavery campaigner <a href="Fanny%20Kemble">Fanny Kemble</a>, who accompanied George Stephenson on a test of the L&M prior to its opening, described the tests in a letter written in early 1830:

The directors of the L&M set out to do all they could to make the opening day a success. It was decided that for the opening, the dignitaries and guests would assemble in Liverpool, and eight of the L&M's locomotives would haul them in special trains to <a href="Liverpool%20Road%20railway%20station%20%28Manchester%29">Liverpool Road railway station</a>, the railway's Manchester terminus. A number of covered railway carriages "resembling the most luxurious of road coaches", with cushioned seating and cloth linings and each capable of carrying between 12 and 24 passengers, were provided for the more important persons among those attending. More basic open carriages, described by an observer as "plain homely unadorned butter-and-egg sort of market carts", each carried 60 passengers. Cabinetmaker James Edmondson was commissioned to design a special carriage for the Duke of Wellington and his companions, described by <a href="Egerton%20Smith">Egerton Smith</a> as: 

This special train was divided into four carriages. Behind the locomotive was a wagon carrying a band, and behind it were three passenger carriages, with the Duke's special carriage in the centre. It was drawn by "<a href="Northumbrian%20%28locomotive%29">Northumbrian</a>", Stephenson's most advanced locomotive at the time with a engine. The Duke's train was to run on the southern of the L&M's two tracks, and the other seven trains would run on the northern track, to ensure the Duke would not be delayed should any of the other trains encounter problems.

The gathering of the dignitaries at the station and the departure of the trains was a major event. Every hotel room and lodging-house in Liverpool was full the night before. From 9.00 am onwards the area around the station was filled with people, and crowds thronged the trackside at Liverpool to watch the trains depart. One group of men had each paid two shillings for access to the best vantage point, the top of a chimney near the tunnel leading to <a href="Crown%20Street%20railway%20station">Crown Street railway station</a>; they were hoisted up by rope and board shortly after dawn to watch proceedings.
Shortly before 10.00 am as the Duke of Wellington arrived, a band played "<a href="Judas%20Maccabaeus%20%28Handel%29">See, the Conquering Hero Comes</a>" in his honour, beginning a tradition of the song being played at almost every British railway station opening from then on. The Duke's party entered their carriage; a gun was then fired to mark the opening of the railway. The Duke's carriages had their brakes released and were allowed to roll down the incline under the force of gravity to be coupled to the waiting "Northumbrian".

Soldiers cleared the tracks of onlookers, and the procession of trains left Crown Street station in Liverpool at 11.00 am, William and Emily Huskisson travelled in the Ducal train, in the passenger carriage immediately in front of the Duke's carriage. "Northumbrian" slowed periodically to allow the seven trains on the northern track to parade past it, but generally ran ahead of the other trains.

Near <a href="Parr%2C%20St%20Helens">Parr</a>, about out of Liverpool, the world's first passenger train-on-train collision took place, as described by "A Railer" in "<a href="Blackwood%27s%20Edinburgh%20Magazine">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</a>", who was travelling in the lead train on the northern track, hauled by "<a href="Phoenix%20%28locomotive%29">Phoenix</a>":
With no reported injuries from this incident, the wheels of the derailed "Phoenix" were remounted on the rails and the journey continued. After crossing the <a href="Sankey%20Viaduct">Sankey Viaduct</a>, the trains passed Warrington Junction, where George Stephenson's <a href="Warrington%20and%20Newton%20Railway">Warrington and Newton Railway</a> was under construction in the expectation of eventual extension southwards to link the L&M to Birmingham and London. After passing Warrington Junction, the parade of trains passed through the historic market town of <a href="Newton-le-Willows">Newton-le-Willows</a>, roughly at the midpoint of the line. Fifty-five minutes after leaving Liverpool the procession was scheduled to stop for the locomotives to take on water at <a href="Parkside%20railway%20station%20%28Merseyside%29">Parkside railway station</a>, half a mile east of Newton-le-Willows and from Liverpool.

Although in an isolated rural area, Parkside station had been designed as a <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> and <a href="water%20stop">water stop</a> for proposed connections with the <a href="Wigan%20Branch%20Railway">Wigan Branch Railway</a> and the <a href="Bolton%20and%20Leigh%20Railway">Bolton and Leigh Railway</a>, and had multiple lines of rails in place. A leaflet given to those travelling on the trains advised that while: 

The Duke's train had run more slowly through populated areas owing to the cheering crowds, and by the time it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, "Phoenix" and "North Star", had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling for almost an hour, and the water stop at Parkside was the only scheduled stop on the journey. Although it was beginning to <a href="drizzle">drizzle</a>, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55 am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to stretch their legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, <a href="Charles%20Arbuthnot">Charles Arbuthnot</a>, <a href="Paul%20Anton%20III%2C%20Prince%20Esterh%C3%A1zy">Prince Esterházy</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Egerton%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Wilton">the Earl of Wilton</a>, L&M founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles on either side of the railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.

The group stood around the rail lines and discussed the events of the day and the potential of rail travel. According to Sandars, Huskisson congratulated him on the achievement of his vision, and said to Sandars that he "must be one of the happiest men in the world". <a href="William%20Holmes%20%28Member%20of%20Parliament%29">William Holmes</a>, the <a href="Chief%20Whip">Chief Whip</a>, then called Huskisson to one side. He suggested that, with the Duke of Wellington in a particularly good mood owing to the cheering crowds which had lined the route, it might be a good time for Huskisson and the Duke to meet and try to arrange a reconciliation.

The Duke of Wellington was becoming unpopular as Prime Minister, particularly in the industrial north west of England, for continually blocking proposed reforms. Huskisson saw himself as well placed to unite the two wings of the <a href="Tory%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> party should the Duke retire, or to lead the reforming faction of the party into a split from the Tories and a progressive alliance with the <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whigs</a>. He also saw himself as a natural ally for the Duke, despite their political differences, as a Tory popular in Liverpool and Manchester, both of which were traditionally hostile to the party. Newspapers were already beginning to report rumours that Huskisson and his supporters were to be invited back into the government.

Huskisson saw the Duke of Wellington sitting in the front corner of his special carriage. Huskisson walked along the tracks to the carriage, extended a hand, and the Duke reached out of the carriage and shook it.

As Huskisson and the Duke of Wellington exchanged greetings, some of the crowd saw "Rocket", hauling the third of the seven trains on the northern track, approaching in the distance. They shouted "An engine is approaching, take care gentlemen" to those people—including Huskisson—standing on the tracks.

The men gathered on the track moved out of the way of the approaching "Rocket", either by climbing onto the embankment or getting back into their carriages. Unlike the other carriages, Edmondson had not equipped the Duke's carriage with fixed steps. Instead, a movable set of steps was at the back of the carriage, to be moved into position to allow travellers to board and alight at whichever part of the carriage was most convenient. With "Rocket" approaching, there was not time to fetch the movable steps. With "Rocket" away, only Holmes, Huskisson and Esterházy remained on the tracks. <a href="Edward%20Littleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hatherton">Edward Littleton</a> MP, a passenger in the Duke's carriage, reached out to Esterházy and hauled him into the carriage to safety.

<a href="Joseph%20Locke">Joseph Locke</a>, driving "Rocket", now saw that there were people on the line ahead. "Rocket" was an engineering prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As "Rocket" continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung to the side of the Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning to the side of the carriage.

The space between the rails was , and the carriages overhung the outside rails by . Pressed against the side of the carriage, the remaining gap was just enough for Huskisson and Holmes to escape without injury, but Huskisson misjudged the distance. According to Edward Littleton, the Duke of Wellington said to Huskisson "We seem to be going on—you had better step in!" Huskisson tried to clamber into the carriage, but those inside failed to reach him to pull him in. Holmes, still pressed against the carriage, shouted "For God's sake, Mr Huskisson, be firm", but Huskisson grabbed the door of the carriage. With Holmes still pressed against the side of the carriage, the door, with Huskisson hanging on to it, swung out directly into the path of "Rocket". "Rocket" collided with the door and Huskisson fell onto the track in front of the locomotive.

In the words of <a href="Harriet%20Arbuthnot">Harriet Arbuthnot</a>, who was in the Duke's carriage, '[Huskisson] was caught by it, thrown down & the engine passed over his leg & thigh, crushing it in a most frightful way. It is impossible to give an idea of the scene that followed, of the horror of everyone present or of the piercing shrieks of his unfortunate wife, who was in the car. He said scarcely more than, "It's all over with me. Bring me my wife and let me die.

 <a href="Joseph%20Parkes">Joseph Parkes</a>, Lord Wilton and <a href="William%20Rathbone%20V">William Rathbone</a> were the first to reach Huskisson. They found that a wheel had passed over his right calf and thigh, leaving his knee itself untouched. A flap of skin on his upper leg had been cut back, exposing the muscles, and the exposed arteries had not been severed but were flattened, pulsing with Huskisson's heartbeat. The damaged leg shook uncontrollably. Observers noted that Huskisson did not appear to be in pain, and instead lay watching the leg shake. Huskisson shouted "This is the death of me". Parkes attempted to reassure him, but Huskisson replied "Yes, I am dying, call Mrs Huskisson". A man threw his coat over William Huskisson's leg to spare Emily Huskisson from seeing the extent of his injuries, and she was helped from the carriage in which she had been sitting. In hysterics, she attempted to throw herself onto Huskisson, but was restrained by fellow passengers as Lord Wilton applied a makeshift tourniquet he had made using handkerchiefs and an elderly passenger's walking stick. Other passengers ripped the door of a nearby railway storeroom from its hinges, to serve as a makeshift stretcher. Huskisson was lifted onto the door, shaking his head and saying "Where is Mrs Huskisson? I have met my death, God forgive me." (Garfield, writing in 2002, gives his words as "This is my death, God forgive me".)
Men ran along the track in both directions to tell the other trains not to proceed. In the initial panic, the first thought of many of those present was that the Prime Minister had been assassinated.

<a href="Henry%20Herbert%20Southey">Henry Herbert Southey</a>, physician to the recently deceased <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a>, had travelled in the Duke's train, as had Dr Hunter, professor of anatomy at the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>. The two of them rushed to Huskisson's side, joined shortly afterwards by Joseph Brandreth, a Liverpool surgeon who had been travelling behind "Phoenix". The doctors suggested returning Huskisson to Liverpool for treatment, but George Stephenson insisted that it would be better to take him on to Manchester.
Huskisson was loaded onto the flat-bottomed wagon of the Duke's train which had carried the band. The remaining three carriages of the Duke's train were detached and the band's carriage, hauled by "Northumbrian", set off for Manchester with Stephenson driving. Lord Wilton held Huskisson's hands and arms steady, while <a href="John%20Colville%2C%209th%20Lord%20Colville%20of%20Culross">Lord Colville</a> supported his head on his knees and tried to cushion him from the vibration of the train. With the train almost unladen and Stephenson running the engine flat-out, the train reached the speed of almost , briefly giving those on board the world speed record. The crowds lining the route, unaware of what had happened, cheered and waved as "Northumbrian" rushed past.

Believing Huskisson to be near death, Brandreth suggested that the party stop at the first house they came to. After some discussion the doctors decided to stop at the <a href="vicarage">vicarage</a> of the Rev. Thomas Blackburne, vicar of <a href="Eccles%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Eccles</a>, four miles (6.4 km) short of Manchester. When told of the decision, Huskisson concurred, saying "Pray do so, I am sure my friend Blackburne will be kind to me", unaware that Blackburne had been invited to the inauguration of the railway and was now waiting with the rest of the passengers at Parkside.

By the time the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been replaced by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.

The party arrived at the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had originally intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment that something was wrong at home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a> were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided to remain in the vicarage.) Huskisson was moved to the sofa, and given <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a> and brandy. At about 2.00 pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were baffled by the nature of the damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.

The doctors decided that Huskisson was likely to survive but his injured leg was likely to need amputation. With no medicines or surgical tools, they waited for the arrival of the surgical equipment and medical specialists Stephenson had gone to summon from Manchester.
A coach from Manchester eventually arrived bearing four surgeons, led by <a href="William%20Robert%20Whatton">William Robert Whatton</a>. By this time Huskisson was suffering severe spasms, and those present were having to hold his arms and legs down to stop him falling off the sofa. Whatton assessed that Huskisson was suffering from severe <a href="haemorrhaging">haemorrhaging</a> from the initial wound and subsequent blood loss, and that <a href="amputation">amputation</a> was necessary to prevent a fatal loss of blood. However, in Huskisson's agitated condition Whatton felt that traumatic surgery would likely prove fatal. Whatton and his colleagues applied warm water to Huskisson's chest, feet and hands, and gave him warm cordials and further laudanum in an effort to calm him enough to withstand the shock of surgery. At around 3.00 pm the party heard the sound of cannon fire from the west. Told that the cannons were probably being fired to mark the arrival of the Prime Minister in Manchester, Huskisson said "I hope to God the Duke may get safe through the day". At around 4.00 pm Huskisson had regained enough strength to dictate to William Wainewright, his secretary, a brief amendment to his will ensuring that Emily Huskisson would inherit all his property, and shakily signed it. He then requested the <a href="Anglican%20sacraments">sacrament</a>, which was performed by the Rev Blackburne, and read the <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a> with Wilton. When Huskisson came to the line "and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us", he said ""That" I do most heartily; and I declare to God that I have not the slightest feeling of ill-will towards any human being."

Meanwhile, back at Parkside the other seven trains had come to a halt following the accident. The <a href="electrical%20telegraph">electrical telegraph</a> had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with "Northumbrian", with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L&M staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and to get a glimpse of the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and <a href="Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a>, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.
At about the time Whatton's party of surgeons arrived at Eccles, riders on horseback arrived at Parkside from Manchester and Salford. They reported that the crowd in Manchester was becoming restless, and that the authorities feared a riot if the Duke did not arrive. The Duke's party returned to Edmondson's elaborate ducal carriage, still on the southern track. "Northumbrian" had gone ahead with Huskisson and the other seven locomotives were all on the northern track, and there was no way to move what remained of the Duke's train onto the northern track or transfer a locomotive to the southern. A long chain was tied between "Phoenix" on the northern track, and the three remaining carriages of the Duke's train on the southern track. At 1.30 pm "Phoenix" and its train were then attached to "North Star" and its train and the two locomotives set out at low speed towards Manchester, passing Eccles and heading into the deserted marshland of <a href="Chat%20Moss">Chat Moss</a>.

As Wellington's makeshift train slowly headed towards Manchester, it was accompanied along the route by cheering crowds, still unaware of the accident. As they passed the milepost marking from Liverpool, in the middle of Chat Moss, they met Stephenson and "Northumbrian" on the southern track, returning from Manchester. Stephenson told the party of Huskisson's condition when he last saw him before leaving Eccles for Manchester (erroneously claiming that amputation had already been attempted successfully), and boasted of having set a new speed record. The three remaining carriages of Wellington's original train, still on the southern track, were detached from the train and attached to "Northumbrian", which set off at full speed for Manchester. As the train approached Manchester the trackside bystanders became increasingly hostile, booing, hissing and waving banners against Wellington. Hostile crowds spilled onto the track, forcing the trains to slow to a crawl. Eventually the crowds on the track became so dense they were unable to disperse as the trains approached, and the trains were obliged "to play the part of the <a href="juggernaut">juggernaut</a> car", pushing people out of their path with their own momentum.
The Duke of Wellington arrived at Liverpool Road, the L&M's Manchester terminus, a little before 3.00 pm. As the messengers sent to Parkside had warned, the crowd had become hostile; one observer described them as "A slovenly, ragged set, with hair uncombed and beards unshaven, with waistcoats open, exhibiting unwashed skin, dirty linen, and bare necks." While some present cheered, others—especially weavers—hissed the Duke and pelted his carriage with vegetables. Two "<a href="tricolour%20%28flag%29">tricolore</a>" flags were hoisted, and banners reading "No Corn Laws" and "Vote by Ballot" were waved. The passengers on the trains disembarked and headed to a buffet of cold meats in the L&M's warehouse. On disembarking from the train the Rev Thomas Blackburne learned for the first time that Huskisson was in his vicarage, and rushed home to Eccles by horse. Fearing the hostile crowd, Wellington refused to leave his carriage, sent for food to be brought in to him, and ordered that the locomotives be readied for return to Liverpool as soon as possible. At 4.37 pm the trains began to pull out of Manchester to head back to Liverpool.

The hasty departure from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures and a lack of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable to get out of the station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30 pm the Duke arrived in <a href="Roby%2C%20Merseyside">Roby</a>, and went to spend the night at the <a href="James%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Marquess of Salisbury</a>'s house at <a href="Childwall%20Hall">Childwall Hall</a>. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5 mph (8 km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.

The eight trains had been scheduled to arrive back in Liverpool at 4.00 pm. By 7.00 pm, the passenger train was not yet even halfway back to Liverpool. As darkness fell it began to rain, and the drivers, fearing for the safety of the trains in the dark and wet, slowed the train further. As it had not been intended that the inaugural journey take place in the darkness the trains were not fitted with lighting or engine lamps; the driver of "<a href="Comet%20%28locomotive%29">Comet</a>", leading the train, held a burning tarry rope to light the way ahead. Although some of the crowds lining the route were now dispersing, many others had remained to see the trains return. These crowds had been drinking all day; as the train passed under bridges the train, with its open carriages, was pelted with objects thrown down from the bridges, and on one occasion "Comet" struck a wheelbarrow, apparently deliberately placed across the rails. Passing Eccles, the train stopped briefly for enquiries to be made about Huskisson; those enquiring were told that he was looking frail, and a successful operation was unlikely in his current condition.
Shortly after passing the accident site at Parkside, the train passed a group of uniformed men walking along the railway carrying a variety of objects. It later transpired that this was the band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and walked home, along a grass verge that was turning to mud under the heavy rain. As the train passed <a href="Sutton%2C%20Merseyside">Sutton</a> the three engines were unable to haul the combined weight of the train up an incline, and 400 of the men aboard were obliged to get out of the train and walk for a mile, illuminated only by the sparks flying from the locomotives, as the engines slowly hauled the empty carriages up the gradient. The train finally arrived in Liverpool at 10.30 pm. Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of somewhere to sleep.

The group who had watched the departure of the trains from the top of the chimney near the Liverpool tunnel, meanwhile, had been forgotten in the confusion, and were unable to get down from their vantage point. Eventually at around 8.00 pm John Harrison, a teacher of gymnastics and swordsmanship, lowered himself down the rope hand-over-hand, and coaxed the others to follow him down in the same manner. The angry group then set out in search of the worker who had been supposed to bring them down.

<a href="James%20Radley">James Radley</a>, owner of Liverpool's landmark <a href="Britannia%20Adelphi%20Hotel">Adelphi Hotel</a>, had laid on a banquet for 7.00 pm to celebrate "the success and promotion of steam power". He had prepared food for 230, and sold 60 advance tickets. By 9.00 pm, with most of the passengers still on the train back from Manchester including Liverpool trade magnate <a href="Sir%20William%20Brown%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Richmond%20Hill">William Brown</a> who was to chair the meeting, only 20 people had turned up. Businessman and politician <a href="John%20Ashton%20Yates">John Ashton Yates</a> was drafted in to replace Brown, and the 20 diners began a subdued two-hour meal, frequently interrupted by riders bringing the latest news from Eccles. During the main course messages were brought that an operation had been performed successfully and that Huskisson was recovering; by dessert another messenger brought the message that no operation had been performed after all, and that Huskisson was worsening. By the time the meal concluded at around 11.00 pm, no reliable news of Huskisson's condition had arrived. Following a toast to the King and to Huskisson's recovery, steamship pioneer <a href="Francis%20B.%20Ogden">Francis B. Ogden</a>, at the time the American <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">Consul</a> in Liverpool, gave a speech about the planned <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> and of forthcoming schemes to connect New Orleans with the Great Lakes by rail. Although they did not know it, by this time Huskisson was already dead.

As the evening progressed Huskisson continued to weaken. The doctors had concluded that without amputation he would continue to deteriorate, but that he had no realistic chance of surviving major surgery, and broke this news to the Huskissons. William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused "a dreadful scene ... but at last she calmed herself and during the rest of the time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth "You see I shall never live to make any return for your kindness. You have done all that is possible, but it is all in vain." After further laudanum, he complained "Why endeavour to support my strength? I must die, it is only prolonging my sufferings."

At about 11.00 pm that night William Wainewright sat down in Blackburne's study at Eccles vicarage to write a brief letter to the Mayor of Liverpool.

At 7:30 am the next morning, the Duke of Wellington wrote to the Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the circumstances any kind of celebration would be inappropriate, and said that he would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard the news and remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.

Given Huskisson's importance, and the potential impact on the future of Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability on the part of the railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00 am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened <a href="coroner%27s%20jury">coroner's jury</a> was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, Mr Milne, arrived at 10.00 am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.

After his death Huskisson's body had been moved from the sofa on which he had died to an upstairs bedroom. On arrival at the vicarage Emily Huskisson refused to allow the jury to view the body, insisting on being allowed to remain alone with her husband. Eventually she had to be forcibly removed from the room, and the jury went into the bedroom in small groups to view the body. As "they did not think it necessary to look at the injured parts at all", they took only a brief glance at the body, and soon afterwards returned to the Grapes.
Eventually a little after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. <a href="Granville%20Leveson-Gower%2C%201st%20Earl%20Granville">Lord Granville</a> (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been suffering from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised from any of the locomotives involved, including "Rocket", although a system of warning flags was supposed to have been in place.

Although some eyewitnesses expressed the view that Joseph Locke, driving "Rocket", was at fault, following a few words from the coroner the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The directors and engineers of the L&M were explicitly absolved of all blame, and no <a href="deodand">deodand</a> was to be attached to the locomotive or the railway.

After the inquest was over, Emily Huskisson found two speeches in William Huskisson's jacket pocket, which he had been planning to deliver following the inaugural journey. The first was a brief tribute to <a href="James%20Watt">James Watt</a>, the inventor of the condensing steam engine, and to all that his invention had made possible. The second was a longer speech. It was marked "to be burnt at my death", but as it was one of the last things her husband had written Emily Huskisson felt herself unable to do so.

Huskisson's death was a major incident, and was reported worldwide. (William Huskisson is often reported as the first railway fatality, including in ordinarily reliable sources. This is untrue; at least two people were killed on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway prior to its opening to the public. The earliest recorded fatality caused by a steam locomotive was an unnamed woman, described as "a blind American beggar", fatally injured by a train on the <a href="Stockton%20and%20Darlington%20Railway">Stockton and Darlington Railway</a> on 5 March 1827. As a high-profile figure killed at a high-profile event, Huskisson was the first railway fatality to be widely reported.) As news of the incident gradually spread across the country, railways and steam power, matters which had previously been of interest only to those involved in industries directly affected by them, became a major topic for discussion across Britain. For the first time, the population as a whole became aware that cheap, rapid travel was possible, and that a journey which had previously been extremely expensive and taken the better part of a day was now affordable and took less than two hours. In the afternoon of 16 September, the day after the inauguration of the line, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway began operating a regular scheduled service. The first train carried 130 passengers (mainly members of the <a href="Society%20of%20Friends">Society of Friends</a> attending a meeting in Manchester), with tickets from Liverpool to Manchester costing 7<a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">s</a> (about £ in 2019 terms) apiece. By the end of the first week of operation, 6,104 passengers had travelled on the railway.

Emily Huskisson planned for William Huskisson to be buried near the family home in <a href="Eartham">Eartham</a> in a small service. On 17 September, three days after Huskisson's death, Lord Granville and a delegation of Liverpool clergymen visited Eccles vicarage to present Emily Huskisson with a petition, signed by 264 Liverpool dignitaries, "requesting that his remains may be interred within the precincts of this town, in which his distinguished public worth and private virtue secured for him the respect and esteem of the whole community", and she agreed to his burial in Liverpool instead. She refused to allow any form of parade or pageantry, or a suggested <a href="gun%20salute">gun salute</a>.

On 18 September Huskisson's body was placed in a coffin and covered with black silk. Shortly before midnight a team of men prepared to move the coffin to a hearse which had been parked outside since the afternoon, but Emily Huskisson refused to allow them to take the body. Instead, she spent another night in the vicarage with the coffin. The next morning she left in a horse-drawn carriage with the windows covered. The coffin, meanwhile, set off in the hearse for Liverpool. Although the funeral party changed horses only at remote and quiet <a href="coaching%20inn">coaching inn</a>s to avoid attention, it gathered followers as it progressed; by the time it reached <a href="Liverpool%20Town%20Hall">Liverpool Town Hall</a> late that evening, the hearse was followed by at least 10 carriages and more than 500 mourners on foot.

For William Huskisson's funeral on Friday 24 September, almost every business in Liverpool was closed. Huskisson had been a popular figure in Liverpool, and the authorities expected large numbers of people wishing to attend. In an effort to control numbers it was announced that anyone wishing to join the cortège submit a written request in writing to the Town Hall. This proved impractical, and the authorities put up posters around the town advising that anyone in <a href="mourning%20dress">mourning dress</a> would be allowed to join the procession. Colour coded tickets were issued to those wishing to attend the burial, with each colour representing a different section of the cemetery, in an effort to control crowd numbers at the burial service; a total of 3,000 tickets were issued.

Although Emily Huskisson had wanted to keep the service small-scale and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.
Huskisson's coffin was placed on a trestle table in the Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with feathered plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00 am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin by a group of truncheon men. At 10.00 two <a href="Mute%20%28death%20customs%29">mutes</a> guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, followed by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were followed by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, followed by two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, followed by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers <a href="Thomas%20Huskisson">Thomas</a> and Samuel. These in turn were followed by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8 km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.

The procession left the town hall and slowly went the via <a href="Hope%20Street%2C%20Liverpool">Hope Street</a> to an iron-lined grave in <a href="St%20James%20Cemetery">St James Cemetery</a>, accompanied by muffled church bells. Iron rails were erected along the length of the funeral procession to hold back the crowd of around 50,000 people who lined the route. Emily Huskisson, devastated by grief, did not attend the funeral. Despite her objection to gun salutes a 32-pounder cannon was fired to mark the departure of the coffin from the town hall and a 6-pounder was fired to mark the body's arrival at the cemetery, and smaller guns were fired as the procession passed. On arrival at the cemetery a short 15 minute service was held, after which Huskisson's close mourners moved to the graveside and Huskisson was placed in his grave, to the accompaniment of weeping from his brothers. Shortly before 1.00 pm another cannon shot marked the end of the service, and the crowd dispersed; pubs and restaurants throughout Liverpool remained shut for the rest of the day.

Twelve days after the opening of the L&M, Liverpool surgeon Thomas Weatherill wrote to "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" questioning the official version of Huskisson's death and calling the behaviour of the doctors who had attended Eccles vicarage "unscientific, inefficient and imbecilic". He had spoken to eyewitnesses, and concluded that Huskisson's weakness and spasms following the accident were caused by blood loss, not internal injury, and that amputation would have stemmed the blood loss and saved Huskisson's life. He went on to claim that those eyewitnesses he had spoken to had seen Huskisson bleeding heavily, but that no effort had been made to stem the bleeding other than Lord Wilton's makeshift tourniquet of handkerchiefs. He argued that those doctors attending should at least have made an attempt at amputation when it became clear that other measures were not working.
Two weeks later William Whatton replied. He disputed Weatherill's claim that the only action taken to staunch the blood flow had been the handkerchief, and pointed out that his first action on arrival at Eccles vicarage had been to seal Huskisson's <a href="femoral%20artery">femoral artery</a>. He stated that he had great experience with similar injuries from his time as an army doctor during the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>, and that "none of them [military surgeons] would have ventured upon an operation where the chances were so decidedly against its success". He pointed out that the survival rate for amputations among soldiers with similar injuries—considerably healthier than the elderly Huskisson—was no better than 15% when attempted immediately after the injury. Instead, he cited the advice of leading surgeon <a href="George%20James%20Guthrie">George James Guthrie</a> that amputation was not generally survivable until the patient's pulse had stabilised and the initial shock settled. Whatton pointed out that Huskisson's pulse did not stabilise and that he was in convulsions for the entire time Whatton attended him.

Weatherill did not accept Whatton's defence. He continued to maintain that the delays in staunching the blood flow were "unforgivable", and that with Huskisson obviously dying there had been nothing to lose by attempting surgery. He also pointed out that if Huskisson had been fit enough to dictate a will, he may well have been fit enough to withstand an operation.

The accidents on its opening day gave the Liverpool and Manchester Railway huge amounts of publicity, and greatly increased public awareness of the potential of rapid transport. The L&M's passenger service proved immediately successful. In October the Duke of Wellington's special train was put into use as a dedicated first-class train, making four journeys each day between Liverpool and Manchester in each direction. On 4 December 1830 goods operations on the L&M began, with <a href="Planet%20%28locomotive%29">"Planet"</a> hauling 75 <a href="long%20ton">tons</a> of freight from Liverpool to Manchester. In the first six months of 1831 the L&M carried 188,726 passengers and 35,800 tons of goods; in the year from the opening in September 1830 to September 1831, almost 500,000 passengers were carried. At George Stephenson's insistence new locomotives bought by the L&M were fitted with handbrakes from 1831.

The original Crown Street terminus soon proved unable to handle the growing popularity of the railway, and was replaced by <a href="Liverpool%20Lime%20Street%20railway%20station">Liverpool Lime Street railway station</a> in 1836. With more advanced locomotives no longer needing to stop midway to take on water Parkside station soon closed, and little trace of it remains. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway remains operational as the northern of the two <a href="Liverpool%20to%20Manchester%20Lines">Liverpool to Manchester Lines</a>. The opening of the L&M is now considered the dawn of the age of mechanised transport; in the words of industrialist and former <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> chairman <a href="Peter%20Parker%20%28British%20businessman%29">Peter Parker</a>, "the world is a branch line of the pioneering Liverpool–Manchester run".

Spurred by the L&M's success, within a month of its opening schemes were announced to link Liverpool and Manchester to other major cities, including London, Leeds, Birmingham and Bradford, uniting the key industrial centres of England. The <a href="London%20and%20Birmingham%20Railway">London and Birmingham Railway</a> (also built by George Stephenson), the first railway to link the north and south of England, was completed in 1838. By 1840 of track had been laid in Britain. The <a href="Railway%20Regulation%20Act%201844">Railway Regulation Act 1844</a> limited passenger fares to one <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">penny</a> ( of a pound) per mile on the entire British railway network, enabling mass population movements, migration to the cities and long-distance commuting, and the social revolution of mass rapid transit began. In 1846 alone 272 new railways were authorised in Britain, and by 1850 over of railways were in place and Britain's transformation into an industrial superpower was complete. The expertise of Britain's railway pioneers itself became a major export, and British engineers (including Stephenson) supplied almost all the locomotives and rails for the railways then being built across Europe and North America.

"Rocket" remained in use with the L&M after the accident, albeit rarely used for anything other than internal engineering duties. The more advanced "Planet" design was better suited to heavy loads, and "Rocket" became redundant. In 1834 it was used for experiments with new drive systems, after which it was put in storage. In 1836 it was sold to the <a href="Midgeholme%20Coalfield">Midgeholme Colliery</a>, and used to haul coal until 1844.
Subsequently recognised as the design from which all later locomotives are derived, "Rocket" eventually came to be considered one of the most important symbols of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. It was returned to <a href="Robert%20Stephenson%20and%20Company">Robert Stephenson and Company</a> in 1851 with the intention of displaying it at <a href="The%20Great%20Exhibition">The Great Exhibition</a>, but this did not take place. It was loaned to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Intellectual%20Property%20Office">Patent Office</a> for display in 1862. Moved to the <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">Science Collection of the South Kensington Museum</a> in 1876 (renamed the Science Museum in 1885), it has remained there ever since other than a brief display at the <a href="National%20Railway%20Museum">National Railway Museum</a>.

In 1929 a replica "Rocket" was commissioned from Robert Stephenson and Company by <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>, using Stephenson's original construction techniques. It was intended as a centrepiece of the <a href="The%20Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford Museum</a>, where it remains. Another fully functioning replica was built in the 1970s for the National Railway Museum. In 1999, to mark the 170th anniversary of the Rainhill Trials, the Trials were re-enacted on the <a href="Llangollen%20Railway">Llangollen Railway</a> using this replica and replicas of "<a href="Novelty%20%28locomotive%29">Novelty</a>" and "<a href="Sans%20Pareil">Sans Pareil</a>", the other serious contenders in 1829. "Rocket" again won.

Huskisson's supporters refused an offer to return to the Duke of Wellington's cabinet after his death, and at the beginning of November Wellington announced to Parliament that "the constitution needed no improvement and that he would resist any measure of parliamentary reform as long as he was in office". Fearing serious social unrest, large numbers of Tory MPs rebelled in a vote on governmental expenses. On 15 November 1830, exactly two months after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, Wellington lost a vote of no confidence and was replaced as Prime Minister a week later by <a href="Charles%20Grey%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Grey">Earl Grey</a>. Grey set about reforming Britain's corrupt and antiquated electoral procedure, the issue over which Huskisson had resigned. In 1832 the <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20Act%201832">Representation of the People Act</a> (commonly known as the Reform Act) was finally passed.

Wellington spent the remainder of his life implacably opposed to railways, complaining that they would "encourage the lower classes to travel about". He avoided them for more than a decade, before agreeing in 1843 to accompany <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> for a trip on the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a> (designed by Joseph Locke, driver of "Rocket" on 15 September 1830). He died of a stroke on 14 September 1852; it is estimated that one and a half million people attended his funeral.

William Huskisson's death made him one of the most famous British politicians of the period. Within a year his first biography was published, as was a volume of his collected speeches. His policies on free trade and minimal government interference were a major influence on Robert Peel and <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a> (who grew up in Liverpool and whose father <a href="Sir%20John%20Gladstone%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Gladstone</a> had been a close colleague of Huskisson) and consequently on the later emergence of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> and the doctrine of <a href="Gladstonian%20Liberalism">Gladstonian Liberalism</a>. Forty years after his death Huskisson was still sufficiently well-remembered to be featured in novels, including "<a href="Middlemarch">Middlemarch</a>" and the novels of <a href="Ellen%20Wood%20%28author%29">Mrs Henry Wood</a>, with no accompanying explanation. The Australian town of <a href="Huskisson%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Huskisson, New South Wales</a> is named for him. <a href="Huskisson%20Dock">Huskisson Dock</a>, named in his honour in 1852, remains in operation as part of the Port of Liverpool. In 1880 <a href="Huskisson%20railway%20station">Huskisson railway station</a> in Liverpool opened, closing to passengers five years later but remaining operational as a goods depot until 1975. Today he is principally remembered for the manner of his death, and monuments to him stand in <a href="Pimlico">Pimlico</a>, <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a>, and Liverpool. In 1982, at a time of high racial tension following the <a href="Toxteth%20riots">Toxteth riots</a>, his memorial in Liverpool was pulled down by a group of local people in the mistaken belief that it commemorated a slave trader; it was re-erected around 20 years later in Duke Street, near where he had stayed for his final nights in Liverpool.

Emily Huskisson returned to Eartham and lived a quiet life, dedicated to keeping alive her husband's memory. She died in 1856. She never returned to Liverpool, and never again travelled by train.

On the ruins of Parkside station stands a white stone memorial, once badly damaged by vandals but since restored. The original inscription from the memorial has been removed for safekeeping, and is now displayed in the National Railway Museum.

Cyclone Waka

Severe Tropical Cyclone Waka (<a href="Fiji%20Meteorological%20Service">Fiji Meteorological Service</a> designation: 03F, <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> designation: 07P) was one of the most destructive <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s ever to affect the South Pacific <a href="Tonga">Kingdom of Tonga</a>. Waka originated within the <a href="near-equatorial%20trough">near-equatorial trough</a> in mid-December 2001, although the system remained disorganized for more than a week. The storm gradually matured and attained tropical cyclone status on December 29. Subsequently, Waka underwent <a href="Rapid%20deepening">rapid intensification</a> in which it attained its peak intensity as a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">Category 4 severe tropical cyclone</a> (<a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale</a>) on December 31, with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Shortly thereafter, it passed directly over <a href="Vava%CA%BBu">Vavaʻu</a>, Tonga, resulting in widespread damage. By January 1, 2002, the cyclone began to weaken as it underwent an <a href="Extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical transition</a>. The remnants of Waka persisted for several more days and were last observed near the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> on January 6.

Although the storm affected several countries along its path, Waka left the most significant losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2 million <a href="Tongan%20pa%CA%BBanga">paʻanga</a> ($51.3 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, and much of the nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every tree on the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population due to the lack of fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming%23Retirement">retired</a> and replaced with Wiki. According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33 years.

In mid-December 2001, at the end of a <a href="Madden%E2%80%93Julian%20oscillation">Madden–Julian oscillation</a> pulse, twin <a href="equator">equator</a>ial <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoonal troughs</a> developed in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern</a> and <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern</a> Hemispheres. Although warm <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s of in the region favored development of a tropical cyclone, the southern trough developed substantially slower than the northern one. On December 19, the southern component was classified as Tropical Depression 03F by the <a href="Regional%20Specialized%20Meteorological%20Center">Regional Specialized Meteorological Center</a> in <a href="Nadi%2C%20Fiji">Nadi, Fiji</a> (<a href="Fiji%20Meteorological%20Service">Fiji Meteorological Service</a>); at this time the depression was situated just east of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The northern component eventually developed into <a href="2001%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Typhoon%20Faxai">Typhoon Faxai</a>, an extremely powerful <a href="SSHS%23Category%205">Category 5 equivalent</a> cyclone. Unlike Faxai, the precursor to Cyclone Waka developed slowly, mainly because of moderate <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> in the region. Moving southeastward, the system gradually became more organized. On two occasions, the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) issued a <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Formation%20Alert">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a>; however, the agency later canceled them both times. By December 27, the depression had entered a region of lesser shear, favoring significant development of the system. The following day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07P, when the storm was situated roughly northwest of <a href="Pago%20Pago">Pago Pago</a>, <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>.

Tracking towards the southwest in response to a mid-level <a href="Ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to the southeast, the depression quickly intensified, attaining <a href="Wind%23Wind%20force%20scale">gale-force winds</a> on December 29. Upon doing so, it was upgraded to a tropical cyclone and given the name Waka. Shortly thereafter, the storm underwent <a href="Rapid%20deepening">rapid intensification</a>; roughly 24 hours after being named, Waka attained sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). During December 30, the center of the storm brushed <a href="Wallis%20and%20Futuna">Wallis Island</a> before turning towards the southeast and accelerating due to an approaching trough from the northwest. Continuing to intensify, Waka passed directly over <a href="Niuafo%27ou">Niuafo'ou</a> on December 31 with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). Later that day, the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">Category 4 severe tropical cyclone</a> with ten-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 km/h) and a <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of 930 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 27.46 <a href="Inches%20of%20Mercury">inHg</a>). The JTWC assessed the storm to have attained similar one-minute sustained winds upon peaking; however, this was due to discrepancies between the two warning centers. At this time, Waka displayed a well-defined, circular <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> roughly in diameter. Shortly after attaining its peak intensity, the center of Waka passed over Vava'u.

Continuing into the new year, Waka gradually weakened on January 1, 2002 as it entered a less favorable region for tropical cyclones. As a result, wind shear displaced <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> from the center and its <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eyewall</a> broke apart. Moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures, Waka began to undergo an <a href="Extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical transition</a>, which it completed on January 2. Tracking southeastward, the remnant cyclone briefly slowed over open waters before again accelerating. Over the following few days, the system gradually weakened, with sustained winds decreasing below gale-force by January 5. The storm was last noted on January 6 near the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>, about north-northwest of <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, at which time it had a pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.7 inHg).

On December 30, just a day before Waka passed through Tonga, warnings were issued for numerous islands, including parts of <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> and <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a>. Forecasts showed the storm passing directly over the low-lying Tongan capital of <a href="Nuku%27alofa">Nuku'alofa</a> as a <a href="SSHS%23Category%203">Category 3 cyclone</a>. Owing to warnings from local media, all <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> celebrations were canceled as residents and tourists boarded up their homes. All airports in the region were shut down and ferry service was suspended. Many residents on the small island of <a href="Niuafo%27ou">Niuafo'ou</a>, about 35 km (13.5 mi) in size, evacuated to other islands prior to Waka's arrival.
When the storm was moving through the islands of Tonga at peak strength, a few islands recorded <a href="Wind%23Wind%20force%20scale">hurricane-force winds</a>; the city of <a href="Neiafu%20%28Vava%27u%29">Neiafu</a> measured the strongest winds, peaking at 185 km/h (115 mph). In the southern islands, wind gusts up to 250 km/h (155 mph) affected isolated areas. In the <a href="Ha%CA%BBapai">Haʻapai</a> islands, sustained winds reached 100 km/h (65 mph) and gusted to 140 km/h (85 mph). Heavy rains also fell during Waka's passage, amounting to over in Haʻapai.

Initial reports from Nukuʻalofa on December 31 indicated severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses. Following the passage of Waka, communication with <a href="Niuas">Niuas</a> and <a href="Vava%27u">Vava'u</a> were lost. According to local reports, high winds sandblasted Neiafu and downed nearly every tree. Surveys by the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> revealed that roughly 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs. Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as <a href="taro">taro</a>, yams and bananas. In Ha'apai, one person died from <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a> brought on by the storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on <a href="Niuatoputapu">Niuatoputapu</a> where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> and several structures lost their roofs. In one instance, a <a href="yacht">yacht</a> was brought onshore by the surge and crashed into a restaurant, destroying both.

According to damage surveys, 13 of the country's islands sustained damage; 470 homes and 6 schools were destroyed and hundreds more damaged. Damage throughout Tonga amounted to 104.2 million <a href="Tongan%20pa%CA%BBanga">paʻanga</a> ($51.3 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). In addition to infrastructural and public damage, the environment sustained catastrophic losses on Tonga. The <a href="Insular%20Flying%20Fox">Insular Flying Fox</a> ("Pteropus tonganus"), a native species of bat, suffered great losses from Waka. Compared to pre-cyclone population levels, 79.8% (±9.9%) of the species was killed across six islands. This was due to widespread destruction of their natural food source, which decreased by 85% (±11.8%) following Waka. Trees across Vava'u were completely <a href="defoliation">defoliated</a>, although only 6.6% were killed, leaving no food for the bats. The greatest decline in bats was on <a href="Utula%27aina%20Island">Utula'aina Island</a> at 95.7%; <a href="A%27a%20Island">A'a Island</a> sustained a complete loss of food-bearing plants. Six months after the storm, the bat population in Vava'u was still only 20% of the pre-storm level.

During the cyclone's formative stages, it brought significant winds and swells to <a href="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>, resulting in localized flooding and crop damage. <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a> also experienced heavy rains, amounting to , and gusts up to . The winds downed a few trees and caused minor crop damage, with losses amounting to US$120,000. Large swells affected the island for roughly a week as the storm developed and moved away from the region. Cyclone Waka also affected <a href="Wallis%20and%20Futuna">Wallis and Futuna</a>, prompting <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings">tropical cyclone watches and warnings</a> from December 28 to 31, and later impacted <a href="Niue">Niue</a>, prompting warnings there from December 30 to January 1. On <a href="Wallis%20Island">Wallis Island</a>, one home was destroyed and 50% of the banana crop was lost. A maximum of of rain fell in <a href="Hihifo%20Airport">Hihifo</a> during the passage of Waka. A wind gust of and <a href="Swell%20%28ocean%29">swells</a> up to were recorded in Wallis. Niue received more significant damage, experiencing a storm surge of up to and sea spray up to inland. Numerous fallen trees and power lines blocked roads and left southern areas of the island without power for roughly six hours. Damage in Niue amounted to US$10,000.

After moving through the Tongan islands, the remnants of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the <a href="North%20Island">North Island</a> of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in <a href="Whangamata">Whangamata</a>, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 people out of the water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made. <a href="Rip%20current">Rip current</a>s also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.

Within a day of Cyclone Waka's passage in Tonga, the <a href="Government%20of%20New%20Zealand">Government of New Zealand</a> deployed an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent in accordance with the <a href="France%20%E2%80%93%20New%20Zealand%20relations%23The%20%26quot%3BFRANZ%26quot%3B%20agreement">FRANZ Agreement</a>, enacted in 1992, which states that assets from one country would be used in relief operations. On January 2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January 7, the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n <a href="AC-130">AC-130</a> to help with the recovery process. On January 12, a <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130 Hercules</a> carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.

Further funds came from the <a href="United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">United States Agency for International Development</a>, which offered US$25,000 by mid-January. The <a href="French%20Polynesia">French Polynesia</a>n assembly in <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> also provided US$770,000 worth of relief supplies and aid. The main industry of Tonga, tourism, was devastated by the storm as no tourists were allowed to travel to the region for at least two weeks after Waka's passage. The <a href="Government%20of%20Tonga">Government of Tonga</a> requested a total of US$39.2 million in international aid, most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure. Medical supplies and personnel were later deployed by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>. In early March, a relief fund based on donations was set up by the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Committee%20on%20Relief">United Methodist Committee on Relief</a> to provide US$210,000 for 30 families impacted by the storm. About 180 people were given assistance in rebuilding their homes by the <a href="Church%20World%20Service">Church World Service</a> later that month. As food shortages became severe in April, emergency supplies were sent to the outlying Niuas islands of Tonga. In May, US$5.85 million was approved for emergency funds by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation.

Vava'u suffered a tremendous decrease in agricultural exports due to Waka, dropping 86.5% from the previous year. Despite substantial agricultural losses, the sector ended up expanding roughly 2% by the end of 2002 and the overall economy grew by 2.9%. Owing to the severity of damage wrought by the cyclone, the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming%23Retirement">retired</a> the name Waka following its using.
