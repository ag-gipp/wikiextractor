Liberty Head double eagle

The Liberty Head double eagle or Coronet double eagle is an American twenty-dollar gold piece struck as a <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a> in 1849, and for commerce from 1850 to 1907. It was designed by <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a> Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>.

The largest denomination of United States coin authorized by the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201792">Mint Act of 1792</a> was the <a href="eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagle</a>, or ten-dollar piece. The large amount of bullion being brought east after the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">discovery of gold</a> in California in the 1840s caused Congress to consider new denominations of gold coinage. The <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> and <a href="double%20eagle">double eagle</a> were the result. After considerable infighting at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, Chief Engraver James B. Longacre designed the double eagle, and it began to be issued for commerce in 1850. Only one 1849 double eagle is known to survive and it rests in the <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">National Numismatic Collection</a> at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian</a>.

The coin was immediately successful; merchants and banks used it in trade. It was struck until replaced by the <a href="Saint-Gaudens%20double%20eagle">Saint-Gaudens double eagle</a> in 1907, and many were melted when President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> <a href="Executive%20Order%206102">recalled gold coins</a> from the public in 1933. Millions of double eagles were sent overseas in international transactions throughout its run to be melted or placed in bank vaults. Many of the latter have now been repatriated to feed the demand from collectors and those who desire to hold gold.

Under the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201792">Mint Act of 1792</a>, the largest-denomination coin was the gold <a href="Eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagle</a>, or ten-dollar piece. Also struck were a <a href="half%20eagle">half eagle</a> ($5) and <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> ($2.50). Bullion flowed out of the United States for economic reasons for much of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The eagle's size made it convenient for use in international transactions, and, faced with the likelihood that most being struck were exported, the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a> <a href="Elias%20Boudinot">Elias Boudinot</a> ended its production in 1804. In 1838, coinage resumed after Congress revised the weight and fineness of American gold coins. The new eagle was struck to a design by <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>, who was one of the Mint's engravers.

In 1836, the <a href="Public%20Ledger%20%28Philadelphia%29">"Public Ledger"</a>, a Philadelphia newspaper, proposed the issuance of both a gold dollar and a twenty-dollar piece; they wrote of the latter, "Twenty [silver dollars] are an encumbrance in a pocket ... if we are to have larger coins, let them be of gold. Along with the eagle, which has the size of the half dollar, we would recommend the double eagle, which [would be] of the size of our silver dollar, [and] would contain the value of twenty." Others perceived a need for a large U.S. gold coin to be used in international transactions—American merchants sometimes used high-denomination Latin American gold coins for that purpose.

No proposal for a gold twenty-dollar piece was considered until after the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, beginning in 1848, greatly increased the amount of the metal available in the United States. The increase in the supply of gold caused silver coins to be worth more than their face value, and they were heavily exported, generating new support for a gold dollar to take their place in commerce. The quantity of gold made a larger denomination desirable as well, to more efficiently convert gold to coins. In January 1849, North Carolina Congressman <a href="James%20Iver%20McKay">James Iver McKay</a> amended his previously introduced legislation for a gold dollar to provide for a double eagle as well. He wrote to Mint Director <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a>, who responded, "there can be no other objection to the Double eagle except that it is not needed. It will be a handsome coin, between the half dollar and dollar in size."

Concerned about likely <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> opposition to the coinage bill, McKay got his fellow Democrat, New Hampshire Senator <a href="Charles%20G.%20Atherton">Charles Atherton</a>, to introduce the bill in the Senate on February 1, 1849—Atherton was chairman of the <a href="Senate%20Finance%20Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a>. McKay introduced a version of the bill into the House on February 20; debate began the same day. The dollar was attacked on the ground it would be too small; the double eagle on the claim that it would be heavily abraded in circulation, and would become lightweight. McKay did not respond substantively, but stated that if no one wanted these denominations, they would be unasked-for at the Mint, and would not be coined. Pennsylvania Representative <a href="Joseph%20Ingersoll">Joseph Ingersoll</a>, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations. Ingersoll stated that a twenty-dollar piece would be "doubled into a ponderous and unparalleled size". Nevertheless, the bill providing for the issuance of the gold dollar and double eagle passed both houses by large margins, and was signed into law by President <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a> on March 3, 1849. According to numismatist David Lange, "the double eagle was a banker's coin intended to simplify transfers of large sums between financial institutions and between nations".

The act authorizing the gold dollar and double eagle precipitated conflict at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>. There the officers, including Chief Coiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>, were mostly the friends and relations of Director Patterson. The outsider in their midst was Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, successor to Gobrecht (who had died in 1844). A former copper-plate engraver, Longacre had been appointed through the political influence of South Carolina Senator <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>. Patterson despised Calhoun, and Longacre became a loner at the mint. Most of Peale's formal duties were performed by his predecessor, <a href="Adam%20Eckfeldt">Adam Eckfeldt</a>, who continued to do the work of chief coiner despite his retirement. Peale spent the resulting free time running a private medal business taking commissions from the public and using the government's facilities, including its Contamin <a href="reducing%20lathe">portrait lathe</a>. This machine, used in Peale's medal work, was needed to reduce models of new designs to coin-sized reductions from which working dies could be made. So long as no new coin designs were needed, dies could be reproduced mechanically, without using the Contamin device. Although it belonged to his department, Longacre did not use the Contamin lathe much until Congress ordered that the two new coins be struck.

When Longacre began work on the two new coins in early 1849, he had no assistants. He completed work on the gold dollar first, anxious to show that he could create a coin design. In May, he requested that Patterson hire another engraver to assist him. The director declined, willing only to have engraving work contracted out. This was unsatisfactory to Longacre, who was responsible under the law for the proper execution of coinage dies, and who could not supervise outside work.

As Longacre worked on the double eagle design, according to numismatist <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, "Peale, with Patterson's tacit approval, began harassment." Longacre prepared a large model of the new coin in wax and was instructed to give it to Peale for use in preparing a metal <a href="electrotyping">galvano</a>, which could be used in the lathe. The operation failed, and Longacre's model was destroyed. Longacre had, however, made a cast of his model in plaster, and was able to use it in the machine. The resulting steel die had to be hardened in Peale's department; as Longacre put it, "it unluckily split in the process". According to numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, "Peale's adoption of a process not normally used at the Mint, together with its catastrophic failures, seems more than coincidental".

Longacre set forth on a third attempt to create a die. He was hampered not only by the continued opposition of Peale but by poor lighting and the noxious fumes that penetrated his office at the Philadelphia Mint. A friend, New York engraver <a href="Charles%20Cushing%20Wright">Charles Cushing Wright</a>, arranged for <a href="Peter%20Cross%20%28engraver%29">Peter F. Cross</a> to assist Longacre with making hubs and dies. Cross made the first obverse die in November and December 1849 at Longacre's direction, and the chief engraver made the reverse. On December 22, 1849, Patterson wrote to Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20M.%20Meredith">William M. Meredith</a> that the dies were completed. He enclosed a double eagle, asking Meredith, if he approved of the piece, to send word as quickly as possible to allow the coinage of 1849 double eagles in quantity. Before any reply could be received, Peale objected on December 24, complaining that the relief of the head of Liberty was so high that pieces struck using the Philadelphia Mint's steam-powered machinery could not fully bring out the design—the coin sent to Meredith had been coined on a medal press, by hand. In addition, Peale alleged that the head was in such high relief that the coins would not stack. Patterson sent Peale's letter to Meredith on December 25, noting that this meant there would be a lengthy delay.

Longacre completed the lower-relief dies about January 12, 1850. Peale did not test them for two weeks; when he did, he rejected them, stating that Liberty's head opposed the eagle on the reverse, making it difficult for the full design to be brought forth. He stated that Longacre would have to move the position of the head. Longacre, outraged, appealed to Director Patterson, who took no action, but early the next month came to see Longacre in his office. He told the engraver that the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Zachary%20Taylor">Taylor administration</a> (which had taken office in March 1849) had decided on Longacre's removal, and urged him to send in his resignation as quickly as possible. Longacre did not resign but went to Washington to see Secretary Meredith. He found that Patterson had lied to Meredith about a number of matters. For example, when Longacre took a new double eagle from his pocket, Meredith expressed surprise, believing that the dies from which it had been made had been broken. Longacre kept his job.

According to numismatic author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, Longacre's last set of dies were completed in February 1850, and were accepted. Breen, however, stated that the first production coins appeared about January 26, 1850. Only one 1849 double eagle is known to be extant; it forms part of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">National Numismatic Collection</a>. The specimen sent to Meredith is unlocated, and is said to have been owned in the 1950s by coin dealer William K. Nagy, whose former business partner John W. Haseltine supposedly acquired it from the Meredith estate. Nagy allegedly stated that he had sold the coin to a private collector. One 1849 piece, in gilt brass, was later struck for Philadelphia druggist and numismatist Robert Coulton Davis, who had close ties to the Mint. Its location is also unknown.

The obverse depicts a head of Liberty in the Greco-Roman style, facing left, with her hair pulled back—according to numismatists Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, "attractively"—in a bun. Some of her hair descends the back of her neck. She wears a coronet, inscribed "Liberty", and is surrounded by thirteen stars, representative of the original states, and the year of issue. The reverse features a <a href="spreadeagle%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic eagle</a>, holding a double ribbon, on which "<a href="E%20Pluribus%20Unum">E Pluribus Unum</a>" is inscribed. The double ribbon is an allusion by Longacre to the denomination of the piece he was designing. The design is a variant on the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20United%20States">Great Seal of the United States</a>; the eagle protects a shield, which represents the nation, and holds an olive branch and arrows. Above the bird, Longacre again placed thirteen stars, arranged as a halo, together with an arc of rays.

Longacre's initials, JBL, appear on the truncation of the head. The gold dollar and twenty-dollar piece were the first American federal coins on which the designer's initials appear—on the gold dollar, only the "L" is used. Longacre's designs for the double eagle and the Type I gold dollar (1849–1854) are similar.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> disliked the double eagle and other Longacre coins showing Liberty, calling them routine. He did find that the reverse "has some commendable points of heraldic imagery" and likened that side of the coin to "the frontispiece for a patriotic brochure". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Alta%20California">The Daily Alta California</a>" in May 1850 reprinted a piece from an unnamed Eastern newspaper, which said of the new piece, "we cannot say that we admire it ... [the eagle on the reverse is] imperfectly formed, and marred by some adjacent flummery intended for radiance we suppose, by which the whole thing is rendered confused". "<a href="The%20Journal%20of%20Commerce">The Journal of Commerce</a>", a New York periodical, suggested that the piece be replaced with one showing <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> on one side and on the other "a handsome eagle standing out as if it were not ashamed of itself". The "<a href="Boston%20Evening%20Transcript">Boston Evening Transcript</a>" suggested that Mint authorities should be "stopping the issuance of this very shabby coin. The manager of the mint would seem to be utterly destitute of taste to allow such a specimen to go forth." Bowers, writing in 2004, stated that despite the negative contemporary reaction, the design of the double eagle is now very popular among collectors.

The double eagle soon became the most popular gold coin in terms of the number of pieces struck. During the denomination's life, from 1850 to 1933, far more gold was struck into double eagles than into all other denominations combined. Of all gold coins struck from the start of gold coinage for circulation in 1795 to the end in 1933, just under half of the coins struck were double eagles, but 78% of the gold used was struck into twenty-dollar pieces. According to Bowers, the double eagle "represented the most efficient way to coin a given quantity of gold bullion into coin form".

Regular production of the double eagle began with the striking of just over a million at Philadelphia in 1850, and 141,000 at the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mint">New Orleans Mint</a> that year. Double eagles were struck at New Orleans every year from 1850 to 1861, generally in small quantities. In the early years of the Liberty Head double eagle, when no mint was in the Far West, some California gold was presented there for coining into double eagles. Once the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> opened in 1854, New Orleans mintages were light as for the most part only local gold was deposited, and there was not much of it. The Philadelphia Mint continued to receive much of the California gold. After Louisiana seceded from the Union in 1861, some of the double eagles from New Orleans that year, though bearing the standard designs, were struck under the authority of the State of Louisiana, and later, the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. That mint then closed, reopening in 1879. The branch mints at <a href="Charlotte%20Mint">Charlotte</a> and <a href="Dahlonega%20Mint">Dahlonega</a>, which also closed with the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, had limited coinage facilities, and struck no denomination higher than a half eagle.

A shortage of gold coins occurred in California and the Far West in the early 1850s; federal authorities refused to accept gold dust for payment of customs duties and private minters soon stepped into the breach. California Senator <a href="William%20M.%20Gwin">William Gwin</a> proposed legislation to establish assay offices in California and for the issuance of high-denomination gold coins, as large as $10,000. Although most of his proposals were defeated, an assay office was established at San Francisco. Nevertheless, two waves of panic related to money roiled California, and in 1852, Congress established the San Francisco Mint. The first double eagle was coined there on April 3, 1854; struck in proof condition, that piece is now part of the National Numismatic Collection. Just over half of the double eagles struck between 1850 and 1933 were minted at San Francisco.

Many of the high-grade San Francisco Type I double eagles known today were taken from shipwrecks, where they had rested for over a century. These ships included the SS "Brother Jonathan", the <a href="SS%20Central%20America">SS "Central America"</a>, and the SS "Yankee Blade". Thousands of almost-pristine 1857 double eagles struck at San Francisco (1857-S) went down with the "Central America" when it sank off the East Coast of the United States that September, as did some 435 people, including Captain <a href="William%20Herndon%20%28naval%20officer%29">William Herndon</a>. The cargo was salvaged beginning in the 1980s; once litigation over its ownership was settled, the pieces were marketed to the public. The "Brother Jonathan", a luxurious <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> en route from San Francisco north to Portland, sank in July 1865; few survived the wreck. The thousands of double eagles and other coins on board were salvaged beginning in 1996, and once litigation concluded, many <a href="mint%20state">mint state</a> double eagles came on the market.

The word "LIBERTY" on double eagles between 1850 and 1858 was originally spelled "LLBERTY" by Longacre, who converted the second L into an I; this is visible under magnification. In 1860, Assistant Engraver <a href="Anthony%20C.%20Paquet">Anthony C. Paquet</a> completed a revision of the reverse, with taller, narrower letters. After production had begun in early 1861 at Philadelphia and San Francisco, it was noticed that the design lacked a rim high enough to protect the design from abrasion, and the Mint went back to the old reverse. Only a handful of the Philadelphia specimens were not melted, but by the time word reached San Francisco to stop production, the western mint had issued 20,000 pieces. A Philadelphia specimen sold at auction for $1,610,000 in August 2006, setting a record for the Liberty Head double eagle series. In February 2013, an 1866-S double eagle with no motto was discovered in the <a href="Saddle%20Ridge%20Hoard">Saddle Ridge Hoard</a> in the <a href="Gold%20Country">Gold Country</a> on the western slope of the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> in California. Only a very small number of <a href="proof%20coin">proof coin</a>s in the Liberty Head double eagle series were struck for sale to the public, beginning in 1858, at Philadelphia; Breen noted, "few collectors could afford them even then".

With the nation in the midst of an internal war, in November 1861, Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> received a proposal that American coinage bear an expression of faith in God. After various wordings were considered, "<a href="In%20God%20we%20trust">In God We Trust</a>" was placed on the new <a href="two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%29">two-cent piece</a> in 1864. The Act of March 3, 1865, that authorized the <a href="three-cent%20nickel">copper-nickel three-cent piece</a> also required the motto to appear on all coins large enough to bear it. Pursuant to this mandate, Longacre began re-engraving the various denominations of U.S. coinage. In 1866, he added "In God We Trust" to all coins that did not already have it, excepting the pieces smaller in diameter than the <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickel</a>, a coin which began to be struck that year. The San Francisco Mint used up leftover double eagle reverse dies from 1865 before switching over during 1866.

Longacre made the required addition to the double eagle by slightly enlarging the circle of stars on the reverse, and placing the motto within it. He took the opportunity to make other changes to the double eagle. The shield on the reverse was given <a href="rococo">rococo</a> sides; previously they had been straight. A ninth leaf was added to the olive branch, and the shape of the leaves was changed. The <a href="finial">finial</a>s of the scroll were made smaller though more elaborate—on the left-hand scroll, the finials impinge less on the letters "ibus" in "Pluribus" than before. The eagle's wings and tail feathers were also slightly elongated.

In 1870, the <a href="Carson%20City%20Mint">Carson City Mint</a> opened in Nevada at the urging of silver mining interests, so that ore could be refined and converted to coin locally. In addition to silver, it struck gold half eagles, eagles, and double eagles. The 1870-CC double eagle, like other coins from that mint's first year of operations, is a great rarity—only 3,789 were struck. One sold for $414,000 at auction in March 2009. Carson City double eagles circulated for the most part only locally, since they were only struck in response to the deposit of gold bullion and the request of the depositor that it be coined into twenty-dollar pieces. Heavy production of the coin occurred in San Francisco and satisfied the needs of Californians and those in the export trade. As gold did not circulate in the East, most Philadelphia pieces of this era were either sent west, or exported and melted.

In November 1872, Chief Engraver <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a>, Longacre's successor, submitted a set of <a href="logotype">logotype</a>s to show how the following year's date would appear on the coinage. They were approved, but on January 18, 1873, Chief Coiner <a href="A.%20Loudon%20Snowden">A. Loudon Snowden</a> filed a written complaint, stating that the "3" in the date too closely resembled an "8". Barber was ordered to redo his work; this decision affected most denominations of U.S. coins. The differences between the "Closed 3" and "Open 3" on the double eagle are small. One difference is that on the Closed 3, the two knobs on the "3" are equal in size; on the Open 3, the upper one is somewhat smaller. All Carson City and most San Francisco issues from that year are Closed 3.

In 1876, William Barber altered the double eagle's reverse, emboldening "In God We Trust". The two varieties are known as the "Heavy Motto" and "Light Motto" types. He made more extensive changes for the following year's production. He truncated Liberty's neck at a sharper angle to allow more space for the date, which was punched into the dies by hand. In Longacre's original version, the tip of Liberty's coronet is very close to the seventh star clockwise from the date; beginning in 1877, it points between the sixth and seventh stars. A more noticeable change was made to the reverse, where the denomination, formerly "Twenty D.", was spelled out as "Twenty Dollars". The phrase "E Pluribus Unum", on the ribbon that the eagle bears, was enlarged. The new dies initially created difficulties at the Mint and Barber made minor adjustments to the design over the first few months of production.

Many double eagles were struck at San Francisco between 1877 and 1883. Beginning in 1881, mintage of double eagles at Philadelphia was sharply curtailed. For the seven years 1881–1887, only 4,521 were made at that mint for circulation, none being struck in 1882, 1883, and 1887. They were struck yearly in proof at Philadelphia: the 1883 (mintage 92), 1884 (71) and 1887 (121) are great rarities. The mintage of 2,325 at New Orleans in 1879, the only postwar strikings there, is unexplained—Breen suggested that the local mint superintendent might have anticipated demand for the denomination. Double eagles were unpopular in commerce in the South, as were eagles. Millions of double eagles were sent to Europe as payment in international transactions beginning in the 1880s, often in cloth bags containing 250 coins, for a total of $5,000 per bag.
In 1900, William Barber's successor as chief engraver, his son <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins about that time suggest that he most likely did it as part of a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.

The 1891 discovery of gold at <a href="Cripple%20Creek%2C%20Colorado">Cripple Creek, Colorado</a>, in 1891 led to a gold rush there. The greater availability of gold in Colorado was one reason the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a> was authorized in 1904—it opened in 1906. About a dozen proofs were struck for presentation to dignitaries when production of double eagles was inaugurated at Denver on April 4, 1906.

In 1904, President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> complained to his Secretary of the Treasury, <a href="Leslie%20M.%20Shaw">Leslie M. Shaw</a>, about the designs on American coinage, and enquired if a sculptor such as the President's friend, <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>, could be hired to provide beautiful, up-to-date designs.

The following year, the Mint hired Saint-Gaudens to create new designs for the four gold pieces then being struck, as well as the cent. Other commissions delayed him, and as he became more ill with the cancer that would kill him, his work slowed. Chief Engraver Barber repeatedly objected to the design Saint-Gaudens finally submitted, which shows Liberty striding across a rocky outcrop, on the grounds that its relief was too high. After Saint-Gaudens's death on August 3, 1907, Barber produced his own, low-relief version of Saint-Gaudens's coin. Its striking began in late 1907, and it entered commerce that December—thereby putting an end to the Liberty Head double eagle series.

Large quantities of double eagles were melted in the 1930s by the government after <a href="Executive%20Order%206102">they were called</a> in under President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. Although many of the double eagles exported in bulk in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were melted—records show that most sent to the United Kingdom were recoined into <a href="sovereign%20%28British%20coin%29">sovereigns</a>—millions remained in banks. Large quantities of double eagles were found in the vaults of European banks beginning in the 1940s, and were placed on the numismatic market. Many common and low-grade Liberty Head double eagles have been sold as investments, valued based on their bullion content. Type I double eagles have been recovered from shipwrecks, bringing many high-grade early specimens onto the market, with the romance of "treasure coins" increasing the public demand.

In the 19th century, double eagles were little collected. Numismatists did not yet consider mint-marked coins to be distinct from those without. Even proof coins—with mintages in the dozens or low hundreds—sold on the secondary market at a slight increase from face value, and probably many were spent in hard times. In 1909, early numismatic writer <a href="Edgar%20H.%20Adams">Edgar H. Adams</a> published a catalog of American gold issues. No Liberty Head double eagle was considered by Adams to be worth more than the value inscribed on it.

As it became clear in the 1940s that the withdrawal of gold coins in 1933 had left several late-date Saint-Gaudens double eagles unexpectedly rare, collector interest grew in the denomination. The massive importation of double eagles held overseas once Americans were allowed to own gold again in 1974 added to the supply, but according to numismatic writer and coin dealer Bowers, "today they are of such wide popularity, fascination, and interest that the record prices achieved [at an important sale in 1949] seem like incredible bargains!"

There are many ways to collect Liberty Head double eagles. Some, wishing only a few pieces, may choose one each of the three major types, or seek pieces from the five mints that struck them. Carson City double eagles are highly popular. As the 1870-CC is almost unobtainable, collectors may limit themselves to Carson City Type III pieces (1877–1893). Collectors seeking one double eagle per year of mintage will find it expensive to fill the 1886 entry, a year in which double eagles were only struck at Philadelphia, and just 1,000 business strikes and 106 proof pieces were issued. The 2015 edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists the 1886 in <a href="coin%20grading">Very Fine</a> condition (VF-20) at $22,500.

Grace Sherwood

Grace White Sherwood (1660–1740), called the Witch of Pungo, is the last person known to have been convicted of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a> in <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a>. A farmer, healer, and midwife, she was accused by her neighbors of <a href="shapeshifting">transforming herself</a> into a cat, damaging crops, and causing the death of livestock. She was charged with witchcraft several times; at her trial in 1706, Sherwood was accused of bewitching her neighbor, Elizabeth Hill, causing Hill to <a href="miscarriage">miscarry</a>. The court ordered that Sherwood's guilt or innocence be determined by <a href="Trial%20by%20ordeal%23Witch-hunts">ducking</a> her in water. If she sank, she was innocent; if she did not, she was guilty. Sherwood floated to the surface and may have spent almost eight years in jail before being released.

Sherwood lived in <a href="Pungo%2C%20Virginia">Pungo</a>, <a href="Princess%20Anne%20County%2C%20Virginia">Princess Anne County</a> (today part of <a href="Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Virginia Beach</a>), and married James Sherwood, a <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">planter</a>, in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. Her first case was in 1697; she was accused of casting a <a href="spell%20%28paranormal%29">spell</a> on a bull, resulting in its death, but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton crop of one of them. Sherwood sued for <a href="defamation">slander</a> after each accusation, but her lawsuits were unsuccessful and her husband had to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County (her husband had died in 1701). She did not remarry, and lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80.

On July 10, 2006, the 300th anniversary of Sherwood's conviction, <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">Governor</a> <a href="Tim%20Kaine">Tim Kaine</a> granted an informal <a href="pardon">pardon</a> to "officially restore [her] good name", recognizing that she was wrongfully convicted. A statue depicting her was erected near <a href="Sentara%20Health%20System">Sentara Independence</a> on Independence Boulevard in Virginia Beach, close to the site of the colonial courthouse where she was tried. She is sculpted alongside a <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>, representing her love of animals, and carrying a basket containing <a href="garlic">garlic</a> and <a href="rosemary">rosemary</a>, in recognition of her knowledge of <a href="herbalism">herbal healing</a>.

Sherwood was born in 1660 to John and Susan White. John White was a carpenter and farmer of Scottish descent; it is uncertain whether he was born in America. Susan was English by birth; their daughter Grace was born in Virginia, probably in Pungo.

In April 1680 Grace White married a respected small-farm landowner, James Sherwood, in the <a href="Old%20Donation%20Episcopal%20Church">Lynnhaven Parish Church</a>. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. John White gave the Sherwoods of land when they married, and on his death in 1681 left them the remainder of his farm. The Sherwood family was poor, and lived in an area inhabited by small landowners or those with no land at all. In addition to farming, Grace Sherwood grew her own herbs, which she used to heal both people and animals. She also acted as a <a href="midwife">midwife</a>. When James died in 1701, Grace inherited his property. She did not remarry.

No drawings or paintings of Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing a sense of humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up in an effort to remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.

The existence of witches and demonic forces was taken for granted by the American colonists—<a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a> was considered the work of the <a href="Devil">Devil</a>. Colonists believed that witches could be identified by their strange behavior. As early as 1626, nineteen years after the founding of the <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown colony</a>, a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> in Virginia sat to consider whether Goodwife Joan Wright was a witch—she had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife. No record of the outcome is extant. Nevertheless, Virginia did not experience events of <a href="mass%20hysteria">mass hysteria</a> such as the <a href="Salem%20witch%20trials">Salem, Massachusetts witch trials</a> in 1692–1693, in which 19 people were executed on allegations of sorcery, some years before the first accusations against Sherwood. Ecclesiastical influence in the courtroom was much less a factor in Virginia, where the clergy rarely participated in witchcraft trials, than in New England, where ministers took an active part. People's fears of witchcraft in Virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, although the two often intermingled. <a href="Puritans%23New%20England%20Puritans">New England's Puritans</a> had settled in towns, and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions. There were few such towns in Virginia, where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations, connected by water transport and scattered over a large area.

Virginia's lay and religious leaders were more interested in prosecuting offenses such as gossip, slander, and fornication, seeing them as threats to social stability. They wished to avoid witchcraft prosecutions, which were divisive. Virginia courts were reluctant to hear accusations of witchcraft and were even more reluctant to convict. Unlike the Salem witch trial courts, where the accused had to prove her innocence, in Virginia courts the accuser carried the <a href="Legal%20burden%20of%20proof">burden of proof</a>. Further, Virginia courts generally ignored evidence said to have been obtained by <a href="ghost">supernatural</a> means, whereas the New England courts were known to convict people based solely on it. Virginia required proof of guilt through either searches for <a href="witches%27%20mark">witch's marks</a> or <a href="cucking%20stool">ducking</a>. Judges and magistrates would dismiss unsubstantiated cases of witchcraft and allow the accusers, who found themselves "under an ill tongue", to be sued for slander. Frances Pollard of the <a href="Virginia%20Historical%20Society">Virginia Historical Society</a> states: "It was pretty clear that Virginia early on tried to discourage these charges being brought of witchcraft because they were so troublesome." The <a href="Tidewater%20region">southeastern corner</a> of Virginia, around present-day <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk</a> and Virginia Beach (where Pungo is located), saw more accusations of witchcraft than other areas. According to Leslie M. Newman, this may have been due to local poverty as there was no cultural elite to restrain such prosecutions.

Although few Virginia records survive from that era, 19 known witchcraft cases were brought in the colony during the 17th century, all but one of which ended in acquittal. The one conviction was a 1656 case of a man convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to 10 <a href="flagellation">stripes</a> and banishment from the county. There were no executions for witchcraft in Virginia. Nonetheless, as late as in 1736, Virginia's <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justices of the peace</a> were reminded that witchcraft was still a crime, and that first offenders could expect to be <a href="pillory">pilloried</a> and jailed for up to a year. In 1745, John Craig, a Presbyterian minister in <a href="Augusta%20County%2C%20Virginia">Augusta County</a>, made assertions of witchcraft after his child and several of his animals died, and was in response accused of using evil arts to <a href="divination">divine</a> who was responsible. Neither he nor those who accused him brought their claims to court to face "unsympathetic magistrates", though prosecution for witchcraft was still possible in Virginia. The last Virginia witchcraft trial took place in 1802 in <a href="Brooke%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Brooke County</a>, which is now in <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. In that case, a couple claimed that a woman was a witch, an accusation ruled slanderous.

The trial by ducking (immersing the accused, bound, in water, to see if she would float) appears to have been used only once in Virginia, to try Sherwood. It was believed that, as water was considered pure, it would reject witches, causing them to float, whereas the innocent would sink.

The first accusation against Sherwood came to court in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged that she had used a spell to cause the death of his bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a <a href="Black%20cat%23Historical%20associations">black cat</a>, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.

According to Richard Beale Davis in his journal article on witchcraft in Virginia, by this time "Princess Anne County had obviously grown tired of Mrs. Sherwood as a general nuisance". In 1705, Sherwood was involved in a fight with her neighbor, Elizabeth Hill. Sherwood sued Hill and her husband for assault and battery, and on December 7, 1705, was awarded damages of twenty shillings (one <a href="pound%20sterling">pound sterling</a>). 

On January 3, 1706, the Hills accused Grace Sherwood of witchcraft. She failed to answer the charge in court, and on February 7, 1706, the court ordered her to appear on a charge of having bewitched Elizabeth Hill, causing a miscarriage. In March 1706 the Princess Anne County justices sought to empanel two juries, both made up of women. The first was ordered to search Sherwood's home for waxen or baked figures that might indicate she was a witch. The second was ordered to look for "demon suckling teats" by examining her. In both instances, reluctance on the part of the local residents made it difficult to form a jury and both juries refused to carry out the searches. On March 7, 1706, Sherwood was examined by a jury of 12 "ancient and knowing women" appointed to look for markings on her body that might be brands of the Devil. They discovered two "marks not like theirs or like those of any other woman". The forewoman of this jury was the same Elizabeth Barnes who had previously accused Sherwood of witchcraft.

Neither the colonial authorities in Williamsburg nor the local court in Princess Anne were willing to declare Sherwood a witch. Those in Williamsburg considered the charge overly vague, and on April 16 instructed the local court to examine the case more fully. For each court appearance, Sherwood had to travel from her farm in Pungo to where the court was sitting.

On May 2, 1706, the county justices noted that while no particular act of <a href="maleficium%20%28sorcery%29">maleficium</a> had been alleged against Sherwood, there was "great cause of suspicion". Consequently, the Sheriff of Princess Anne County took Sherwood into custody, though Sherwood could give bond for her appearance and good behavior. Maximilian Boush, a <a href="churchwarden">warden</a> of Lynnhaven Parish Church, was the prosecutor in Sherwood's case. On July 5, 1706, the justices ordered a trial by ducking to take place, with Sherwood's consent, but heavy rains caused a postponement until July 10, as they feared the wet weather might harm her health. Sherwood was taken inside Lynnhaven Parish Church, placed on a stool and ordered to ask for forgiveness for her witchery. She replied, "I be not a witch, I be a healer."
At about 10 a.m. on July 10, 1706, Sherwood was taken down a dirt lane now known as Witchduck Road, to a plantation near the mouth of the <a href="Lynnhaven%20River">Lynnhaven River</a>. News had spread, and the event attracted people from all over the colony, who began to shout "Duck the witch!" According to the principles of trial by water, if Sherwood floated she would be deemed guilty of witchcraft; if she did not, she would be innocent. It was not intended that Sherwood drown; the court had ordered that care be taken to preserve her life.

Five women of Lynnhaven Parish Church examined Sherwood's naked body on the shoreline for any devices she might have to free herself, and then covered her with a sack. Six of the justices that had ordered the ducking rowed in one boat out in the river, and in another were the sheriff, the magistrate, and Sherwood. Just before she was pushed off the boat Sherwood is said to have stated, under clear skies, "Before this day be through you will all get a worse ducking than I." Bound across the body—her right thumb to her left big toe and her left thumb to her right big toe – she was "cast into the river", and quickly floated to the surface. The sheriff then tied a Bible around her neck. This caused her to sink, but she untied herself, and returned to the surface, convincing many spectators she was a witch. As Sherwood was pulled out of the water a downpour reportedly started, drenching the onlookers. Several women who subsequently examined her for additional proof found "two <a href="supernumerary%20nipple">things like titts</a> on her private parts of a black coller [color]". She was jailed pending further proceedings.

What happened to Sherwood after her ducking is unclear as many court records have been lost. She served an unknown time in the jail next to Lynnhaven Parish Church, perhaps as long as seven years and nine months. She was ordered to be detained "to be brought to a future trial", but no record of another trial exists, so it is possible the charge was dismissed at some point. On September 1, 1708, she was ordered to pay Christopher Cocke of tobacco for a reason not indicated in surviving records, but there is no mention of the payment. She appears to have been released some time in or before 1714, since in that year she paid back taxes on her property—which <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Virginia">Virginia Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="Alexander%20Spotswood">Alexander Spotswood</a> helped her to recover from Princess Anne County—on the banks of Muddy Creek off what is now Muddy Creek Road. She lived the remainder of her life quietly until her death in 1740, aged about 80. She is believed to have died in August or September 1740. Her will was proved on October 1, 1740; it noted that she was a widow. She left five <a href="Shilling%23North%20America">shilling</a>s each to her sons James and Richard and everything else to her eldest son John.

According to legend, Sherwood's sons put her body near the fireplace, and a wind came down the chimney. Her body disappeared amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned several times in the 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of <a href="Back%20Bay%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge</a>.

Grace Sherwood's case was little known until Virginia Beach historian and author <a href="Louisa%20Venable%20Kyle">Louisa Venable Kyle</a> wrote a children's book about her in 1973. Called "The Witch of Pungo", it is a collection of seven local <a href="Folklore%20of%20the%20United%20States">folk tales</a> written as fiction, although based on historical events. Sherwood's story was adapted for "Cry Witch", a courtroom drama at <a href="Colonial%20Williamsburg">Colonial Williamsburg</a>, the restored early capital of Virginia.

A statue by California sculptor Robert Cunningham depicting Sherwood with a raccoon and a basket of rosemary was unveiled on April 21, 2007, on the site of the present-day Sentara Bayside Hospital, close to the sites of both the colonial courthouse and the ducking point. The raccoon represents Sherwood's love of animals and the rosemary her knowledge of herbal healing. A Virginia Department of Historic Resources marker (K-276) was erected in 2002, about from Sherwood's statue. The place of her watery test and the adjacent land are named Witch Duck Bay and Witch Duck Point. A portion of <a href="Virginia%20State%20Route%20190">Virginia State Route 190</a> in Virginia Beach, a north–south thoroughfare on its western side which traverses <a href="Interstate%20264%20%28Virginia%29">Interstate 264</a> at exit numbers 14–16, has been named "<a href="Virginia%20State%20Route%20190">Witchduck Road</a>". Other commemorations in Virginia Beach include Sherwood Lane and Witch Point Trail. In 2014, a memorial marker was placed at a herb garden of the <a href="Old%20Donation%20Episcopal%20Church">Old Donation Episcopal Church</a>, Sherwood's former parish church, which is in Virginia Beach. A local legend in Virginia Beach states that all of the rosemary growing there came from a single plant Sherwood carried in an eggshell from England.
Belinda Nash, in addition to writing a biography of Sherwood, worked tirelessly to get her pardoned. Governor <a href="Tim%20Kaine">Tim Kaine</a> granted an informal <a href="pardon">pardon</a> to "officially restore the good name of Grace Sherwood" on July 10, 2006, the 300th anniversary of her conviction. Annual reenactments of the ducking have taken place since 2006. No one is actually ducked in these events, which embark from a spot across from <a href="Ferry%20Plantation%20House">Ferry Plantation House</a> along Cheswick Lane, which is very close to Witch Duck Bay. According to local residents, a strange moving light, said to be Sherwood's restless spirit, still appears each July over the spot in Witch Duck Bay where Sherwood was thrown into the water.

Murder of Dwayne Jones

Dwayne Jones was a Jamaican 16-year-old who was killed by a <a href="mobbing">violent mob</a> in <a href="Montego%20Bay">Montego Bay</a> in 2013, after he attended a dance party dressed in women's clothing. The incident attracted national and international media attention and brought increased scrutiny to the status of <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Jamaica">LGBT rights in Jamaica</a>.

Perceived as <a href="effeminancy">effeminate</a>, Jones was <a href="bullying">bullied</a> in school and, at the age of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a derelict house in Montego Bay with <a href="transgender">transgender</a> friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the <a href="Irwin%2C%20Jamaica">Irwin</a> area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the <a href="cross-dressing">cross-dressing</a> Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died in the early hours of the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved.

The event made newspaper headlines in Jamaica and was also the subject of reporting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Jamaica">Justice Minister</a>. In the wake of the attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to <a href="LGBT%20rights%20by%20country">LGBT rights</a> and <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> – among them <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, <a href="Jamaicans%20for%20Justice">Jamaicans for Justice</a>, and the <a href="J-FLAG">Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays</a> – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island.

Raised in an impoverished slum in <a href="Montego%20Bay">Montego Bay</a>, a city in northwest Jamaica, Jones faced bullying at high school from students who perceived his behaviour as <a href="effeminacy">effeminate</a>. When Jones was 14, his father ejected him from the family home and encouraged neighbours to chase him out of the neighbourhood. After a period sleeping in bushes and on beaches, he began <a href="squatting">squatting</a> in a derelict house in the hills above Montego Bay with two transgender friends, Keke and Khloe, both 23 at the time of Jones' death. Jones was known among friends as "Gully Queen", a reference to the storm drainage systems in which many homeless LGBT Jamaicans live. Friends noted that Jones desired to become a teacher or to work in the <a href="Tourism%20in%20Jamaica">tourist industry</a>. He also wanted to become a performer like the American pop star <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a>, and had won a local dancing competition. Khloe described him as "a diva" who was "always very feisty and joking around".

In 2006, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine said that Jamaica may be the most <a href="homophobia">homophobic</a> country in the world. The country's <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Jamaica%23Laws%2C%20policies%2C%20and%20the%20Jamaican%20constitution">laws criminalising same-sex activity</a> between males were introduced in 1864, during the <a href="Colony%20of%20Jamaica">British colonial administration</a>. According to the <a href="Sexual%20Offences%20Act%20of%202009">Sexual Offences Act of 2009</a>, any man convicted under these laws must register as a <a href="sex%20offender">sex offender</a>. These laws have been cited as contributing to wider homophobic attitudes among the Jamaican populace, including the view that gay people are criminals regardless of whether or not they have committed any criminal act. Anti-LGBT perspectives have been furthered by the island's conservative Christian churches. Many <a href="reggae">reggae</a> and <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> songs, among them <a href="Buju%20Banton">Buju Banton</a>'s "Boom Bye Bye", call for the killing of gays. Writing for the "<a href="International%20Business%20Times">International Business Times</a>" in the summer of 2013, the journalist Palash Gosh noted that while Jamaica was "awash in crime and violence, gays and lesbians are particularly prominent targets of wanton brutality." In the mid-2000s, two of Jamaica's best-known LGBT rights activists, <a href="Brian%20Williamson">Brian Williamson</a> and <a href="Lenford%20Harvey">Steve Harvey</a>, were murdered. In the summer of 2013, <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> carried out five weeks of fieldwork among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half of those interviewed had experienced violence as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion.

On the evening of 21 July 2013 – when Jones was 16 – he dressed in female clothing and attended a dance party with Keke and Khloe called Henessey Sundays, held at a bar in the <a href="Irwin%2C%20Jamaica">Irwin</a> area. They arrived by taxi at around 2 am. Jones <a href="passing%20%28gender%29">passed</a> as a girl at the party, and several males danced with him. Although he initially kept his biological sex a secret from others at the party, fearing <a href="homophobia">homophobic</a> persecution, he revealed his identity to a girl with whom he had previously been to church. The girl informed her male friends, who accosted him outside the venue, demanding to know, "Are you a woman or a man?" One of the men used a lantern to examine Jones' feet, claiming that they were too large to be those of a biological woman. Discovering his sex, they started calling him "<a href="batty%20boy">batty boy</a>" and other homophobic epithets. Khloe tried to get him to avoid confrontation, whispering in his ear, "Walk with me, walk with me", but Jones refused, instead insisting to those assembled that he was female.

When someone pulled on Jones' bra strap, he ran away, and the crowd pursued and attacked him further down the road. He was beaten, stabbed, shot and run over by a car. He slipped in and out of consciousness for two hours before another attack finally killed him. There were no reports of anyone trying to help him during the altercation. Khloe was also attacked and almost raped, but escaped by hiding first in a church and then in neighbouring woods. Khloe commented, "When I saw Dwayne's body, I started shaking and crying. It was horrible." Police arrived at the scene at 5 am to find the body dumped in bushes along Orange Main Road. They launched an investigation into the homicide, inviting friends and family of the victim to contact them. Jones' family declined to claim the body, and his father refused to talk to the press about the incident.

On 14 August, Deputy Superintendent of Police Steve Brown announced that fourteen statements had been collected and that the investigation was progressing. In October 2013, a group of men set fire to the place in which Jones had lived as a squatter, forcing its four occupants to flee, in what was also believed to be an <a href="Violence%20against%20LGBT%20people">anti-LGBT hate crime</a>. Everald Morgan, an officer at the St James Public Health Department, requested that police provide protection for the four youths made homeless by the arson attack, but they declined to do so. Meanwhile, a charity named Dwayne's House was set up in Jones' memory to aid homeless LGBT youth in Jamaica. , however, no one had been arrested or charged, and in August 2015 the crime was still considered unsolved.

Jones' murder made headline news across Jamaica. Jamaica's Justice Minister, Senator <a href="Mark%20Golding">Mark Golding</a>, condemned the killing and called for an end to "depraved acts of violence" in Jamaica. He added that "all well-thinking Jamaicans" should embrace "the principle of respect for the basic human rights of all persons" and express tolerance towards minority groups such as the LGBT community. Annie Paul, the publications officer of the Jamaican campus of the <a href="University%20of%20the%20West%20Indies">University of the West Indies</a> (UWI), stated that on the basis of comments provided on social media, she thought that most Jamaicans believed that Jones provoked his own murder by cross-dressing within a society that did not tolerate such behaviour. Newton D. Duncan, the UWI Professor of Paediatric Surgery, similarly noted that the "overwhelming majority" of Jamaicans believed that cross-dressers are homosexuals and deserve punishment. He added that this was a common misconception, because the majority of cross-dressers were heterosexual. He condemned the attack and compared it to the <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynching</a> of an <a href="African%20Americans">African-American</a> man in <a href="Harper%20Lee">Harper Lee</a>'s novel "<a href="To%20Kill%20a%20Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>", drawing links between the anti-LGBT violence of Jamaica and the anti-black violence of the mid-20th century United States.

Writing in the Jamaican broadsheet "<a href="The%20Gleaner%20%28newspaper%29">The Gleaner</a>", Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, condemned the group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective use of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which <a href="The%20Bible%20and%20homosexuality">condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing</a>, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as <a href="adultery">adultery</a> and <a href="murder">murder</a>. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed it off with a humorous comment.

Jaevion Nelson, an <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> campaigner and human rights advocate, also published an article on the subject in "The Gleaner". He noted that his initial reaction was to question why Jones had gone to the dance party and why he was not satisfied in attending Jamaica's <a href="Underground%20culture">underground</a> gay parties. He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in "the culture of violence" by which a <a href="victim%20blaming">victim is blamed</a> for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on "rebuilding this great nation on the principles of inclusivity, love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever". Also in "The Gleaner", Sheila Veléz Martínez, a law professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a>, condemned the murder as "alarming evidence" of the high rates of homophobia in Jamaican society.

On 25 July, the <a href="J-FLAG">Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays</a> (J-FLAG), an LGBT rights organisation, issued a public statement expressing their "deep concern" regarding the case, and offering their condolences to Jones' friends and family. They encouraged local people to aid the police in locating the perpetrators of the attack, which they asserted was an affront to Jamaica's democracy. J-FLAG's director Dane Lewis later commented that despite an increase in homophobic violence, Jamaican society was becoming more tolerant toward LGBT people; he attributed this to the actions of individuals like Jones, who have helped improve the public visibility of LGBT people in Jamaican society. Another LGBT rights organisation, <a href="Quality%20of%20Citizenship%20Jamaica">Quality of Citizenship Jamaica</a>, issued a press release calling for the government and churches to engage with LGBT organisations to establish common ground which could be undergirded by the principle of "true respect for all," found in the nation's <a href="Jamaica%2C%20Land%20We%20Love">National Anthem</a>. Human rights organisation <a href="Jamaicans%20for%20Justice">Jamaicans for Justice</a> called on Prime Minister <a href="Portia%20Simpson-Miller">Portia Simpson-Miller</a> and religious leaders to condemn the murder, also commenting on what they saw as a lack of media coverage and public outrage about the incident, adding that "we must ask ourselves what this says about us as a people."

News of Jones' murder attracted international media attention, resulting in condemnation of the killing by human rights groups. Graeme Reid, the LGBT Rights Program director at Human Rights Watch in New York, issued a statement that the Jamaican government should send an "unequivocal message" that there would be "zero tolerance" of anti-LGBT violence. Reid noted that Jamaica's Prime Minister had vowed to decriminalise same-sex sexual activity in her <a href="Jamaican%20general%20election%2C%202011">2011 election campaign</a> but had yet to implement that promise. He encouraged the Jamaican authorities to take action to investigate Jones' murder and to promote respect for the country's LGBT citizens.

In a February 2014 briefing, the U.S. <a href="Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Democracy%2C%20Human%20Rights%2C%20and%20Labor">Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor</a>, <a href="Uzra%20Zeya">Uzra Zeya</a>, cited Jones' case as well as the torture and murder of Cameroonian HIV/AIDS activist <a href="Eric%20Ohena%20Lembembe">Eric Ohena Lembembe</a> as examples of the "troubling acts of violence" against LGBT individuals that had happened across the globe in the previous year.

In the United Kingdom, a black LGBT organisation, the <a href="Out%20and%20Proud%20Diamond%20Group">Out and Proud Diamond Group</a> (OPDG), in association with the <a href="Peter%20Tatchell">Peter Tatchell Foundation</a>, organised a protest outside Jamaica's London embassy on 28 August. Talking to press, the OPDG's Marvin Kibuuka condemned Jones' murder and called for supporters to actively oppose the persecution of LGBT people in both Jamaica and elsewhere. Peter Tatchell later asserted that the lack of action by Simpson-Miller and the police was tantamount to colluding with those guilty of an anti-LGBT hate crime.

In her introduction to an academic study of "queerness and children's literature", Laura Robinson, an Associate Professor of English at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%20of%20Canada">Royal Military College of Canada</a>, cited Jones' murder alongside the 2013 <a href="Russian%20LGBT%20propaganda%20law">Russian LGBT propaganda law</a> as an example in which youth issues intersected with LGBT issues. She added that Jones was a "child who did not end up having what <a href="Judith%20Butler">Judith Butler</a> calls a 'livable life'."

2014 U.S. Open Cup Final

The 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final was played on September 16, 2014, at PPL Park, now known as <a href="Talen%20Energy%20Stadium">Talen Energy Stadium</a>, in <a href="Chester%2C%20Pennsylvania">Chester, Pennsylvania</a>. The match determined the winner of the <a href="2014%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2014 U.S. Open Cup</a>, a tournament open to amateur and professional teams affiliated with the <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">United States Soccer Federation</a>. This was the 101st edition of <a href="Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">the oldest competition</a> in <a href="Soccer%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States soccer</a>. <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC">Seattle Sounders FC</a> won the match, defeating the <a href="Philadelphia%20Union">Philadelphia Union</a>. The crowd of 15,256 saw the teams go into <a href="Extra%20time%23Association%20football">extra time</a> level at 1–1 before the Sounders scored twice more to end the match 3–1.

Philadelphia and Seattle both play in the <a href="United%20States%20soccer%20league%20system">top tier</a> of American soccer, <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS), and <a href="bye%20%28sports%29">bypassed</a> the initial stages of the tournament with entries into the fourth round of play. The Sounders were in the midst of a <a href="Supporters%27%20Shield">Supporters' Shield</a>-winning regular season, while the Union's start was so poor that their coach was replaced a week prior to their first game in the competition. Philadelphia secured its berth in the final by defeating the <a href="Harrisburg%20City%20Islanders">Harrisburg City Islanders</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Cosmos%20%282010%29">New York Cosmos</a>, the <a href="New%20England%20Revolution">New England Revolution</a>, and <a href="FC%20Dallas">FC Dallas</a>. Seattle's road to the final included victories over <a href="PSA%20Elite">PSA Elite</a>, the <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a>, the <a href="Portland%20Timbers">Portland Timbers</a>, and the <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20Soccer%20Club">Chicago Fire</a>.

The coaches both chose strong squads in their attempts to win the trophy, though Sounders forward <a href="Kenny%20Cooper">Kenny Cooper</a>, later selected as Player of the Tournament, did not appear in the final. The Union's <a href="Maurice%20Edu">Maurice Edu</a> gave his team the lead with a goal in the first half, but the Sounders equalized with a second half strike by <a href="Chad%20Barrett">Chad Barrett</a>, and the match went into extra time. Although Philadelphia controlled periods of the match with chances throughout, <a href="Clint%20Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a> took the lead for Seattle in the first extra time period, and <a href="Obafemi%20Martins">Obafemi Martins</a> sealed a Seattle victory with a late goal. Seattle earned a $250,000 cash prize, as well as a berth into the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League</a>. Philadelphia received a $60,000 cash prize as the competition's runner-up.

The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all United States Soccer Federation affiliated teams, from <a href="United%20States%20Adult%20Soccer%20Association">amateur adult club teams</a> to the professional clubs of Major League Soccer (MLS). The 2014 competition was the 101st edition of the oldest soccer tournament in the United States. For the third consecutive season, all American-based MLS teams earned automatic qualification into the third round proper. Previously, only eight teams from MLS could qualify for the tournament: six automatically based on the previous year's league results, and two more via a play-in tournament.

Teams from <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and the surrounding region have had a successful history in the Open Cup: <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel%20F.C.%20%281907%E2%80%9330%29">Bethlehem Steel F.C.</a> won five trophies between 1915 and 1926, the <a href="Uhrik%20Truckers">Uhrik Truckers</a> won in 1936, and the <a href="Philadelphia%20Ukrainians">Philadelphia Ukrainians</a> won four times during the 1960s. The Union's <a href="third%20jersey%23Association%20football">alternative jersey</a>, worn throughout the competition, featured a large letter "B" in the lower left corner to honor Bethlehem. 

The Union began the MLS regular season with only 3 wins in 16 games. Their head coach <a href="John%20Hackworth">John Hackworth</a> was fired, and <a href="Jim%20Curtin">Jim Curtin</a> was named as his interim replacement, a week before the first Open Cup match against their lower-league affiliate <a href="Harrisburg%20City%20Islanders">Harrisburg City Islanders</a> on June 17. A successful run in the Open Cup had the potential to salvage the season, and Curtin said that the team was taking the home game "very seriously". Harrisburg plays in the <a href="USL%20Professional%20Division">USL Professional Division</a>—the third division of American soccer—but Philadelphia still played several of its regular starters, and did not permit Harrisburg to use two previously loaned Union players. Philadelphia was almost eliminated, but <a href="Maurice%20Edu">Maurice Edu</a> scored an equalizing goal in the 89th minute, and <a href="Andrew%20Wenger">Andrew Wenger</a> scored two more goals in extra time to advance the Union with a score of 3–1.

On June 24, Philadelphia played at home versus the <a href="New%20York%20Cosmos%20%282010%29">New York Cosmos</a> of the second-tier <a href="North%20American%20Soccer%20League">North American Soccer League</a> in what was only Curtin's second game as head coach. Overtime was again needed as the teams ended regulation tied at one apiece before <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Le%20Toux">Sébastien Le Toux</a> scored the game-winner in the 115th minute. Shortly after the goal, a melee erupted between the teams that resulted in two Cosmos players and one Union player being sent off for pushing and shoving. Two of New York's assistant coaches were also ejected for their parts in the disorder.

The team were at home against the <a href="New%20England%20Revolution">New England Revolution</a> of MLS for the fifth round, on July 8. They easily won with goals from <a href="Conor%20Casey">Conor Casey</a> and Le Toux. The latter's strike made him the modern-era Open Cup goals leader with a total of 14 scored in his career. Le Toux had a strong history with Seattle and the tournament before moving to the Union in 2009; he previously played for the second-division incarnation of the <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20%281994%E2%80%932008%29">Sounders</a> and won the <a href="2009%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2009 Open Cup</a> with the MLS side. He would later be named the runner-up to the year's Most Valuable Player of the Tournament. A dust storm accompanied by thunder and lightning halted the game for an hour after the 61st minute, but the Revolution could not recover from the two-goal deficit.

On August 12, Philadelphia traveled to MLS side <a href="FC%20Dallas">FC Dallas</a> for the semifinal. <a href="Amobi%20Okugo">Amobi Okugo</a> scored a goal in the first half before Dallas equalized. The match went to <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">kicks</a> as regulation and extra time resulted in a stalemate. Goalkeeper <a href="Zac%20MacMath">Zac MacMath</a> made diving saves of two Dallas attempts in the shoot-out to clinch the Union's place in the final—the closest the team had been to winning a trophy in its five-year history.

The Seattle Sounders won the Open Cup in 2009, <a href="2010%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">2010</a>, and <a href="2011%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">2011</a>. They also reached the final in <a href="2012%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">2012</a> but were eliminated by a lower-level side early in <a href="2013%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2013</a>. In 2014, they drew amateur club PSA Elite, a developmental lower-division team that had already been victorious in its first three rounds of the tournament. Seattle hosts most Open Cup home games at Tukwila's <a href="Starfire%20Sports">Starfire Sports</a> stadium. The ground holds about 4,000, which is much smaller than their normal home stadium, <a href="CenturyLink%20Field">CenturyLink Field</a>. Coach <a href="Sigi%20Schmid">Sigi Schmid</a> was quoted as saying "I think our guys thrive on the closeness of the crowd. It helps spur them on to good performances." Seattle was leading MLS entering the round on June 18, and easily won 5–0. <a href="Kenny%20Cooper">Kenny Cooper</a> scored twice in the victory.

The Sounders hosted the <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a> at Starfire on June 24 and both teams scored in the first half. The Earthquakes second-string goalie, <a href="David%20Bingham%20%28soccer%2C%20born%201989%29">David Bingham</a>, kept his team in the match by stopping three shots from <a href="Chad%20Barrett">Chad Barrett</a> late in the second half. Neither team scored in extra time and the game went to a shoot-out. After the shoot-out ended 4–1, goalkeeper <a href="Marcus%20Hahnemann">Marcus Hahnemann</a> celebrated by drinking a beer in front of the beer garden and the home fans.

On July 9, Seattle went against its <a href="Portland%20Timbers%E2%80%93Seattle%20Sounders%20rivalry">rival</a>, the <a href="Portland%20Timbers">Portland Timbers</a>, at Starfire for the quarterfinal. The Sounders went on top with an <a href="Osvaldo%20Alonso">Osvaldo Alonso</a> goal, but former Sounder <a href="Steve%20Zakuani">Steve Zakuani</a> assisted <a href="Darlington%20Nagbe">Darlington Nagbe</a> to score a last-second equalizer for the Timbers in the 93rd minute. Extra time saw the ejection of Portland's <a href="Diego%20Chara">Diego Chara</a> while Cooper and <a href="Marco%20Pappa">Marco Pappa</a> both found the back of the net to give the home team a 3–1 victory.

The team's semifinal match was at home against <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20SC">Chicago Fire</a> on August 13. The Fire were without 2013's MLS Most Valuable Player, <a href="Mike%20Magee%20%28soccer%29">Mike Magee</a>, due to suspension. Cooper and <a href="Andy%20Rose">Andy Rose</a> each scored twice while <a href="Obafemi%20Martins">Obafemi Martins</a> and Pappa both had a goal apiece. Seattle finished the game with three goals in the final four and a half minutes in the convincing 6–0 victory. The first goal of the match was Cooper's last of the competition as he did not play in the subsequent final. He ended the tournament with a total of 13 career Open Cup goals, one shy of Le Toux's modern-era total of 14. Cooper netted six in 2014 alone, and he would go on to be named 2014's Player of the Tournament.

The United States Soccer Federation determined the host of the final with a <a href="coin%20flipping">coin flip</a> on August 4, 2014. The winner of the toss was whoever was victorious in the FC Dallas/Philadelphia Union semifinal, meaning that the game would take place at <a href="Talen%20Energy%20Stadium">PPL Park</a> in <a href="Chester%2C%20Pennsylvania">Chester, Pennsylvania</a>. It was the eleventh time the greater-Philadelphia region hosted the final and the first since <a href="1994%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">1994</a>. The Union marketed the game by publicly displaying the trophy at local restaurants, landmarks, and events.

The Open Cup is not held in as high regard as the <a href="MLS%20Cup">MLS Cup</a>, but it is still an important achievement. For Philadelphia, it represented their first-ever chance at a trophy, whereas Seattle had been to the finals five times in the club's six-year history. With a victory, the Sounders would tie the Fire with four overall wins by an MLS team.

The all-time record between the clubs stood at 3–2 in favor of Seattle. The Sounders had beaten the Union earlier in the year during league play, but Philadelphia had improved since then. By the time of the final, the Union had a 10-game unbeaten streak at home. Seattle had recently lost three of five MLS matches but was still one of the best teams in the league. Seattle was the favorite, with one pundit comparing Philadelphia to perennial underdog <a href="Rocky%20Balboa">Rocky Balboa</a> of the film series "Rocky".

Player selection during the previous stages of the Open Cup was a challenge due to key personnel receiving call-ups for the <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a>. The Sounders had depth that could withstand losing players, and did not rest starters in the lead-up to the final game. The Union rested several starters during the previous weekend's league match. Philadelphia's Casey, Le Toux, and <a href="Cristian%20Maidana">Cristian Maidana</a> were significant attacking threats, while Seattle had the striking pair of Martins and <a href="Clint%20Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a>. Defensively, Edu was Philadelphia's strongest player. Seattle also had a strong defense with young national team prospect <a href="DeAndre%20Yedlin">DeAndre Yedlin</a>, and eventual MLS Defender of the Year <a href="Chad%20Marshall">Chad Marshall</a>.

<a href="Kick-off%20%28association%20football%29">Kickoff</a> was scheduled for 7:30 pm local time. Armando Villarreal was the <a href="referee%20%28association%20football%29">referee</a> and his <a href="assistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29">assistants</a> were Peter Manikowski and Corey Parker. The <a href="Assistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29%23Fourth%20official">fourth official</a> was Jose Carlos Rivero. There were no suspensions or injuries of note. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of .

Sounders coach Schmid made adjustments to his usual starting lineup. Pappa did not start due to a recent return from international duty with <a href="Guatemala%20national%20football%20team">Guatemala</a>, while star striker Martins was on the bench as well. Although he won the Golden Boot for most goals scored, Cooper was primarily a bench player throughout the year and did not start the match. Although lacking those playmakers, the Sounders came out attacking, and their first big chance came in the 10th minute when Rose slung a low cross near the face of the goal to Dempsey, whose resulting shot was off-frame.

The Union increased its pace with Andrew Wenger playing wide on the left where he repeatedly got past Yedlin to get to the byline or cut back to shoot. Maidana and Le Toux strengthened Philadelphia's position by combining on the other side of the field to penetrate Seattle's defense. Wenger connected with Le Toux who took a shot, but Seattle goalkeeper <a href="Stefan%20Frei">Stefan Frei</a> was quick enough to make the stop. In the 38th minute, Maidana was fouled by <a href="Leonardo%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Leonardo González</a> wide right of the penalty area. Maidana's resulting free kick curled towards the back post where <a href="Brad%20Evans">Brad Evans</a> lost his footing and Edu glanced the ball with his forehead to put it in the back of the net. The home team kept control of the first half and continued creating scoring opportunities.

Neither team made substitutions at halftime. The Sounders came out on the attack and were awarded a corner kick just three minutes into the period. <a href="Carlos%20Vald%C3%A9s%20%28footballer%29">Carlos Valdes</a> attempted to clear the ball but Marshall headed it towards goal for MacMath to clear. Barrett scored from close range and the match was level at 1–1.

Seattle maintained momentum with Yedlin beginning to overcome Wenger while Martins replaced Barrett in the 60th minute. Philadelphia's midfield then again began to assert dominance and Maidana had a breakaway in the 72nd minute. Yedlin sprinted to make up ground to stop the attack in what MLS would call the "defensive play of the game". Dempsey had a chance to score off a cross from Pappa in the 76th minute but could not get a foot on the ball. Martins then had another chance that went wide before control shifted yet again to Philadelphia.

Seattle replaced <a href="Lamar%20Neagle">Lamar Neagle</a> with Pappa in the 74th minute in an attempt to create an advantage. Philadelphia answered with two more chances that almost won the match. Casey received a <a href="Penalty%20card%23Yellow%20card">yellow card</a> at the 57th minute and was later replaced by <a href="Pedro%20Ribeiro%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Pedro Ribeiro</a>. In the 88th minute, <a href="Raymon%20Gaddis">Raymon Gaddis</a> won the ball and took a shot that was deflected. Ribeiro took a shot but it lacked power. In stoppage time, <a href="Vincent%20Nogueira">Vincent Nogueira</a> had another close shot that struck the post and ricocheted dangerously close to the goal before being cleared.

Martins opened extra time with a shot on goal while the Sounders played increasingly higher on the field. Seattle took the lead in the 101st minute when Dempsey and Martins connected on a play that resulted in Dempsey making a low shot. Martins, Dempsey, and Pappa effectively countered Philadelphia's attacks in the second half of extra time and Pappa hit the crossbar on an attempted shot. Valdes had an excellent opportunity to tie the match in the 111th minute when he made a header towards the Sounders goal, but the shot was weak and easily saved. Although Philadelphia was pressing the attack, Martins scored in the 114th minute to put the Sounders up 3–1.

Both teams had chances during the match with Philadelphia making an especially intense push in the final 15 minutes. While both defenses struggled throughout, Frei and MacMath combined for a total of seven saves (four and three, respectively). Schmid told the press after the final: "From a fans' standpoint, it was probably a very, very entertaining game." A writer for "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" quipped that "Schmid's decision not to start Obafemi Martins and Pappa was confusing — and then looked like a stroke of genius", as both were integral to the Sounders offense in the later stages of the game. Schmid told reporters during a post-match interview that Martins did not start due to a <a href="strain%20%28injury%29">muscle strain</a>. The coach also praised the ability of Martins and Dempsey to complete key passes with each other. The Sounders received a $250,000 cash prize for winning the tournament. It was Dempsey's first club trophy of his long career, and he beat Martins in voting to be named the Player of the Round. Yedlin and Frei also received votes. Seattle went on to win the MLS Supporters' Shield for having the best record in the league before being eliminated from the playoffs. The Open Cup win granted the team a spot in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League</a>.

As runner-up, Philadelphia was awarded $60,000. Curtin told the media after the game: "I've never been proud of anything in my life that ended in a loss before ... This is the first time." Curtin's leadership on the road to the final helped convince the players, fans, media, and front office of his ability to manage the club. Although the team missed the league playoffs, his performance was enough for the team to remove the "interim" tag from his title as head coach.

<a href="GOL%20TV">GOL TV</a> had broadcasting rights for the tournament between 2012 and 2014. The channel is not shown on many television packages, but Comcast picked up the feed in the Philadelphia area. Attendance at PPL Park was 15,256, the lowest for an Open Cup final in six years. A <a href="streaming%20media">live stream</a> was made available over the Internet for a fee, but the quality was so poor that refunds were promised after only 20 minutes. After the game, a writer for "The Seattle Times" panned the broadcast arrangements and low attendance at PPL Park, saying, "It's a shame so few were able to see it."

John Sherman

John Sherman (May 10, 1823October 22, 1900) was a politician from the U.S. state of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and into the late nineteenth century. A member of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, he served in both houses of the <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a>. He also served as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. Sherman sought the Republican presidential nomination three times, coming closest in <a href="1888%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1888</a>, but was never chosen by the party. His brothers included <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>; <a href="Charles%20Taylor%20Sherman">Charles Taylor Sherman</a>, a federal judge in Ohio; and <a href="Hoyt%20Sherman">Hoyt Sherman</a>, an Iowa banker.

Born in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Ohio">Lancaster, Ohio</a>, Sherman later moved to <a href="Mansfield%2C%20Ohio">Mansfield</a>, where he began a law career before entering politics. Initially a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a>, Sherman was among those <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-slavery</a> activists who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of Representatives. As a member of the House, Sherman traveled to <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> to investigate <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">the unrest</a> between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was nearly elected <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker</a> in <a href="36th%20United%20States%20Congress">1859</a>. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201860%20and%201861%23Elections%20during%20the%2037th%20Congress">1861</a>. As a senator, he was a leader in financial matters, helping to redesign the United States' <a href="monetary%20system">monetary system</a> to meet the needs of a nation torn apart by civil war. After the war, he worked to produce legislation that would restore the nation's credit abroad and produce a stable, <a href="Gold%20standard%23Fluctuations%20in%20the%20US%20gold%20stock%2C%201862%E2%80%931877">gold-backed currency</a> at home.

Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the administration of <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime <a href="inflation">inflation</a>ary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">immigration</a>, <a href="Competition%20law">business competition law</a>, and the regulation of <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Act%20of%201887">interstate commerce</a>. Sherman was the principal author of the <a href="Sherman%20Antitrust%20Act">Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890</a>, which was signed into law by President <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>. In 1897, President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 at the start of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>. Sherman died at his home in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in 1900.

Sherman was born in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Ohio">Lancaster, Ohio</a> to <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Sherman">Charles Robert Sherman</a> and his wife, Mary Hoyt Sherman, the eighth of their 11 children. John Sherman's grandfather, <a href="Taylor%20Sherman">Taylor Sherman</a>, a Connecticut lawyer and judge, first visited Ohio in the early nineteenth century, gaining title to several parcels of land before returning to Connecticut. After Taylor's death in 1815, his son Charles, newly married to Mary Hoyt, moved the family west to Ohio. Several other Sherman relatives soon followed, and Charles became established as a lawyer in Lancaster. By the time of John Sherman's birth, Charles had just been appointed a justice of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Ohio">Supreme Court of Ohio</a>.

Sherman's father died suddenly in 1829, leaving his mother to care for 11 children. Several of the oldest children, including Sherman's older brother <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William</a>, were fostered with nearby relatives, but John and his brother <a href="Hoyt%20Sherman">Hoyt</a> stayed with their mother in Lancaster until 1831. In that year, Sherman's father's cousin (also named John Sherman) took Sherman into his home in <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20Ohio">Mount Vernon, Ohio</a>, where he enrolled in school. The other John Sherman intended for his namesake to study there until he was ready to enroll at nearby <a href="Kenyon%20College">Kenyon College</a>, but Sherman disliked school and was, in his own words, "a troublesome boy". In 1835, he returned to <a href="John%20Sherman%20Birthplace">his mother's home</a> in Lancaster. Sherman continued his education there at a local academy where, after being briefly expelled for punching a teacher, he studied for two years.

In 1837, Sherman left school and found a job as a junior <a href="construction%20surveying">surveyor</a> on construction of improvements to the <a href="Muskingum%20River">Muskingum River</a>. Because he had obtained the job through <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> <a href="spoils%20system">patronage</a>, the election of a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> governor in 1838 meant that Sherman and the rest of his surveying crew were discharged from their jobs in June 1839. The following year, he moved to <a href="Mansfield%2C%20Ohio">Mansfield</a> to <a href="reading%20law">study law</a> in the office of his older brother, <a href="Charles%20Taylor%20Sherman">Charles Taylor Sherman</a>. He was admitted to the <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in 1844 and joined his brother's firm. Sherman quickly became successful at the practice of law, and by 1847 had accumulated property worth $10,000 and was a partner in several local businesses. By that time, Sherman and his brother Charles were able to support their mother and two unmarried sisters, who now moved to a house Sherman purchased in Mansfield. In 1848, Sherman married Margaret Cecelia Stewart, the daughter of a local judge. The couple never had any biological children, but adopted a daughter, Mary, in 1864.

Around the same time, Sherman began to take a larger role in politics. In 1844, he addressed a political rally on behalf of the Whig candidate for president that year, <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>. Four years later, Sherman was a delegate to the <a href="1848%20Whig%20National%20Convention">Whig National Convention</a> where the eventual winner <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> was nominated. As with most conservative Whigs, Sherman supported the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a> as the best solution to the growing sectional divide. In 1852, Sherman was again a delegate to the <a href="1852%20Whig%20National%20Convention">Whig National Convention</a>, where he supported the eventual nominee, <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>, against rivals <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a> and incumbent <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>, who had become president following Taylor's death.

Sherman moved north to <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> in 1853 and established a law office there with two partners. Events soon interrupted Sherman's plans for a new law firm, as the passage of the <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a> in 1854 inspired him (and many other anti-slavery Northerners) to take a more involved role in politics. That Act, the brainchild of Illinois Democrat <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a>, opened the two named <a href="Territories%20of%20the%20United%20States">territories</a> to slavery, an implicit repeal of the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> of 1820. Intended to quiet national agitation over slavery by shifting the decision to local settlers, Douglas's Act instead inflamed anti-slavery sentiment in the North by allowing the possibility of slavery's expansion to territories held as free soil for three decades. Two months after the Act's passage, Sherman became a candidate for <a href="Ohio%27s%2013th%20congressional%20district">Ohio's 13th congressional district</a>. A local convention nominated Sherman over two other candidates to represent what was then called the <a href="Opposition%20Party%20%28Northern%20U.S.%29">Opposition Party</a> (later to become the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>). The new party, a fusion of <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soilers</a>, Whigs, and anti-slavery Democrats, had many discordant elements, and some among the former group thought Sherman too conservative on the slavery question. Nevertheless, they supported him against the incumbent Democrat, <a href="William%20D.%20Lindsley">William D. Lindsley</a>. Democrats were defeated across Ohio that year, and Sherman was elected by 2,823 votes.

When the <a href="34th%20United%20States%20Congress">34th United States Congress</a> convened in December 1855, members opposed to Democratic President <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> (most of them Northerners) held the majority in the House, while the Democrats retained their majority in the Senate. That House majority, however, was not fully unified, with some members adhering to the new anti-Nebraska party, and others loyal to the new nativist <a href="Know%20Nothing">American</a> (or "Know-Nothing") party. The Know Nothings were also fractious, with some former Whigs and some former Free Soilers in their ranks. The result was a House that was unable to elect a Speaker for two months. When they finally agreed on the election of <a href="Nathaniel%20Banks">Nathaniel Banks</a> of Massachusetts, the House quickly turned to the matter of Kansas. Preventing <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">the expansion of slavery to Kansas</a> was the one issue that united Banks's fragile majority, and the House resolved to send three members to investigate the situation in that territory; Sherman was one of the three selected.

Sherman spent two months in the territory and was the primary author of the 1,188-page report filed on conditions there when they returned in April 1856. The report explained what anti-administration members already feared: that the principle of local control was being seriously undermined by the <a href="Border%20Ruffian">invasion of Missourians</a> who, while not intending to settle there, used violence to coerce the Kansans to elect pro-slavery members to the territorial legislature. The House took no action on the reports, but they were widely distributed as campaign documents. That July, Sherman proposed an amendment to an army appropriation act to bar use of federal troops to enforce the acts of the Kansas territorial legislature, which many now viewed as an illegitimate body. The amendment narrowly passed the House, but was removed by the Senate; the House ultimately agreed to the change. In spite of this defeat, however, Sherman had achieved considerable prominence for a freshman representative.

Sherman was reelected in 1856, defeating his Democratic opponent, <a href="Herman%20J.%20Brumback">Herman J. Brumback</a>, by 2,861 votes. The Republican candidate for president, <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a>, carried Ohio while <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">losing the national vote</a> to the Democrat, <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>. When the <a href="35th%20United%20States%20Congress">35th Congress</a> assembled in December 1857, the anti-Nebraska coalition—now formally the Republicans—had lost control of the House, and Sherman found himself in the minority. The sectional crisis had also deepened in the past year. In March 1857, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> issued its decision in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>", holding that Congress had no power to prevent slavery in the territories and that blacks—whether free or enslaved—could not be citizens of the United States. In December of that year, in an election boycotted by free-state partisans, Kansas adopted the pro-slavery <a href="Lecompton%20Constitution">Lecompton Constitution</a> and petitioned Congress to be admitted as a slave state. Buchanan urged that Congress take up the matter, and the Senate approved a bill to admit Kansas. Sherman spoke against the Kansas bill in the House, pointing out the evidence of fraud in the elections there. Some of the Northern Democrats joined with a unanimous Republican caucus to defeat the measure. Congress agreed to a compromise measure, by which Kansas would be admitted after another referendum on the Lecompton Constitution. The electorate rejected slavery and remained a territory, a decision Sherman would later call "the turning point of the slavery controversy".

Sherman's second term also saw his first speeches in Congress on the country's financial situation, which had been harmed by the <a href="Panic%20of%201857">Panic of 1857</a>. Citing the need to pare unnecessary expenditures in light of diminished revenue, Sherman especially criticized Southern senators for adding appropriations to the House's bills. His speech attracted attention and was the start of Sherman's focus on financial matters, which would continue throughout his long political career.

The voters returned Sherman to office for a third term in 1858. After a brief special session in March 1859, the <a href="36th%20United%20States%20Congress">36th Congress</a> adjourned, and Sherman and his wife went on vacation to Europe. When they returned that December, the situation was similar to that of four years earlier: no party had an absolute majority. Republicans held 109 seats, Democrats 101, and the combination of <a href="Opposition%20Party%20%28Southern%20U.S.%29">Oppositionists</a> and <a href="Know%20Nothing">Know Nothing</a>s 27. Again, sectional tension had increased while Congress was in recess, this time due to <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a>'s <a href="John%20Brown%27s%20raid%20on%20Harpers%20Ferry">raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia</a>. The election for Speaker of the House promised to be contentious. This time, Sherman was among the leading candidates, receiving the second-largest number of votes on the first ballot, with no candidate receiving a majority. The election for Speaker was sidetracked immediately by a furor over an anti-slavery book, "<a href="The%20Impending%20Crisis%20of%20the%20South">The Impending Crisis of the South</a>", written by <a href="Hinton%20Rowan%20Helper">Hinton Rowan Helper</a> and endorsed by many Republican members. Southerners accused Sherman of having endorsed the book, while he protested that he only endorsed its use as a campaign tool and had never read it. After two months of balloting, no decision had been reached. After their attempts to adopt a plurality rule failed, Sherman accepted that he could not be elected, and withdrew. Republicans then shifted their support to <a href="William%20Pennington">William Pennington</a>, who was elected on the forty-fourth ballot.

Pennington assigned Sherman to serve as chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">Committee on Ways and Means</a>, where he spent much of his time on appropriations bills, while cooperating with his colleague <a href="Justin%20Smith%20Morrill">Justin Smith Morrill</a> on the passage of what became known as the <a href="Morrill%20Tariff">Morrill Tariff</a>. The Morrill Tariff raised <a href="duty%20%28economics%29">duties</a> on imports to close the deficit that had resulted from falling revenues. It also had the effect of encouraging domestic industries, which appealed to the former Whigs in the Republican party. Sherman spoke in favor of the bill, and it passed the House by a vote of 105 to 64. The tariff bill would likely have died in the Senate, but the withdrawal of Southern members at the start of the Civil War allowed the <a href="rump%20legislature">rump</a> Senate to pass the bill in the 36th Congress final session, and President Buchanan signed it into law in February 1861. Likewise, Sherman supported a bill admitting Kansas as a free state that passed in 1861.

Sherman was renominated for Congress in 1860 and was active in <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s campaign for President, giving speeches on his behalf in several states. Both were elected, with Sherman defeating his opponent, <a href="Barnabas%20Burns">Barnabas Burns</a>, by 2,864 votes. He returned to Washington for the <a href="lame%20duck%20session">lame duck session</a> of the 36th Congress. By February 1861, seven states had reacted to Lincoln's election by <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">seceding</a> from the Union. In response, Congress passed a constitutional amendment proposed by Representative <a href="Thomas%20Corwin">Thomas Corwin</a> of Ohio. Known today as the <a href="Corwin%20Amendment">Corwin Amendment</a>, it was an attempt to forge a compromise to keep the remaining slave states in the Union and entice the seceded states to return. Corwin's legislation would have preserved the "status quo" on slavery and prohibited any future amendment granting Congress power to interfere with slavery in the states. Sherman voted for the amendment, which passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification. Few states ratified it, and the passage of the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a> in 1865, outlawing slavery, rendered the compromise measure moot.

Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to nominate Senator <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> of Ohio to be <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and after two weeks of indecisive balloting, the <a href="Ohio%20General%20Assembly">Ohio Legislature</a> elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as the Senate had been called into <a href="special%20session">special session</a> to deal with the secession crisis. The Senate that convened at the start of the <a href="37th%20United%20States%20Congress">37th Congress</a> had a Republican majority for the first time, a majority that grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to the White House to meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months to put down the rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid <a href="colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> of Ohio Volunteers.

The <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> expenditures quickly strained the government's already fragile financial situation and Sherman, assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Finance">Senate Finance Committee</a>, was involved in the process of increasing the revenue. In July 1861, Congress authorized the government to issue <a href="Demand%20Note">Demand Note</a>s, the first form of paper money issued directly by the United States government. The notes were redeemable in specie ("i.e.", gold or silver coin) but, as Sherman would note in his memoirs, they did not solve the revenue problem, as the government did not have the coin to redeem the notes should they all be presented for payment. To solve this problem, Chase asked for and Congress authorized the issuance of $150 million in <a href="United%20States%20Treasury%20security">bonds</a>, which (as banks purchased them with gold) replenished the treasury. Congress also sought to increase revenue when they passed the <a href="Revenue%20Act%20of%201861">Revenue Act of 1861</a>, which imposed the first federal <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> in American history. Sherman endorsed the measure, and even spoke in favor of a steeper tax than the one imposed by the Act (3% on income above $800), preferring to raise revenue by taxation than by borrowing. In August, the special session closed and Sherman returned home to Mansfield to promote military recruitment again.

When Congress returned to Washington in December 1861, Sherman and the Finance Committee continued their attempts to fix the deepening financial crisis caused by the war. The financial situation had continued to worsen, resulting that month in banks suspending specie payments—that is, they refused to redeem their <a href="banknote">banknote</a>s for gold. Gold began to disappear from circulation. With the 500,000 soldiers in the field, the government was spending the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million per day. Sherman understood that "a radical change in existing laws relating to our currency must be made, or ... the destruction of the Union would be unavoidable ..." Secretary Chase agreed and proposed that the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Department</a> issue <a href="United%20States%20Note">United States Note</a>s that were redeemable not in specie but in 6% government bonds. The bills would be "lawful money and a legal tender in the payment of all debts". Nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in the United States, but Congress yielded to the wartime necessities, and the resulting <a href="First%20Legal%20Tender%20Act">First Legal Tender Act</a> passed both the House and the Senate. The Act limited the notes (later known as "greenbacks") to $150 million, but two subsequent Legal Tender Acts that year expanded the limit to $450 million. The idea of making paper money legal tender was controversial, and <a href="William%20Pitt%20Fessenden">William Pitt Fessenden</a> of Maine, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was among many who opposed the proposal. Sherman disagreed and spoke in favor of the idea. He defended his position as necessary in his memoirs, saying "from the passage of the legal tender act, by which means were provided for utilizing the wealth of the country in the suppression of the rebellion, the tide of war turned in our favor".

Reform of the nation's financial system continued in 1863 with the passage of the <a href="National%20Bank%20Act">National Banking Act of 1863</a>. This Act, first proposed by Chase in 1861 and introduced by Sherman two years later, established a series of nationally chartered private banks that would issue <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Note">banknotes</a> in coordination with the Treasury, replacing (though not completely) the then in existence. Although the immediate purpose was to fund the war, the National Bank Act was intended to be permanent, and remained the law until 1913. A 10% tax on state banknotes passed in 1865 to encourage the shift to a national bank system. Sherman agreed with Chase wholeheartedly and hoped that state banking would be eliminated. Sherman believed the state-by-state system of regulation was disorderly and unable to facilitate the level of borrowing a modern nation might require. He also believed the state banks were unconstitutional. Not all Republicans shared Sherman's views, and when the Act eventually passed the Senate, it was by a narrow 23–21 vote. Lincoln signed the bill into law on February 25, 1863.

Besides his role in financial matters, Sherman also participated in debate over the conduct of the war and goals for the post-war nation. Sherman voted for the <a href="Confiscation%20Act%20of%201861">Confiscation Act of 1861</a>, which allowed the government to confiscate any property being used to support the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> war effort (including slaves) and for the act <a href="District%20of%20Columbia%20Compensated%20Emancipation%20Act">abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia</a>. He also voted for the <a href="Confiscation%20Act%20of%201862">Confiscation Act of 1862</a>, which clarified that slaves "<a href="Contraband%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">confiscated</a>" under the 1861 Act were freed. In 1864, Sherman voted for the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>, abolishing slavery. After some effort, it passed Congress and was ratified by the states the next year.

When the session ended, Sherman campaigned in Indiana and Ohio for <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">Lincoln's reelection</a>. In 1865, he attended <a href="Second%20inauguration%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln's second inauguration</a>, then traveled to Savannah, Georgia to meet with his brother William, who had arrived there after his army's <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">march to the sea</a>. Sherman returned home to Mansfield in April, where he learned of <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln's assassination</a> just days after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">Confederate surrender</a>. He was again in Washington for the <a href="Grand%20Review%20of%20the%20Armies">Grand Review of the Armies</a> and then returned home until December, when the <a href="39th%20United%20States%20Congress">39th Congress</a> assembled. There had been no special session that summer, and President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, Lincoln's successor, had taken the lead on <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> of the conquered South, to the consternation of many in Congress. Sherman and Johnson had been friendly, and some observers hoped that Sherman could serve as a liaison between Johnson and the party's "Radical" wing. By February 1866, however, Johnson was publicly attacking these <a href="Radical%20Republican">Radical Republican</a>s, who demanded harsh punishment of the rebels and federal action to assist the freedmen. The following month Johnson vetoed the proposed <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201866">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>, which had passed Congress with overwhelming numbers. Sherman joined in re-passing the bill over Johnson's veto. That same year, Sherman voted for the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, which guaranteed equal protection of the laws to the freedmen. It became law in 1868.

By then, Johnson had made himself the enemy of most Republicans in Congress, including Sherman. Sherman, a moderate, took the side of the Radicals in voting for the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281867%29">Tenure of Office Act</a>, which passed over Johnson's veto in 1867— but in debating the <a href="Reconstruction%20Acts">First Reconstruction Act</a>, he argued against disenfranchising Southern men who had participated in the rebellion. The latter bill, amended to remove that provision, also passed over Johnson's veto. The continued conflict between Johnson and Congress culminated in <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">Johnson's impeachment</a> by the House in 1868. After a trial in the Senate, Sherman voted to convict, but the total vote was one short of the required two-thirds majority, and Johnson continued in office. Writing later, Sherman said that although he "liked the President personally and harbored against him none of the prejudice and animosity of some others," he believed Johnson had violated the Tenure of Office Act and accordingly voted to remove him from office.

With <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> elected to the Presidency <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201868">in 1868</a>, Congress had a more willing partner in Reconstruction. The <a href="40th%20United%20States%20Congress">40th Congress</a>'s lame duck session passed the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, which guaranteed that the right to vote could not be restricted because of race; Sherman joined the two-thirds majority that voted for its passage. The <a href="41st%20United%20States%20Congress">41st Congress</a> passed the <a href="Enforcement%20Act%20of%201870">Enforcement Act of 1870</a> to enforce its civil rights Amendments among a hostile Southern population. That Act, written by <a href="John%20Bingham">John Bingham</a> of Ohio to mirror the Fourteenth Amendment, created penalties for violating another person's constitutional rights. The next year, Congress passed the <a href="Enforcement%20Act%20of%201871%20%28third%20act%29">Ku Klux Klan Act</a>, which strengthened the Enforcement Act by allowing federal trials and federal troops to be used. Sherman voted in favor of both Acts, which had Grant's support.

With the financial crisis abated, many in Congress wanted the greenbacks to be withdrawn from circulation. The public had never seen greenbacks as equivalent to specie, and by 1866 they circulated at a considerable discount, although their value had risen since the end of the war. <a href="Hugh%20McCulloch">Hugh McCulloch</a>, the Treasury Secretary under Lincoln and Johnson, believed the notes were an emergency measure only and thought they should be gradually withdrawn. McCulloch proposed a bill, the <a href="Contraction%20Act">Contraction Act</a>, to convert some of the greenbacks from notes redeemable in bonds to interest-bearing notes redeemable in coin. Most Senate Finance Committee members had no objection, and Sherman found himself alone in opposition to it, believing that withdrawing greenbacks from circulation would contract the money supply and harm the economy. Sherman instead favored leaving the existing notes in circulation and letting the growth in population catch up to the growth in money supply. He suggested an amendment that would instead just allow the Treasury to redeem the notes for lower-interest bonds, now that the government's borrowing costs had decreased. Sherman's amendment was voted down, and the Contraction Act passed; greenbacks would be gradually withdrawn, but those still circulating would be redeemable for the high-interest bonds as before. In his memoirs, Sherman called this law "the most injurious and expensive financial measure ever enacted by Congress," as the continued high-interest payments it required "added fully $300,000,000 of interest" to the <a href="National%20debt%20of%20the%20United%20States">national debt</a>.

The Ohio legislature reelected Sherman to another six-year term that year, and when (after a three-month vacation in Europe) he resumed his seat he again turned to the greenback question. Public support for greenbacks had grown, especially among businesspeople who thought withdrawal would lead to lower prices. When a bill passed the House suspending the authority to retire greenbacks under the Contraction Act, Sherman supported it in the Senate. It passed the Senate 33–4, and became law in 1868.

In <a href="41st%20United%20States%20Congress">the next Congress</a>, among the first bills to pass the house was the <a href="Public%20Credit%20Act%20of%201869">Public Credit Act of 1869</a>, which would require the government to pay bondholders in gold, not greenbacks. The 1868 election campaign had seen the Democrats proposing to repay the bondholders (mostly supporters of the Union war effort) in paper; Republicans favored gold, as the bonds had been purchased with gold. Sherman agreed with his fellow Republicans and voted with them to pass the bill 42-13. Sherman continued to favor wider circulation of the greenback when he voted for the <a href="Currency%20Act%20of%201870">Currency Act of 1870</a>, which authorized an additional $54 million in United States Notes. Sherman was also involved in debate over the <a href="Funding%20Act%20of%201870">Funding Act of 1870</a>. The Funding Act, which Sherman called "[t]he most important financial measure of that Congress," refunded the national debt. The bill as Sherman wrote it authorized $1.2 billion of low-interest rate bonds to be used to purchase the high-rate bonds issued during the war, to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs brought about by the peace and security that followed the Union victory. The Act was the subject of considerable debate over the exact rates and amounts, but once the differences were ironed out, it passed by large majorities in both houses. While Sherman was unhappy with the compromises (especially the extension of the bonds' term to 30 years, which he believed too long), he saw the bill as an improvement over the existing conditions and urged its passage.

The Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to a third term in 1872 after then-governor <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> declined the invitation of several legislators to run against Sherman. Sherman returned to his leadership of the Finance Committee, and the issues of greenbacks, gold, and silver continued into the next several congresses. Since the early days of the republic, the United States had minted both gold and silver coins, and for decades the ratio of value between them had been set by law at 16:1. Both metals were subject to "free coinage"; that is, anyone could bring any amount of silver or gold to the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> and have it converted to coinage. The ratio was bound to be imperfect, as the amount of gold and silver mined and the demand for it around the world fluctuated from year to year; as a metal's market price exceeded its legal price, coins of that metal would disappear from circulation (a phenomenon known as <a href="Gresham%27s%20law">Gresham's law</a>). Before the Civil War, gold circulated freely and silver disappeared, and while silver dollars were legal tender, Sherman wrote that "[a]lthough I was quite active in business ... I do not remember at that time to have ever seen a silver dollar". The issuance of greenbacks had pushed debate over gold-silver ratios to the background as coins of both metals disappeared from the nation's commerce in favor of the new paper notes, but as the dollar became stronger in peacetime and the national debt payments were guaranteed to be paid in specie, Congress saw the need to update the coinage laws.

Grant's Treasury Secretary, <a href="George%20S.%20Boutwell">George S. Boutwell</a>, sent Sherman (who was by now Senate Finance Committee Chairman) a draft of what would become the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>. The list of legal coins duplicated that of the previous coinage act, leaving off only the silver dollar and two smaller coins. The rationale given in the Treasury report accompanying the draft bill was that to mint a gold dollar and a silver dollar with different intrinsic values was problematic; as the silver dollar did not circulate and the gold did, it made sense to drop the unused coin. Opponents of the bill would later call this omission the "Crime of '73," and would mean it quite literally, circulating tales of widespread bribery of Congressmen by foreign agents. Sherman emphasized in his memoirs that the bill was openly debated for several years and passed both Houses with overwhelming support and that, given the continued circulation of smaller silver coins at the same 16:1 ratio, nothing had been "demonetized," as his opponents claimed. Silver was still legal tender, but only for sums up to five dollars. On the other hand, later scholars have suggested that Sherman and others wished to demonetize silver for years and move the country onto a <a href="gold%20standard">gold-only standard</a> of currency—not for some corrupt gain, but because they believed it was the path to a strong, secure currency.

In switching to what was essentially a gold standard, the United States joined a host of nations around the world that based their currencies on gold alone. But in doing so, these nations exacerbated the demand for gold as opposed to silver which, combined with more silver being mined, drove the cost of gold up and silver down. The result was not apparent immediately after the Coinage Act's passage, but by 1879 the ratio between the price of gold and that of silver had risen from 16.4:1 to 18.4:1; by 1896 it was 30:1. The ultimate effect was more expensive gold, which meant lower prices and deflation for other goods. The deflation made the effects of the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a> worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values, and the divide between pro- and anti-silver forces grew in the decades to come. Writing in 1895, Sherman defended the bill, saying that, barring some international agreement to switch the entire world to a <a href="bimetallism">bimetallic standard</a>, the United States dollar should remain a gold-backed currency.

At the same time as he sought to reform the coinage, Sherman worked for "resumption"—the policy of resuming specie payment on all bank notes, including the greenbacks. The idea of withdrawing the greenbacks from circulation altogether had been tried and quickly rejected in 1866; the notes were, as Sherman said, "a great favorite of the people". The economic turmoil of the Panic of 1873 made it even more clear that shrinking the money supply would be harmful to the average American. Still, Sherman (and others) desired an eventual return to a single circulating medium: gold. As he said in an 1874 speech, "a specie standard is the best and the only true standard of all values, recognized as such by all civilized nations of our generation". If greenbacks were not to be withdrawn from circulation, therefore, they must be made equal to the gold dollar.

While Sherman stood against printing additional greenbacks, as late as 1872 he remained a proponent of keeping existing greenbacks backed by bonds in circulation. Over the next two years, Sherman worked to develop what became the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">Specie Payment Resumption Act</a>. The Act was a compromise. It required gradual reduction of the maximum value of greenbacks allowed to circulate to $300 million and, while earlier drafts had allowed the Treasury the choice between paying in bonds or coin, the final version of the Act required payment in specie, starting in 1879. The bill passed on a party-line vote in the lame duck session of the <a href="43rd%20United%20States%20Congress">43rd Congress</a>, and President Grant signed it into law on January 14, 1875.

After the close of the session, Sherman returned to Ohio to campaign for the Republican nominee for governor there, former governor Rutherford B. Hayes. The issue of specie payments was debated in the campaign, with Hayes endorsing Sherman's position and his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor <a href="William%20Allen%20%28governor%29">William Allen</a>, in favor of increased circulation of greenbacks redeemable in bonds. Hayes won a narrow victory and was soon mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 1876. The controversy over resumption carried into the presidential election. The Democratic platform that year demanded repeal of the Resumption Act, while the Republicans nominated Hayes, whose position in favor of a gold standard was well known. The <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">election of 1876</a> was very close, and the electoral votes of several states were <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">ardently disputed</a> until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Louisiana was one of the states in which both parties claimed victory, and Grant asked Sherman and a few other men to go to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> and ensure the party's interests were represented.

Sherman, by this time thoroughly displeased with Grant and his administration, nonetheless took up the call in the name of party loyalty, joining <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a>, <a href="Stanley%20Matthews%20%28lawyer%29">Stanley Matthews</a>, and other Republican politicians in Louisiana a few days later. The Democrats likewise sent their politicos, and the two sides met to observe the elections return board arrive at its decision that Hayes should be awarded their state's electoral votes. This ended Sherman's direct role in the matter, and he returned to Washington, but the dispute carried over until a bipartisan election commission was convened in the capital. A few days before Grant's term would end, the commission narrowly decided in Hayes's favor, and he became the 19th President of the United States.

Sherman's financial expertise and his friendship with Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring all of them to committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.

Sherman and Hayes agreed to stockpile gold in preparation for the exchange of greenbacks for specie. The Act remained unpopular in some quarters, leading to four attempts to repeal it in the Senate and fourteen in the House—all unsuccessful. By this time, public confidence in the Treasury had grown to the extent that a dollar in gold was worth only $1.05 in greenbacks. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for gold, few actually did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were redeemed. Greenbacks were now at parity with gold dollars, and the nation had, for the first time since the Civil War, a unified monetary system.

Sentiment against the Coinage Act of 1873 gained strength as the economy worsened following the Panic of 1873. Democratic Representative <a href="Richard%20P.%20Bland">Richard P. Bland</a> of Missouri proposed a bill that would require the United States buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors. In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents and receive back a silver dollar. The pro-silver idea cut across party lines, and <a href="William%20B.%20Allison">William B. Allison</a>, a Republican from Iowa, led the effort in the Senate. Allison offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus the <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a>, or the difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it, accrued to the government's credit, not private citizens. The resulting Bland–Allison Act passed both houses of Congress in 1878. Hayes feared that the act would cause <a href="inflation">inflation</a> through the expansion of the money supply that would be ruinous to business. Sherman's opinion was more complicated. He knew that silver was gaining popularity, and opposing it might harm the party's candidates in the 1880 elections, but he also agreed with Hayes in wanting to avoid inflation.

Sherman pressured his friends in the Senate to defeat the bill, or to limit it to production of a larger silver dollar, which would actually be worth 1/16th its weight in gold. These efforts were unsuccessful, but Allison's amendment made the bill less financially risky. Sherman thought Hayes should sign the amended bill but did not press the matter, and the President vetoed it. "In view of the strong public sentiment in favor of the free coinage of the silver dollar", he later wrote, "I thought it better to make no objections to the passage of the bill, but I did not care to antagonize the wishes of the President." Congress overrode Hayes's veto and the bill became law. The effects of the Bland–Allison Act were limited: the premium on gold over silver continued to grow, and financial conditions in the country continued to improve.

Hayes took office determined to reform the system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the <a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a> since <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> was president forty years earlier. Sherman was not a civil service reformer, but he went along with Hayes's instructions. The foremost enemy of reform—and Hayes—was New York Senator <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a>, and it was to Conkling's spoilsmen that Hayes first turned his attention. At Hayes's direction, Sherman ordered <a href="John%20Jay%20%28lawyer%29">John Jay</a> to investigate the <a href="New%20York%20Custom%20House">New York Custom House</a>, which was stacked with Conkling's appointees. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.

Hayes issued an <a href="executive%20order%20%28United%20States%29">executive order</a> that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, the <a href="Collector%20of%20the%20Port%20of%20New%20York">Collector of the Port of New York</a>, and his subordinates <a href="Alonzo%20B.%20Cornell">Alonzo B. Cornell</a> and <a href="George%20H.%20Sharpe">George H. Sharpe</a>, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. Sherman agreed with Hayes that the three had to resign, but he made clear in a letter to Arthur that he had no personal grudge against the Collector. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements but the Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees.

During a congressional recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and appointed replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues to confirm the President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his <a href="New%20York%20state%20election%2C%201879">campaign for governor</a> of New York. Sherman replied that it was important that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Reeves">Thomas C. Reeves</a> suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York <a href="Political%20machine">machine</a> friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.

Hayes had pledged himself to a one-term presidency, and the Republican nomination in 1880 attracted many candidates, including Sherman. Hayes's preference was for Sherman to succeed him, but he made no official endorsement, and he did not think Sherman could win the nomination. Among the early favorites for the nomination were former President Grant, Senator <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> of Maine, and Senator <a href="George%20F.%20Edmunds">George F. Edmunds</a> of Vermont. Grant did not actively promote his candidacy, but his entry into the race energized his partisans, and when <a href="1880%20Republican%20National%20Convention">the convention</a> met in Chicago in June 1880, they instantly divided the delegates into Grant and anti-Grant factions, with Blaine the most popular choice of the latter group. After Grant and Blaine had been nominated, James Garfield nominated Sherman with an eloquent speech, saying "You ask for his monuments, I point you to twenty-five years of national statutes. Not one great beneficent statute has been placed in our statute books without his intelligent and powerful aid." The speech, while heartfelt, was not particularly stirring. As Senator <a href="George%20Frisbie%20Hoar">George Frisbie Hoar</a> later explained, "[t]here was nothing stimulant or romantic in the plain wisdom of John Sherman".

After the other candidates had been nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third, and no candidate had the required majority of 379. Sherman's delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, but he refused to release them through twenty-eight ballots in the hope that the anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. By the end of the first day, it was clear that neither Grant nor Blaine could muster a majority; a compromise candidate would be necessary. Sherman held out hope that he would be that compromise candidate, but while his vote tally reached as high as 120, he never commanded even all of Ohio's delegates. His divided home-state support was likely fatal to his cause, as Blaine delegates, searching for a new champion, did not think Sherman would make a popular candidate. After several days of balloting, Blaine's men found their compromise candidate, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to his fellow Ohioan, Garfield. By the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield had 399 votes, enough for victory.

Sherman was respected among his fellow Republicans for his intelligence and hard work, but there were always doubts about his potential as a national candidate. As one author described him, Sherman was "thin as a rail, over six feet high, with close cropped beard and possessed of bad teeth and a divine laugh, when he laughs". His public speeches were adequate and informative, but never "of a sort to arouse a warm feeling for John Sherman, the man." Unlike Blaine or Conkling, Sherman "communicated no colorful personality, no magnetic current". His nickname, "the Ohio Icicle," deserved or not, hindered his presidential ambitions.

Garfield placated the pro-Grant faction by endorsing Chester A. Arthur as nominee for <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a>. Despite his good relations with Arthur in 1879, Sherman thought the choice a bad one: "The nomination of Arthur is a ridiculous burlesque," he wrote in a letter to a friend, "and I am afraid was inspired by a desire to defeat the ticket ... His nomination attaches to the ticket all the odium of <a href="political%20machine">machine politics</a>, and will greatly endanger the success of Garfield." He was nearly correct, as Garfield eked out a narrow victory over the Democratic nominee <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>. Sherman continued at the Treasury for the rest of Hayes's term, leaving office March 3, 1881.

The Ohio legislature had elected Garfield to the Senate in 1880, and when he was elected President before taking his seat, they elected Sherman in his place. Sherman's position in the Senate changed after his four-year absence. He rejoined the Finance Committee, but <a href="Justin%20Smith%20Morrill">Justin Smith Morrill</a>, his old House colleague, now held the chairmanship. When Sherman re-entered the Senate in the <a href="47th%20United%20States%20Congress">47th United States Congress</a>, the Republicans were not in the majority. The Senate was divided among 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats, one independent (<a href="David%20Davis%20%28Supreme%20Court%20justice%29">David Davis</a>) who <a href="Congressional%20caucus">caucused</a> with the Democrats, and one <a href="Readjuster%20Party">Readjuster</a> (<a href="William%20Mahone">William Mahone</a>), who caucused with the Republicans. Arthur's tie-breaking vote as Vice President left the Republicans with a narrow hold on the chamber. Even so, the special session convened in March 1881 remained deadlocked for two months over Garfield's nominations because of Conkling's opposition to some of them, resulting in the resignation of Conkling and the other Senator from New York, <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Platt">Thomas C. Platt</a>, in protest of Garfield's continuing opposition to their faction. Sherman sided with Garfield on the appointments and was pleased when the New York legislature declined to reelect Conkling and Platt, replacing them with two less troublesome Republicans.

After the special session of Congress had adjourned, Sherman returned home to Mansfield. He spoke on behalf of Ohio Governor <a href="Charles%20Foster%20%28Ohio%20politician%29">Charles Foster</a>'s effort for a second term and went to <a href="Kenyon%20College">Kenyon College</a> with ex-President Hayes, where he received an honorary degree. Sherman looked forward to staying with his wife at home for an extended period for the first time in years, when news arrived that <a href="Assassination%20of%20James%20A.%20Garfield">Garfield had been shot</a> in Washington. The assassin, <a href="Charles%20J.%20Guiteau">Charles J. Guiteau</a>, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. After lingering for several months, Garfield died, and Arthur became president. After completing a long-planned visit to <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second special session of Congress in October 1881.

Garfield's assassination by an office-seeker amplified the public demand for civil service reform. Both Democratic and Republican leaders realized that they could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system, and by 1882 a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In the previous Congress, Sherman's fellow Ohio Senator, Democrat <a href="George%20H.%20Pendleton">George H. Pendleton</a>, had introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an <a href="civil%20service%20examination">examination</a>, but Congress declined to act on it right away. Republicans lost seats in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201882">1882 congressional elections</a>, in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue, and in the <a href="lame%20duck%20session">lame duck session</a> were more amenable to civil service reform. Sherman spoke in favor of merit selection and against removing employees from office without cause. He was against the idea that civil servants should have unlimited terms of office but believed that efficiency, not political activity, should determine an employee's length of service. Sherman voted in favor of Pendleton's bill, and the Senate approved it 38–5. The House concurred by a vote of 155–47. Arthur signed the <a href="Pendleton%20Civil%20Service%20Reform%20Act">Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act</a> into law on January 16, 1883.

There was relatively little financial legislation in the 1880s. By that time, fewer bonds were necessary, as the government now ran a consistent surplus which by 1882 reached $145 million. Opinions varied on how to <a href="balanced%20budget">balance the budget</a>; Democrats wished to lower tariffs to reduce revenues and the cost of imported goods, while Republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining. They preferred the government spend more on <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> and reduce <a href="excise">excise</a> taxes. Congress passed a law creating a committee to study tariff reduction, but Arthur appointed mostly <a href="protectionism">protectionists</a> to it. In December 1882, the committee submitted a report to Congress calling for tariff cuts averaging between 20 and 25%. The commission's recommendations were ignored, however, as the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">House Ways and Means Committee</a>, dominated by protectionists, provided a 10% reduction. After conference with the Senate, the bill that emerged only reduced tariffs by an average of 1.47%, but it did remove or reduce many excise taxes. Sherman supported the bill, more for the excise reduction than for the tariff changes. The bill, known as the Tariff of 1883 (or, by detractors, as the "Mongrel Tariff") passed both houses narrowly on March 3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law, but it had no effect on the surplus.

Sherman paid greater attention to foreign affairs during the second half of his Senate career, serving as chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">Committee on Foreign Relations</a>. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the <a href="Burlingame%20Treaty">Burlingame Treaty</a> with China, allowing unrestricted <a href="Chinese%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">immigration from China</a>. After the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator <a href="John%20Franklin%20Miller%20%28senator%29">John F. Miller</a> of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 treaty revisions and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's dependence on foreign immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it into law. In 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the <a href="Alien%20Contract%20Labor%20Law">Alien Contract Labor Law</a>, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person under such a contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, as he saw it, was not the national origin of Chinese immigrants, but their employment under serf-like conditions.

In 1884, Sherman again ran for the Republican nomination, but his campaign never gained steam. Blaine was considered the favorite and President Arthur also gathered delegates in an attempt to win the term in his own right. Again, the Ohio delegation failed to unite behind Sherman, and he entered <a href="1884%20Republican%20National%20Convention">the convention</a> with only 30 total delegates pledged to him. Former Cincinnati judge <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Foraker">Joseph B. Foraker</a> gave a speech nominating Sherman, but it drew little attention. Blaine gathered support the next day, and Sherman withdrew after the fourth ballot. Blaine was duly nominated and went on to lose <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884">the election</a> to Democrat <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> of New York, the Republicans' first loss in 28 years. Sherman returned to the Senate where, in 1885, he was elected <a href="President%20pro%20tempore%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">President pro tempore of the Senate</a>. After the death of Vice President <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Hendricks">Thomas A. Hendricks</a> later that year, Sherman was next in line to the presidency until February 26, 1887, when he resigned the position.

In 1886, the Ohio legislature elected Sherman to a fifth term but, before long, he was considering another run for the presidency. To broaden his national image, he traveled to <a href="Nashville">Nashville</a> to give a speech defending Republican principles. He encouraged fairness in the treatment of black Americans and denounced their mistreatment at the hands of the "<a href="Redeemers">redeemed</a>" Southern state governments. The tour had its effect, and Sherman's hopes were high. His old friend, ex-President Hayes, thought him the best candidate. The early favorite for the nomination was again Blaine, but after Blaine wrote several letters denying any interest in the nomination, his supporters divided among other candidates, including Sherman. With no clear consensus going into the <a href="1888%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1888 convention</a>, delegates divided their support among an unusual number of <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a>s. <a href="Daniel%20H.%20Hastings">Daniel H. Hastings</a> of Pennsylvania placed Sherman's name in nomination, seconded by Foraker (who was, by then, Governor of Ohio). Sherman, at last, had a unified Ohio delegation behind him and led on the first ballot with 229 votes—more than double his nearest competitor, but well short of the 416 needed for nomination. <a href="Walter%20Q.%20Gresham">Walter Q. Gresham</a> of Indiana was in second place with 111, followed by <a href="Russell%20A.%20Alger">Russell A. Alger</a> of Michigan with 84. Sherman gained votes on the second ballot, but plateaued there; by the fifth ballot, it was clear that he would gain no more delegates. He refused to withdraw, but his supporters began to abandon him; by the eighth ballot, the delegates coalesced around <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> of Indiana and voted him the nomination. Sherman thought Harrison was a good candidate and bore him no ill will, but he did begrudge Alger, whom he believed "purchased the votes of many of the delegates from the southern states who had been instructed by their conventions to vote for me". A loyal Republican, Sherman gave speeches for Harrison in Ohio and Indiana and was pleased with his victory over Cleveland that November. After 1888, Sherman, aware that he would be seventy-three years old when the nomination was next open, resolved that from then on "no temptation of office will induce me to seek further political honors" and did not run for president again.

For some time, there had been concern about the power of the railroads and the way they charged different rates for different customers. In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by <a href="John%20Henninger%20Reagan">John Henninger Reagan</a> of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline freight rates, required that rates be reasonable, and fixed maximum charges allowed. Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, especially a provision that gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes. Sherman believed the law should allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered. These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Act%20of%201887">Interstate Commerce Act of 1887</a>, owed much to Sherman's influence. Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">Interstate Commerce Commission</a>. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was a boon to farmers and the oil industry.

By the late nineteenth century, businesses began to form combinations, known as <a href="trust%20%2819th%20century%29">trusts</a>, which claimed a larger and larger share of the market—large enough to dictate prices, their detractors claimed. Members of both major parties were concerned with the growth of the power of trusts and monopolies, and at the opening of the <a href="51st%20United%20States%20Congress">51st Congress</a> Sherman proposed what would become the Sherman Antitrust Act. The bill Sherman proposed was largely derivative of a failed bill from the previous Congress written by Senator <a href="George%20F.%20Edmunds">George F. Edmunds</a>, which Sherman had amended during its consideration. Until 1888, Sherman had shown little interest in the trust question but it was rising in the national consciousness, and Sherman now entered the fray. The revised bill Sherman proposed was simple, stating that "[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal". The bill further prescribed criminal penalties for any person who monopolizes trade. In debate, Sherman praised the effects of corporations on developing industry and railroads and asserted the right for people to form corporations, so long as they were "not in any sense a monopoly".

The bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming 52–1 vote and passed the House without dissent. President Harrison signed the bill into law on July 2, 1890. Sherman was the prime mover in getting the bill passed and became "by far the most articulate spokesman for antitrust in Congress". The Act was later criticized for its simple language and lack of defined terms, but Sherman defended it, saying that it drew on common-law language and precedents. He also denied that the Act was anti-business at all, saying that it only opposed unfair business practices. Sherman emphasized that the Act aimed not at lawful competition, but at illegal combination. The later analysis was more generous: "The Sherman Act was as good an antitrust law as the Congress of 1890 could have devised."

Since the passage of the Bland–Allison Act in 1878, there had been little discussion of gold versus silver coinage. Silver had been hardly mentioned in the 1888 campaign, and Harrison's exact position on the issue was initially unclear, but his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, <a href="William%20Windom">William Windom</a>, encouraged the <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a> supporters. Silver supporters' numbers had grown in Congress with the addition of new Western states. The drop in agricultural prices, which made farmers' debts harder to pay, broadened their cause's appeal. Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold. This served only to disappoint both factions. Windom suggested keeping the Bland–Allison system, but doubling the amount of silver allowed to be coined. The intrinsic value of the silver dollar had fallen to 72.3 cents, but Windom believed (though gold supporters doubted) that coining more silver would increase demand and raise its value. Harrison was willing to sign whatever bill would satisfy the largest group of people, as long as it did not make the currency unsound.

Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, but their solutions differed. The House passed a bill in June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver each month (in addition to the $2 – $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican <a href="Preston%20B.%20Plumb">Preston B. Plumb</a> of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but was appointed to the conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of silver and would issue <a href="Treasury%20%28Coin%29%20Note">Treasury Notes</a> to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or silver. The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.

In 1893, a <a href="Panic%20of%201893">financial panic</a> struck the stock market, and the nation soon faced an acute <a href="economic%20depression">economic depression</a>. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the increased coinage of silver, and President Cleveland, who had replaced Harrison that March, called Congress into session and demanded repeal of the part of the Act requiring the government to purchase silver. The effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repeal; even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver purchase was equally contentious, but Cleveland convinced enough Democrats to stand by him that they, along with eastern Republicans, formed a 48–37 majority. Sherman voted for repeal of "his" bill. After repeal, depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, but at a lesser rate and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. Academic debate continues over the efficacy of the bond issues, but the consensus is that the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act was, at worst, unharmful and, at best, useful in restoring the nation's financial health.

Sherman was elected in 1892 to a sixth term, easily defeating the Democratic candidate in the state legislature. The more difficult fight had been for the Republican caucus's vote, as many preferred Foraker to Sherman. With assistance from Cleveland businessman <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>, and after four days of balloting, the caucus agreed to support Sherman over Foraker, and he was reelected by the full legislature on January 12, 1893. In 1894, Sherman surpassed <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Thomas Hart Benton</a>'s record for longest tenure in the Senate. His memoirs, "Recollections of Forty Years in the House, Senate and Cabinet", were published the following year. In 1896 he gave speeches on behalf of fellow Ohioan <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> in his campaign for the presidency, but took a lesser role than in previous campaigns because of his advanced age. McKinley was elected over Democrat <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>. Wishing to see the appointment of Hanna, his friend and political manager, to the Senate, McKinley created a vacancy by appointing Sherman to his cabinet as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>.

In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, facing a difficult re-election campaign in 1898, quickly accepted. His appointment was swiftly confirmed when Congress convened that March. The appointment was seen as a good one, but many in Washington soon began to question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had the strength and intellectual vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for advice on the inaugural address, Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Cuba">Cuba</a>, then <a href="Cuban%20War%20of%20Independence">in rebellion against Spain</a>; the suggestion was ignored.

Both Sherman and McKinley sought a peaceful resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">consul</a> <a href="Fitzhugh%20Lee">Fitzhugh Lee</a> reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship <a href="USS%20Maine%20%28ACR-1%29">USS "Maine"</a> there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the "Maine" exploded and sank with 266 men killed.

War fever ran high, and by April, McKinley reported to Congress that efforts at diplomatic resolution had failed; a week later, Congress <a href="United%20States%20declaration%20of%20war%20upon%20Spain">declared war</a>. By this time, McKinley had begun to rely on Assistant Secretary of State <a href="William%20R.%20Day">William R. Day</a> for day-to-day management of the State Department, and was even inviting him to cabinet meetings, as Sherman had stopped attending them. Day, a McKinley associate of long standing, superseded his boss as the real power in the State Department. Sherman, sensing that he was being made a mere figurehead and recognizing, at last, his declining health and worsening memory, resigned his office on April 25, 1898.

Sherman retired from public life after resigning as Secretary of State. Except for one day, Sherman had spent the previous forty-two years, four months, and twenty-two days in government service. He gave a few interviews in which he disagreed with the administration's policy of <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20Campaign">annexing Puerto Rico</a> and <a href="Philippine%E2%80%93American%20War">the Philippines</a>. Later that year, his wife, Margaret, had a stroke; she died two years later on June 5, 1900. Sherman continued to alternate between houses in Mansfield and Washington. He mostly remained out of politics, except for a letter he wrote endorsing <a href="George%20K.%20Nash">George K. Nash</a> for Governor of Ohio in 1899. Sherman died at his Washington home on October 22, 1900, in the company of his daughter, relatives and friends. After a funeral at <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%2C%20Lafayette%20Square%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">St. John's Episcopal Church</a> in Washington, he was interred in Mansfield City Cemetery with his wife.

Sherman was not unmindful of his legacy and left $10,000 in his will for a biography to be written "by some competent person". Two biographies were published shortly after that, but neither mentions the bequest. In 1906, Congressman <a href="Theodore%20E.%20Burton">Theodore E. Burton</a> of Ohio published a biography; two years later, former Representative <a href="Winfield%20S.%20Kerr">Winfield S. Kerr</a> of Mansfield published another. Both were very favorable to Sherman. A scholarly biography was said to be in preparation in Allan Nevins's "American Political Leaders" series of the 1920s and 1930s, to be written by <a href="Roy%20Franklin%20Nichols">Roy Franklin Nichols</a> and his wife, Jeanette Paddock Nichols, but the work was never completed. Jeanette Nichols later published several articles on Sherman in the next few decades, but he still awaits a full-length scholarly biography. He is most remembered now for the antitrust act that bears his name. Burton, in summing up his subject, wrote:

Frank Headlam

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Frank Headlam, (15 July 1914 – 23 December 1976) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Born and educated in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, he joined the RAAF as an air cadet in January 1934. He specialised in flying instruction and navigation before the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20in%20World%20War%20II">outbreak of World War II</a>. In April 1941, he became commanding officer of <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s. The squadron was deployed to <a href="West%20Timor">Dutch Timor</a> in December, and saw action against <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> forces in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>. After returning to Australia in February 1942, Headlam held staff appointments and training commands, finishing the war a <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>.

Headlam served as Officer Commanding <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a> in 1946, and as Director of Training from 1947 to 1950. In 1950–51, during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, he was stationed at Singapore as commander of <a href="No.%2090%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 90 (Composite) Wing</a> and, later, <a href="Tengah%20Air%20Base">RAF Tengah</a>. He twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel, in 1957 and 1959–60, receiving appointment as a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1958. Promoted air vice marshal, he successively held the positions of <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Operational Command</a> in 1961–62, AOC <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">No. 224 Group RAF</a> from 1962 to 1965 during the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia–Malaysia "Konfrontasi"</a>, <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> in 1965–66, and AOC <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a> in 1966–67. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1965. Following a posting to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff from 1968 to 1971, he retired from the Air Force and died in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> five years later.

The son of farmers Malcolm and Hilda Headlam, Frank Headlam was born on 15 July 1914 in <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a>, Tasmania. He was schooled at Clemes College, <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>, and <a href="Matriculation">matriculated</a> in 1932. Against the wishes of his parents he joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) as an air cadet on 16 January 1934. He underwent flying instruction with <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a> (FTS) at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, and was commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> on 1 January 1935.

After completing a <a href="operational%20conversion%20unit">conversion</a> course, Headlam was assigned to the <a href="Seaplane%20Squadron%20RAAF">Seaplane Squadron</a> at Point Cook. No larger than a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> according to the official history of the pre-war RAAF, Seaplane Squadron was part of No. 1 FTS and operated <a href="Supermarine%20Southampton">Supermarine Southampton</a> flying boats and <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">de Havilland Gipsy Moth</a> floatplanes, among other types. During this posting Headlam was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>, on 1 July 1935, and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with "strong air forces, naval forces (including submarines), and fixed defences, Australia may be made practically invulnerable". According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, this paper "in effect, defined the 'anti-lodgment' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking".

Headlam completed a flying instructors course in July 1936 and joined the staff of No. 1 FTS. He was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on 1 March 1937. Commencing in July 1938, he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF's first Long Specialist Navigation Course, run by Flight Lieutenants <a href="Bill%20Garing">Bill Garing</a> and <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a> at Point Cook. The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention, including a twelve-day, round-Australia trip by three <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s, one of which was piloted by Headlam, in November. The following month, Headlam led the three Ansons on a six-day journey back and forth over <a href="Central%20Australia">Central Australia</a>. He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction. On 27 January 1939 he was posted to <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, as a flight commander. He served initially with <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, before transferring to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> on 29 August. Both units operated Ansons.

Following the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">outbreak of World War II</a>, No. 1 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south-eastern Australia. Headlam continued to serve with the squadron as a flight commander until 15 January 1940, when he was assigned to Headquarters Laverton as the station navigation officer. On 27 March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. He was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> on 1 June 1940. Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul's Anglican Church in <a href="Frankston%2C%20Victoria">Frankston</a>; the couple would have a son and a daughter.

Headlam was given command of No. 2 Squadron at Laverton on 15 April 1941, and raised to <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> on 1 July. Equipped with <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s, the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5 December, when four of its aircraft were ordered to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, in response to fears of <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> aggression in the Pacific. On 7 December, this detachment established itself at <a href="El%20Tari%20Airport">Penfui</a>, near <a href="Kupang">Koepang</a> in <a href="West%20Timor">Dutch Timor</a>, while No. 2 Squadron's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby. The following day, aware that Australia was now at <a href="Pacific%20War">war in the Pacific</a>, one of the Penfui-based Hudsons attacked the Japanese <a href="Pearl%20hunting">pearler</a> "Nanyo Maru", which was suspected of being a radio ship, and forced it aground. By 12 December, Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base, as well as No. 2 Squadron.

During January 1942, No. 2 Squadron's aircraft were dispersed at Penfui, <a href="Buru">Boeroe Island</a>, and Darwin. The Penfui detachment attacked Japanese shipping taking part in the invasion of <a href="Sulawesi">Celebes</a>. Two Hudsons shot down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes that attacked them as they were bombing a transport ship on 11 January; the next day both Hudsons were themselves shot down by <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi Zeros</a>. Penfui was bombed by the Japanese for the first time on 26 January 1942, and attacked regularly thereafter, damaging some aircraft. The intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin but Headlam and his staff remained at Penfui to enable the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia. On 18 February, Headlam was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to demolish the airfield with assistance from <a href="Sparrow%20Force">Sparrow Force</a>. He returned to Darwin the following day, just as the city experienced its first <a href="Attack%20on%20Darwin">raid by the Japanese</a>. Four of No. 2 Squadron's Hudsons were destroyed in the attack; the remainder were relocated to <a href="Daly%20Waters">Daly Waters</a>, where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor.

Headlam remained in Darwin as Controller of Operations at Headquarters <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Command</a> until 12 May 1942, when he was posted to <a href="Nhill%2C%20Victoria">Nhill</a>, Victoria, as commanding officer of No. 2 Air Navigation School, operating Ansons. No. 97 (Reserve) Squadron was formed from the school's personnel in June. On 20 July 1943, Headlam took command of No. 2 Air Observer School (AOS), also operating Ansons, at <a href="Mount%20Gambier">Mount Gambier</a>, South Australia. He was promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> on 1 December 1943, and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No. 3 AOS, operating Ansons and <a href="Fairey%20Battle">Fairey Battle</a>s out of <a href="Port%20Pirie">Port Pirie</a>, on 9 December. After handing over command of No. 3 AOS, he commenced studies at <a href="RAAF%20Staff%20College">RAAF Staff School</a> in <a href="Mount%20Martha">Mount Martha</a>, Victoria, on 2 October 1944. He was appointed senior administrative staff officer at North-Western Area Command on 12 January 1945.

Headlam became Officer Commanding North-Western Area in January 1946. Posted to Britain at the end of the year, he attended the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover</a>, and served with <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a>, London. On his return to Australia, in November 1947, he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters. In November 1950, Headlam was appointed to take over command of <a href="No.%2090%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 90 (Composite) Wing</a> from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Headquartered at <a href="Changi%20Air%20Base">RAF Changi</a>, Singapore, No. 90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>: No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron, flying <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a>s, and <a href="No.%2038%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 38 (Transport) Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>. The Lincolns conducted <a href="area%20bombing">area bombing</a> missions over communist-held territory, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights, VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia, and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo, dropping supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets. Headlam was slightly injured on 20 December, when a No. 38 Squadron Dakota he was co-piloting on a supply drop crash-landed at Kampong Aur in <a href="Pahang">Pahang</a>, following engine failure. In August 1951 he was named commander of <a href="Tengah%20Air%20Base">RAF Tengah</a>, Singapore, in addition to his post as commanding officer of No. 90 Wing. Headlam handed over command of No. 90 Wing in December 1951.

On 19 February 1952, Headlam became senior air staff officer (SASO) at <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area Command</a> in <a href="Penrith%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Penrith</a>, New South Wales. During his term as SASO, the RAAF began re-equipping with <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> jet bombers and <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> jet fighters. The Air Force also underwent a major organisational change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command-and-control system to one based on function, resulting in the establishment of <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Home</a> (operational), <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Training</a>, and Maintenance Commands. Eastern Area Command, considered a "de facto" operational headquarters owing to the preponderance of combat units under its control, was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953. Headlam was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) in the 1954 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> for his "exceptional ability and devotion to duty". He was promoted to <a href="Acting%20%28rank%29">acting</a> <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> in May. His appointment as <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Queen Elizabeth II</a> was announced on 7 October 1954.

Headlam was promoted to <a href="Military%20rank%23Types%20of%20rank">substantive</a> air commodore on 1 January 1955. In November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, and the following year undertook studies at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a>. Returning to Australia, he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the <a href="Department%20of%20Air%20%28Australia%29">Department of Air</a>, Canberra, from 19 March to 21 October 1957, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Fred Scherger</a> and <a href="Allan%20Walters">Allan Walters</a>, and again from 24 August 1959 to 28 March 1960, between the terms of Walters and Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Hely">Bill Hely</a>. In this role Headlam occupied a seat on the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>. He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee, chaired by businessman William John Allison, examining conditions of defence service; the committee's recommendations led to a doubling of flight pay, among other improvements. Headlam's other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959, and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959. The latter assignment put him in charge of the RAAF's Directorate of Intelligence. Headlam was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1958 <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a>, <a href="The%20London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 3 June. In May 1960 he became acting <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>.
On 30 January 1961, Headlam joined the staff of Operational Command (OPCOM), the successor organisation to Home Command, responsible for the direction of RAAF operational units. He took over as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) OPCOM from Air Vice Marshal <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Val Hancock</a> in April. Headlam was promoted to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> on 29 May. On 17 July 1962, he was posted to <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">RAAF Base Butterworth</a>, Malaya, and took up the appointment of AOC <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">No. 224 Group RAF</a> in Singapore one week later. He was succeeded as AOC OPCOM by Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch. As AOC No. 224 Group, Headlam had overall responsibility for regional air defence and offensive air operations during the <a href="Brunei%20Revolt">Brunei Rebellion</a> in December 1962, and the subsequent <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20Confrontation">"Konfrontasi" between Indonesia and Malaysia</a> that officially began the following month. Divorced from his first wife in 1956, he married widowed social worker Vernon <a href="Lou%20Spence">Spence</a> at the Sydney registry office on 20 January 1964. He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal <a href="Christopher%20Foxley-Norris">Christopher Foxley-Norris</a> on 30 November.

Returning to Australia, Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) on 26 January 1965. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) "in recognition of distinguished service in the Borneo Territories" on 22 June. His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> towards the end of his term, and he travelled to <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> with the <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>, Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Wilton%20%28general%29">Sir John Wilton</a>, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co-operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a>, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He served as an <a href="Gentleman%20Usher">Extra Gentleman Usher</a> to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971.

Returning to Australia in June 1971, Headlam took resettlement leave before retiring from the Air Force on 3 August. He made his home in Melbourne, where he died aged 62 on 23 December 1976, after a lengthy battle with cancer. Survived by his children and his second wife, he was given a private funeral and cremated at <a href="Springvale%20Botanical%20Cemetery">Springvale Crematorium</a>.

Operation Mascot was an unsuccessful British carrier air raid conducted against the <a href="German%20battleship%20Tirpitz">German battleship "Tirpitz"</a> at her anchorage in <a href="K%C3%A5fjorden%20%28Alta%29">Kaafjord</a>, Norway, on 17 July 1944. The attack was one of a <a href="List%20of%20Allied%20attacks%20on%20the%20German%20battleship%20Tirpitz">series of strikes</a> against the battleship launched from aircraft carriers between April and August 1944, and was initiated after Allied intelligence determined that the damage inflicted during the <a href="Operation%20Tungsten">Operation Tungsten</a> raid on 3 April had been repaired.

A force of 44 British <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s and 40 <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> took off from three aircraft carriers in the early hours of 17 July. German <a href="radar">radar</a> stations detected these aircraft while they were en route to Kaafjord, and "Tirpitz" was protected by a <a href="smoke%20screen">smoke screen</a> by the time the strike force arrived. Few of the British airmen were able to spot the battleship, and their attacks did not inflict any significant damage. German losses were limited to a patrol craft, and three British aircraft were destroyed or damaged beyond repair by Kaafjord's defenders. A group of German <a href="U-boat">submarine</a>s attempted to intercept the carrier force as it returned to base, without success. Two U-boats were sunk near the carriers by British patrol aircraft and several others were damaged.

In August 1944, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> conducted <a href="Operation%20Goodwood%20%28naval%29">Operation Goodwood</a>, four more carrier raids against "Tirpitz" which also failed and the task of sinking the battleship was transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>.

From early 1942 "Tirpitz" posed a significant threat to the <a href="Arctic%20convoys%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied convoys</a> transporting supplies through the <a href="Norwegian%20Sea">Norwegian Sea</a> to the Soviet Union. Operating from <a href="fjord">fjord</a>s on the Norwegian coast, the battleship was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic. To counter this threat, the Allies were forced to keep a powerful force of warships with the British <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a>, and capital ships accompanied most convoys part of the way to the Soviet Union.
Several air and naval attacks were launched against "Tirpitz" in 1942 and 1943. On 6 March 1942, <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s flying from the aircraft carrier attacked the battleship while she was attempting to intercept <a href="Convoy%20PQ%2012">Convoy PQ 12</a> but did not achieve any hits. Land-based bombers from the Royal Air Force (RAF) and <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Forces">Soviet Air Forces</a> also attempted to strike "Tirpitz" in her anchorages on several occasions in 1942 and 1943, but did not inflict any damage. On 23 September 1943, two British <a href="X-class%20submarine">X-class</a> midget submarines penetrated defences around the battleship at her main anchorage at Kaafjord in northern Norway during <a href="Operation%20Source">Operation Source</a>, and placed explosive charges in the water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to "Tirpitz", putting her out of service for six months.

As "Tirpitz" was still considered a major threat to Allied shipping, the British military sought to damage or destroy the battleship before she could re-enter service. Another midget submarine attack was considered impractical due to improvements to Kaafjord's defences, and the commander of the RAF's <a href="Bomber%20Command%20RAF">Bomber Command</a> refused to attempt <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> raids against the battleship as he believed that such operations were unlikely to be successful and would result in heavy casualties. As a result, the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers were considered the best means of attacking Kaafjord, and the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> directed the fleet to begin planning such a raid in late 1943. Following several months of preparations the Home Fleet's first attack on Kaafjord, which was designated <a href="Operation%20Tungsten">Operation Tungsten</a>, was conducted on 3 April 1944 and involved five aircraft carriers. The two strike forces of 20 <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a> dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters were not detected during their flights to Kaafjord, and the battleship was hit by 15 bombs. "Tirpitz"s crew suffered heavy casualties, but the ship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, the damage inflicted on "Tirpitz"s superstructure, armament and engines was sufficient to put her out of service for several months while repairs were completed. The commander of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>'s "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>", Grand Admiral <a href="Karl%20D%C3%B6nitz">Karl Dönitz</a>, placed a priority on returning the battleship to service so that she could continue to tie down Allied naval resources. He and other senior German officers recognised at this time that the threat of further air attacks meant that "Tirpitz" could no longer operate against Allied convoys.

British intelligence assessed that "Tirpitz" could be repaired within six months, and the Admiralty ordered further carrier-borne strikes against the battleship. First Sea Lord <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Andrew Cunningham</a> did not believe that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking "Tirpitz", but he hoped that further attacks would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. The commander of the Home Fleet, Vice Admiral <a href="Bruce%20Fraser%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fraser%20of%20North%20Cape">Bruce Fraser</a>, initially resisted this order on the grounds that further carrier raids on Kaafjord were unlikely to be successful as "Tirpitz"s defences would have been reinforced and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. Following an argument with Cunningham, Fraser eventually agreed to attack Kaafjord again. Despite the decision to make further attacks on Kaafjord, many of the Home Fleet's airmen were posted to other units following Operation Tungsten. This hindered subsequent operations against German forces in Norway as the new aircrew were less experienced than the men they replaced.

Three raids against "Tirpitz" were cancelled after launch due to unfavourable weather during April and May 1944. The first of these attacks, Operation Planet, began when the Home Fleet sailed from its base at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> in the Orkney Islands on 21 April. This operation involved the same aircraft carriers as had taken part in Operation Tungsten, aside from the substitution of the escort carrier with her sister ship . The fleet reached the position where its aircraft were to be flown off three days later, but the raid was cancelled when Allied agents near Kaafjord reported bad weather over the target area. The fleet then sailed south, and attacked a German convoy near <a href="Bod%C3%B8">Bodø</a>, sinking three merchant ships for the loss of six aircraft. The Home Fleet put to sea to attack "Tirpitz" again in mid-May in what was designated Operation Brawn. A strike force of 27 Barracudas escorted by <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">Vought F4U Corsair</a> and <a href="Supermarine%20Seafire">Supermarine Seafire</a> fighters took off from the carriers and "Victorious" on the afternoon of 15 May, but encountered heavy cloud over Kaafjord and returned without attacking. The next raid, Operation Tiger Claw, was launched in late May. The planned attack on Kaafjord—which would have also involved aircraft flying from "Furious" and "Victorious"—had to be cancelled due to bad weather on 28 May. Instead, the carriers sailed south in search of German convoys. In a raid conducted on 1 June, the carriers' aircraft sank four merchant vessels near <a href="%C3%85lesund">Ålesund</a>. No further attacks were attempted during June as the ships of the Home Fleet were needed to support the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a> that month.

Despite the lack of success, the Admiralty and Admiral <a href="Henry%20Ruthven%20Moore">Sir Henry Moore</a>, who had assumed command of the Home Fleet on 14 June 1944, remained committed to attempting further carrier raids against "Tirpitz". During June, the Admiralty received a series of intelligence reports indicating that repairs to "Tirpitz" were generally progressing well and the battleship would soon be ready to put to sea. Late that month Allied spies spotted "Tirpitz" conducting steaming trials in Kaafjord, and reported that she was capable of sailing at up to and could rotate her main gun turrets. As a result, in late June the Admiralty directed that another aircraft carrier raid be conducted against Kaafjord during mid-July. It was intended that this attack would take place before the resumption of the Arctic convoys, which had been suspended since April 1944 to free up ships for the invasion of France.

As detected by the British, repairs to "Tirpitz" following Operation Tungsten progressed quickly. Work on repairing the battleship began in late April, and 157 shipyard workers and special equipment were transported from <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> in Germany to Kaafjord to accelerate the project. Assisted by the long hours of daylight at Kaafjord's latitude during summer, three shifts of personnel worked on "Tirpitz" each day. The battleship was capable of moving under her own power by 2 June, and ready to begin gunnery exercises at the end of that month. The repair works concluded in mid-July, though the battleship's starboard propeller shaft could only be used to drive her forwards. Captain Wolf Junge assumed command of the battleship in May 1944, replacing Captain Hans Meyer who had been wounded during Operation Tungsten.

As "Victorious" had been redeployed to the Indian Ocean in June, the carriers selected for Operation Mascot were the recently commissioned as well as the veterans and "Furious". The carriers were escorted by the battleship , four <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and twelve <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. Admiral Moore commanded the force from "Duke of York", and the carrier group was led by Rear Admiral <a href="Rhoderick%20McGrigor">Rhoderick McGrigor</a> on board "Indefatigable".

The composition of the striking force was broadly similar to that used in the earlier operations targeting "Tirpitz". "Formidable" embarked No. 8 Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Wing, whose <a href="827%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">827</a> and <a href="830%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">830 Naval Air Squadron</a>s each operated 12 Barracudas, as well as <a href="1841%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1841 Naval Air Squadron</a>, which was equipped with 18 Corsairs. "Indefatigable" carried No. 9 Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Wing, which was also equipped with 24 Barracudas split between <a href="820%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">820</a> and <a href="826%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">826 Naval Air Squadron</a>s, as well as the Seafire-equipped <a href="894%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">894 Naval Air Squadron</a> and <a href="1770%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1770 Naval Air Squadron's</a> 12 <a href="Fairey%20Firefly">Fairey Firefly</a> fighters. In a change from her role in the previous attacks, "Furious" did not embark any Barracudas during Operation Mascot, and instead operated 20 <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F Hellcat</a> fighters from <a href="1840%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1840 Naval Air Squadron</a>, three Seafires assigned to <a href="880%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">880 Naval Air Squadron</a> and three 842 Flight <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> anti-submarine aircraft.

The defences of Kaafjord were improved following Operation Tungsten. Prior to this raid they had comprised eleven batteries of anti-aircraft guns, several anti-aircraft warships and a system of <a href="Smoke%20screen%23Smoke%20generators">smoke generators</a> capable of hiding "Tirpitz" from aircraft. After the attack, additional radar stations and observation posts were established and the number of smoke generators located around the battleship was increased. The improved defences in place by the time of Operation Mascot included a cliff-top observation post near Kaafjord, which was capable of directing the battleship's anti-aircraft guns if necessary. "Tirpitz"s air defences were also strengthened during the period she was under repair by fitting additional cannons, modifying the 150 mm guns so they could be used to attack aircraft, and supplying anti-aircraft shells for her main guns.

As well as the German forces located near Kaafjord, a patrol line of twelve submarines designated Group Trutz was also established around the island of <a href="Jan%20Mayen">Jan Mayen</a> and assigned the task of intercepting any British carrier forces that ventured into the Norwegian Sea. The submarines assigned to this force at the time of Operation Mascot were , , , , , , , , , , , and . The German "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" (air force) had few fighters stationed at bases near Kaafjord, and their operations were constrained by a lack of fuel.

Rear Admiral McGrigor issued an operational memo to the air units selected for Operation Mascot on 4 July, outlining how the attack would be conducted and providing further orders for the raid eight days later. In accordance with these instructions, the flying squadrons assigned to the three carriers undertook training exercises from their ships and shore bases from 4 July onwards. Intelligence gained from decrypting German radio messages during early July, and photos taken by a RAF aircraft on 12 July, provided further evidence that the battleship was once again fully operational and possibly preparing to put to sea. The airmen were informed on 13 July that they would attack Kaafjord in four days time.

The British fleet left Scapa Flow as a single group on 14 July. During the voyage north, the airmen received detailed briefings on the attack plans and terrain around Kaafjord and were also issued with escape kits to use if they were shot down over Norway. Maintenance personnel also worked to ensure that as many aircraft as possible would be ready. The twelve German submarines in the Norwegian Sea did not make contact with the British force as it sailed north. The weather for much of the voyage was foggy, but the skies were clear when the fleet reached its flying off position to the north of Kaafjord in the evening of 16 July.

The carriers began launching their aircraft shortly after midnight on 17 July. The main striking force comprised 44 Barracudas, with the plan for the raid specifying that No. 8 Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Wing's aircraft would attack before those of No. 9 Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Wing. All but two of the dive bombers were armed with powerful armour-piercing bombs; the other aircraft each carried three bombs. 1841 Naval Air Squadron's 18 Corsairs were assigned to provide protection against German fighters, and the 20 Hellcats and 12 Fireflies operated by 1840 and 1770 Naval Air Squadrons respectively were given the task of suppressing anti-aircraft guns.

After forming up, the bombers and fighters began their flight to Kaafjord at 01:35. The aircraft flew above the sea to evade German radar until they reached a point ten minutes flying time from the Norwegian coast, at which time the Barracudas climbed to and the fighters to higher altitudes. The weather was fine throughout the flight, but clouds were sighted as the aircraft neared the target area.

The British strike force was detected by German radar stations when it reached a point from Kaafjord at 02:00. It took four minutes to pass a warning to "Tirpitz"; her protective smoke generators were in action by 02:13 and quickly covered the vessel in an artificial cloud. The battleship and anti-aircraft batteries located on the shore began firing a barrage towards the British aircraft at 02:19. German forces also began <a href="Radio%20jamming">jamming</a> the British aircraft's radios once they came within of the Norwegian coastline. The smokescreen frustrated the British attack, as the crews of only two of the Barracudas and a pair of fighters managed to spot "Tirpitz" during the raid.

The Hellcats and Fireflies were first to attack, and <a href="Strafing">strafed</a> anti-aircraft positions as well as the destroyer <a href="German%20destroyer%20Z33">"Z33"</a> and small patrol craft "Vp 6307". The patrol craft was forced aground and later declared a total loss. Due to the thick smoke, the fighter pilots were only able to locate targets by aiming at the sources of <a href="Tracer%20ammunition">tracer gunfire</a>.

The Barracudas were targeted by heavy, but inaccurate, anti-aircraft gunfire as they arrived over Kaafjord. Aside from the two aircraft whose pilots sighted "Tirpitz", the 35 other dive bombers attempting to attack the ship were forced to aim at her gun flashes. These bombing attacks took 25 minutes to complete; seven near misses were achieved but no damage was inflicted on "Tirpitz". One of the other Barracudas attacked an anti-aircraft battery, another attempted to bomb a destroyer and a third scored a near miss on the tanker <a href="Nordmark%20%28ship%29">"Nordmark"</a>. Three of the remaining four Barracudas did not find any targets and jettisoned their bombs into the sea; the fourth was unable to drop its bombs due to a faulty release mechanism.

Although German gunners fired a heavy anti-aircraft barrage throughout the attack, they achieved little success. Only one British aircraft, a Corsair, was shot down near Kaafjord; its pilot survived and was taken prisoner. A damaged Barracuda was also forced to <a href="Water%20landing">ditch</a> near "Indefatigable" and its crew were rescued by the destroyer . Several other Barracudas and five Hellcats were damaged during the raid and returned to their carriers. One of the damaged Hellcats was later written off after being judged beyond repair.

A second British raid, which had been scheduled to take off from 08:00 on 17 July, was cancelled two minutes before the aircraft were to begin launching when fog began to build up near the carriers, and the British fleet turned south to return to Scapa Flow. Swordfish and Seafire aircraft flew protective patrols over the Home Fleet throughout the morning's operations.

While the attack on Kaafjord was being conducted, the commander of the German submarines in the Norwegian sea ordered Group Trutz to take up new positions to the south-east of Jan Mayen and intercept the British ships as they returned to Scapa Flow. The Admiralty had anticipated this redeployment, and maritime patrol aircraft from <a href="No.%2018%20Group%20RAF">No. 18 Group RAF</a> were directed to sweep the Home Fleet's route back to its base.

The British patrol aircraft prevented Group Trutz from attacking the Home Fleet. At 21:48 on 17 July, a <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> assigned to <a href="No.%2086%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 86 Squadron</a> detected and sank "U-361"; none of the submarine's crew were rescued. Eight minutes later a <a href="No.%20210%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 210 Squadron</a> <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Consolidated PBY Catalina</a> piloted by Flying Officer <a href="John%20Cruickshank">John Cruickshank</a> spotted "U-347" on the surface. The submarine's anti-aircraft guns damaged the Catalina, killing the navigator and wounding Cruickshank as well as three other crewmen, but the pilot continued his attack and sank "U-347" with depth charges. The Catalina managed to return to base, and Cruickshank was awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for this action. That night the Home Fleet sailed through the gap in the German patrol line that had been opened by the sinking of the two submarines.

Attacks on the German submarines continued for the next six days. On the morning of 18 July a German reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Home Fleet, but the German Naval Command Norway assessed that it was heading north-east to launch another attack. Accordingly, Group Trutz was ordered to sail north, and four more submarines sortied from <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a> to guard the approaches to Alten and <a href="Vestfjorden">Vest fjords</a>. In the evening , one of the four boats that had sailed from Narvik, was attacked twice by Liberators; she shot down the first attacker but was damaged by the second and had to return to port. "U-716" also suffered severe damage from a Liberator attack at 19:15 on 18 July but managed to return to <a href="Hammerfest">Hammerfest</a>. At about 23:00 that day "U-716" was seriously damaged by a <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> but also survived. Three other submarines were attacked on 20 July but only one suffered any damage. Following these actions the commander of submarines in the Norway area decided to dissolve Group Trutz as it was too vulnerable to air attack; all but four of the surviving submarines returned to port and the remaining boats were ordered to sail north so that they were out of range of the British aircraft. The final attack on the submarines of the former Group Trutz was made on 23 July when a <a href="No.%20330%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 330 Squadron</a> Sunderland damaged "U-992" near Vestfjord.

Following the attack on 17 July, the British learned from intercepted German radio transmissions and reports provided by <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a> agents that "Tirpitz" had not suffered any significant damage. Admiral Moore blamed the failure of Operation Mascot on the inexperience of the aircrew involved in the attack, and criticised the strike leader for not selecting alternative targets after it became clear that "Tirpitz" could not be accurately bombed. Moore also judged that further attacks on Kaafjord using Barracudas would be futile, as the dive bombers' slow speed gave the Germans enough time to cover "Tirpitz" with smoke between the time raids were detected and their arrival over the target area. The Admiralty was hopeful that a strategy of repeatedly striking Kaafjord over a 48-hour period would wear down the defences, and Moore agreed to attempt another attack. Consideration was also given to flying fast and long-ranged <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a> bombers off the carriers in an attempt to achieve surprise, but none of these land-based aircraft could be spared from supporting the Allied bombing of Germany.

The next attack on Kaafjord took place in late August. During <a href="Operation%20Goodwood%20%28naval%29">Operation Goodwood</a>, aircraft flying from three <a href="fleet%20carrier">fleet carrier</a>s and two <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s conducted four raids between 22 and 29 August. The attackers found "Tirpitz" covered in smoke on each occasion, and only managed to inflict light damage on the battleship. These unsuccessful attacks cost the British 17 aircraft and 40 airmen killed. The frigate was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine during the operation; the same submarine also inflicted heavy damage on the escort carrier before being destroyed by a British aircraft.

The Admiralty accepted that Barracudas were too slow to be effective against the Kaafjord area following the failure of Operation Goodwood. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to RAF Bomber Command. The first heavy bomber raid against Kaafjord (<a href="Operation%20Paravane">Operation Paravane</a>) was conducted on 15 September 1944, with the bombers flying from staging bases in northern Russia. This attack inflicted irreparable damage on "Tirpitz", and she was transferred south to the <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a> area to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery. The battleship was <a href="Operation%20Catechism">sunk there with heavy loss of life</a> by another Bomber Command raid on 12 November.

Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia

Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia (Olga Nikolaevna Romanova) ( (Velikaya Knyazhna Ol'ga Nikolaevna); – 17 July 1918) was the eldest daughter of the last <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> of the Russian Empire, <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Emperor Nicholas II</a>, and of <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Empress Alexandra of Russia</a>.

During her lifetime, Olga's future marriage was the subject of great speculation within Russia. Matches were rumored with <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Dmitri%20Pavlovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia</a>, <a href="Carol%20II%20of%20Romania">Crown Prince Carol of Romania</a>, <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward, Prince of Wales</a>, eldest son of Britain's <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George V</a>, and with <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia</a>. Olga herself wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her home country. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Olga nursed wounded soldiers in a <a href="military%20hospital">military hospital</a> until her own nerves gave out and, thereafter, oversaw administrative duties at the hospital.

Olga's <a href="Execution%20of%20the%20Romanov%20family">murder</a> following the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> resulted in her <a href="Canonization%20of%20the%20Romanovs">canonization</a> as a <a href="passion%20bearer">passion bearer</a> by the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>. In the 1990s, her remains were identified through <a href="DNA%20testing">DNA testing</a> and were buried in a funeral ceremony at <a href="Peter%20and%20Paul%20Cathedral">Peter and Paul Cathedral</a> in <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> along with those of her parents and two of her sisters.

Olga's siblings were <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Tatiana%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchesses Tatiana</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Maria%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia%20%281899%E2%80%931918%29">Maria</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Anastasia%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia">Anastasia</a>, and <a href="Tsarevich%20Alexei%20of%20Russia">Tsarevich Alexei of Russia</a>. Her Russian title ("Velikaya Knyazhna" Великая Княжна) is most precisely translated as "Grand Princess", meaning that Olga, as an "imperial highness", was higher in rank than other princesses in Europe who were "royal highnesses". However, "Grand Duchess" is the usual English translation. Olga's friends and family generally called her simply Olga Nikolaevna or nicknamed her "Olishka", "Olenka" or "Olya". Among her godparents was her great-grandmother, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Olga was most often paired with her sister Tatiana. The two girls shared a room, dressed alike, and were known as "The Big Pair".

From her earliest years she was known for her compassionate heart and desire to help others, but also for her temper, blunt honesty and moodiness. As a small child, she once lost patience while posing for a portrait painter and told the man, "You are a very ugly man and I don't like you one bit!" The Tsar's children were raised as simply as possible, sleeping on hard camp cots unless they were ill, taking cold baths every morning. Servants called Olga and her siblings by their first names and <a href="patronymic">patronyms</a> rather than by their imperial titles. However, Olga's governess and tutors also noted some of the autocratic impulses of the daughter of the Tsar of All the Russias, one of the wealthiest men in the world. On a visit to a museum where state carriages were on display, Olga once ordered one of the servants to prepare the largest and most beautiful carriage for her daily drive. Her wishes were not honored, much to the relief of her governess, <a href="Margaretta%20Eagar">Margaretta Eagar</a>. She also felt the rights of eldest children should be protected. When she was told the Biblical story of <a href="Joseph%20%28Hebrew%20Bible%29">Joseph</a> and his coat of many colors, she sympathized with the eldest brothers rather than Joseph. She also sympathized with Goliath rather than David in the Biblical story of <a href="David%20and%20Goliath">David and Goliath</a>. When her French tutor, Pierre Gilliard, was teaching her the formation of French verbs and the use of auxiliaries, ten-year-old Olga responded, "I see, monsieur. The auxiliaries are the servants of the verbs. It's only poor 'avoir' which has to shift for itself."
Olga loved to read and, unlike her four siblings, enjoyed school work.
"The eldest, Olga Nicolaevna, possessed a remarkably quick brain", recalled her Swiss tutor, <a href="Pierre%20Gilliard">Pierre Gilliard</a>. "She had good reasoning powers as well as initiative, a very independent manner, and a gift for swift and entertaining repartee." She enjoyed reading about <a href="politics">politics</a> and read <a href="newspaper">newspaper</a>s. Olga also reportedly enjoyed choosing from her mother's book selection. When she was caught taking a book before her mother read it, Olga would jokingly tell her mother that Alexandra must wait to read the novel until Olga had determined whether it was an appropriate book for her to read.

Margaret Eagar also noted that Olga was bright but said she had little experience with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not had an opportunity to shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, <a href="Princess%20Elisabeth%20of%20Hesse%20and%20by%20Rhine%20%281895-1903%29">Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine</a>, died of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'"

"Her chief characteristics … were a strong will and a singularly straightforward habit of thought and action", wrote her mother's friend <a href="Anna%20Vyrubova">Anna Vyrubova</a>, who recalled Olga's hot temper and her struggles to keep it under control. "Admirable qualities in a woman, these same characteristics are often trying in childhood, and Olga as a little girl sometimes showed herself willful and even disobedient." Olga idolized her father and wore a necklace with an icon of St. Nicholas on her chest. She, like her siblings, enjoyed games of tennis and swimming with her father during their summer holidays and often confided in him when she went with him on long walks. Though she also loved Alexandra, her relationship with her mother was somewhat strained during her adolescence and early adulthood. "Olga is always most unamiable about every proposition, though may end by doing what I wish", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 13 March 1916. "And when I am severe — sulks me." In another letter to Nicholas during World War I, Alexandra complained that Olga's grumpiness, bad humor and general reluctance to make an official visit to the hospital where she usually worked as a Red Cross nurse made things difficult. Olga also occasionally found her mother's attitude trying. Parlormaid Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ersberg told her niece that the Tsar paid closer attention to the children than Alexandra did and Alexandra often was ill with a migraine or quarreled with the servants. In 1913, Olga complained in a letter to her grandmother, <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna</a> about her mother's invalidism. "As usual her heart isn't well", Olga wrote. "It's all so unpleasant." <a href="Marie%20of%20Edinburgh">Queen Marie of Romania</a>, who met Olga and her sisters when they visited Romania on a state trip in 1914, commented in her memoirs that the girls were natural and confided in her when Alexandra wasn't present, but when she appeared "they always seemed to be watching her every expression so as to be sure to act according to her desires."

As an adolescent, Olga received frequent reminders from her mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On 11 January 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse "nervous" when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on 12 January 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes had good reason to be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On 24 January 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname "Unmounted Cossack", again: "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even."

Three years later, Alexandra blamed sixteen-year-old Olga, who was sitting beside her seven-year-old brother, for failing to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner. The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused to sit up in his chair, wouldn't eat his food and licked his plate. The Tsarina's expectation was unreasonable, said <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Konstantin%20Konstantinovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia</a>, a distant cousin of the imperial family. "Olga cannot deal with him", he wrote in his diary on 18 March 1912. Court official A. A. Mossolov wrote that Olga was already seventeen, but still "she had the ways of a <a href="flapper">flapper</a>", referring to her rough manners and liking for exuberant play.

Despite his occasional misbehavior, Olga, like all her family, doted on the long-awaited heir Tsarevich Alexei, or "Baby". The little boy suffered frequent attacks of <a href="hemophilia">hemophilia</a> and nearly died several times. Like their mother, Olga and her three sisters were also potentially carriers of the hemophilia gene. Olga's younger sister Maria reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the <a href="hemophilia">hemophilia</a> gene like their mother, who inherited the trait from her maternal grandmother <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not haemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding.

Olga's mother relied on the counsel of <a href="Grigori%20Rasputin">Grigori Rasputin</a>, a Russian peasant and wandering "<a href="starets">starets</a>" or "holy man", and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Olga and her siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as "Our Friend" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Olga's aunt <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a> was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Olga, her sisters and brother, were all wearing their long white nightgowns. "All the children seemed to like him", Olga Alexandrovna recalled. "They were completely at ease with him."

However, one of the girls' governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred. Although Rasputin's contacts with the children were completely innocent, Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future to avoid further scandal. Alexandra eventually had the governess fired. Tyutcheva took her story to other members of the family. Nicholas's sister <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Xenia%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia</a> was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. She wrote on 15 March 1910 that she couldn't understand:

Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, was at first a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. She claimed that she was raped by Rasputin in the spring of 1910. The Empress refused to believe her and said that everything Rasputin did was holy. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but "they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard." Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.

It was whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four Grand Duchesses. Rasputin had released ardent, though by all accounts completely innocent in nature, letters written by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses to him. They circulated throughout society, fueling rumors. Pornographic cartoons circulated depicting Rasputin having relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background. Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine. Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on 17 December 1916. "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916, a few weeks before Rasputin was killed. However, as she grew older, Olga was less inclined to see Rasputin as her friend and was more aware of how his friendship with her parents affected the stability of her country. Olga wrote in her diary the day after the murder that she suspected <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Dmitri%20Pavlovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia</a>, her first cousin once removed and the man she had at one time been expected to marry, was the murderer of "Father Grigory." Dmitri and <a href="Felix%20Yussupov">Felix Yussupov</a>, the husband of her first cousin <a href="Princess%20Irina%20of%20Russia">Princess Irina of Russia</a>, were among the murderers. In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared "cold and visibly terribly upset" by Rasputin's death and sat "huddled up closely together" on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the reverse side by Olga, her sisters and mother. However, Olga was the only member of the family who did not attend Rasputin's funeral, according to the diary of her first cousin once removed <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Andrei%20Vladimirovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia</a>. According to the memoirs of <a href="Valentina%20Ivanovna%20Chebotareva">Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva</a>, a woman who nursed with Olga during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Olga said in February 1917, about a month after the murder, that while it might have been necessary for Rasputin to be killed, it should never have been done "so terribly." She was ashamed that the murderers were her relatives. After Olga and her sisters had been killed, the Bolsheviks found that each was wearing an amulet bearing Rasputin's image and a prayer around their necks.

Inspired by her religious upbringing, Olga took control of a portion of her sizable fortune when she was twenty and began to respond independently to requests for charity. One day when she was out for a drive she saw a young child using crutches. She asked about the child and learned that the youngster's parents were too poor to afford treatment. Olga set aside an allowance to cover the child's medical bills. A court official, Alexander Mossolov, recalled that Olga's character was "even, good, with an almost angelic kindness" by the time she was a young woman.

Olga was a chestnut-blonde with bright blue eyes, a broad face and a turned up nose. She was considered less pretty than her sisters Maria and Tatiana, though her appearance improved as she grew older. "As a child she was plain, at fifteen she was beautiful", wrote her mother's friend <a href="Lili%20Dehn">Lili Dehn</a>. "She was slightly above the medium height, with a fresh complexion, deep blue eyes, quantities of light chestnut hair, and pretty hands and feet."

Olga and her younger sisters were surrounded by young men assigned to guard them at the palace and on the imperial yacht "Standart" and were used to mingling with them and sharing holiday fun during their annual summer cruises. When Olga was fifteen, a group of officers aboard the imperial yacht gave her a portrait of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo's</a> nude <a href="David%20%28Michelangelo%29">David</a>, cut out from a newspaper, as a present for her <a href="name%20day">name day</a> on 11 July 1911. "Olga laughed at it long and hard", her indignant fourteen-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to her aunt <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>. "And not one of the officers wishes to confess that he has done it. Such swine, aren't they?"

At the same time the teenage Olga was enjoying her innocent flirtations, society was buzzing about her future marriage. In November 1911 a full dress ball was held at <a href="Livadia%20Palace">Livadia</a> to celebrate her sixteenth birthday and her entry into society. Her hair was put up for the first time and her first evening gown was pink. Her parents gave her a diamond ring and a diamond and pearl necklace as a birthday present and symbol that she had become a young woman. A. Bogdanova, the wife of a general and hostess of a monarchist salon, wrote in her diary the following summer, on 7 June 1912, that Olga had been betrothed the previous night to <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Dmitri%20Pavlovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia</a>, her first cousin once removed. In his book "The Rasputin File", Edvard Radzinsky speculates that the betrothal was broken off due to Dmitri's dislike for <a href="Grigori%20Rasputin">Grigori Rasputin</a>, his association with <a href="Felix%20Yussupov">Felix Yussupov</a> and rumors that Dmitri was bisexual. However, no other sources mention an official betrothal to Dmitri Pavlovich. Before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, there was also some discussion of a marriage between Olga and <a href="Carol%20II%20of%20Romania">Prince Carol of Romania</a>, but Olga did not like Carol. During a visit to Romania in the spring of 1914, she struggled to make small talk with the Romanian crown prince. Carol's mother, <a href="Queen%20Marie%20of%20Romania">Queen Marie of Romania</a>, was unimpressed with Olga as well, finding her manners too brusque and her broad, high cheek-boned face "not pretty." The plans were, in any event, put on hold upon the outbreak of war in 1914. <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward, Prince of Wales</a>, eldest son of England's <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George V</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia</a> were also discussed as potential suitors, though none were considered seriously. Olga told Gilliard that she wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her own country. She said her parents would not force her to marry anyone she could not like.

While society was discussing matches with princes, Olga fell in love with a succession of officers. In late 1913, Olga fell in love with Pavel Voronov, a junior officer on the imperial yacht "Standart", but such a relationship would have been impossible due to their differing ranks. Voronov was engaged a few months later to one of the ladies in waiting. "God grant him good fortune, my beloved", a saddened Olga wrote on his wedding day, "It's sad, distressing." Later, in her diaries of 1915 and 1916, Olga frequently mentioned a man named Mitya with great affection.

According to the diary of Valentina Chebotareva, a woman who nursed with Olga during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Olga's "golden Mitya" was Dmitri Chakh-Bagov, a wounded soldier she cared for when she was a <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> nurse. Chebotareva wrote that Olga's love for him was "pure, naive, without hope" and that she tried to avoid revealing her feelings to the other nurses. She talked to him regularly on the telephone, was depressed when he left the hospital, and jumped about exuberantly when she received a message from him. Dmitri Chakh-Bagov adored Olga and talked of killing Rasputin for her if she only gave the word, because it was the duty of an officer to protect the imperial family even against their will. However, he also reportedly showed other officers the letters Olga had written to him when he was drunk. Another young man, Volodia Volkomski, appeared to have affection for her as well. "(He) always has a smile or two for her", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 16 December 1916. Chebotareva also noted in her diary Olga's stated "dreams of happiness: "To get married, [to] always live in the countryside [in] winter and summer, [to] see only good people [and] no one official." 
Other suitors within the family were suggested, among them Olga's first cousin once removed <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Boris%20Vladimirovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia</a>. Alexandra refused to entertain the idea of her innocent daughter marrying the jaded, much older Boris Vladimirovich. "An inexperienced girl would suffer terribly, to have her husband 4, or 5th hand or more", Alexandra wrote. She was also aware that Olga's heart lay elsewhere.

Olga experienced her first brush with violence at age fifteen, when she witnessed the assassination of the government minister <a href="Pyotr%20Stolypin">Pyotr Stolypin</a> during a performance at the <a href="National%20Opera%20of%20Ukraine">Kiev Opera House</a>. "Olga and Tatiana had followed me back to the box and saw everything that happened", Tsar Nicholas II wrote to his mother, <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dowager Empress Maria</a>, on 10 September 1911. "…It had made a great impression on Tatiana, who cried a lot, and they both slept badly." Three years later, she saw gunshot wounds close up when she trained to become a <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> nurse. Olga, her sister Tatiana, and her mother Tsarina Alexandra treated wounded soldiers at a hospital on the grounds of <a href="Tsarskoye%20Selo">Tsarskoye Selo</a>.

Olga was disdainful of her cousin <a href="Princess%20Irina%20of%20Russia">Princess Irina of Russia's</a> husband <a href="Felix%20Yussupov">Felix Yussupov</a>, the man who eventually murdered Rasputin in December 1916. Yussupov had taken advantage of a law permitting men who were only sons to avoid military service. He was in civilian dress at a time when many of the Romanov men and the wounded soldiers Olga cared for were fighting. "Felix is a 'downright civilian', dressed all in brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes — a man idling in such times", Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas, on 5 March 1915 after paying a visit to the Yussupovs. She was also strongly patriotic. In July 1915, while discussing the wedding of an acquaintance with fellow nurses, Olga said she understood why the ancestry of the groom's German grandmother was being kept hidden. "Of course he has to conceal it", she burst out. "I quite understand him, she may perhaps be a real bloodthirsty German." Olga's unthinking comments hurt her mother, who had been born in Germany, reported fellow nurse Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva.
Nursing during the war provided Olga and her sister Tatiana with exposure to experiences they had not previously had. The girls enjoyed talking with fellow nurses at the hospital, women they would never have met if not for the war, and knew the names of their children and their family stories. On one occasion, when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break. They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn't know how to buy anything because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store. Yet other stories tell of a regular salary of nine dollars the girls received each month, and how they used it to purchase such items as perfume and notepaper. They had also been shopping with their Aunt, Olga Alexandrovna and Olga had visited shops on a trip to Germany with her sister Tatiana
Olga cared for and pitied the soldiers she helped to treat. However, the stress of caring for wounded, dying men eventually also took its toll on the sensitive, moody Olga's nerves. Her sister Maria reported in a letter that Olga broke three panes of a window on a "caprice" with her umbrella on 5 September 1915. On another occasion, she destroyed items in a cloakroom when she was "in a rage", according to the memoirs of Valentina Chebotareva. On 19 October 1915 she was assigned office work at the hospital because she was no longer able to bear the gore of the operating theater. She was given <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> injections in October 1915, at the time considered a treatment for depression or nervous disorders. <a href="Sophie%20Buxhoeveden">Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden</a>, one of her mother's ladies in waiting, recalled that Olga had to give up nursing and instead only supervised the hospital wards because she had "overtired herself" and became "nervous and anaemic."

According to the accounts of courtiers, Olga knew the financial and political state of the country during the war and revolution. She reportedly also knew how much the Russian people disliked her mother and father. "She was by nature a thinker", remembered <a href="Gleb%20Botkin">Gleb Botkin</a>, the son of the family's physician, <a href="Eugene%20Botkin">Yevgeny Botkin</a>, "and as it later seemed to me, understood the general situation better than any member of her family, including even her parents. At least I had the impression that she had little illusions in regard to what the future held in store for them, and in consequence was often sad and worried."

The family were arrested during the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> and were imprisoned first at their home in Tsarskoye Selo and later at private residences in <a href="Tobolsk">Tobolsk</a> and <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>, <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. "Darling, you must know how awful it all is", Olga wrote in a letter to a friend from Tobolsk. During the early months of 1917, the children caught measles. Olga contracted <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a>, as well.

Olga tried to draw comfort from her faith and her proximity to her family. To her "beloved mama", with whom she had sometimes had a difficult relationship, she wrote a poem in April 1917, while the family was still imprisoned at Tsarskoye Selo: "You are filled with anguish for the sufferings of others. And no one's grief has ever passed you by. You are relentless, only towards yourself, forever cold and pitiless. But if only you could look upon your own sadness from a distance, just once with a loving soul — Oh, how you would pity yourself, how sadly you would weep." In another letter from Tobolsk, Olga wrote: "Father asks to … remember that the evil which is now in the world will become yet more powerful, and that it is not evil which conquers evil, but only love …"

A poem copied into one of her notebooks prays for patience and the ability to forgive her enemies:

Also found with Olga's effects, reflecting her own determination to remain faithful to the father she adored, was <a href="Edmond%20Rostand">Edmond Rostand's</a> "L'Aiglon," the story of <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte's</a> son, who remained loyal to his deposed father until the end of his life.

There was one report that her father gave Olga a small <a href="revolver">revolver</a>, which she concealed in a boot while in captivity at Tsarskoe Selo and at Tobolsk. Colonel <a href="Eugene%20Kobylynsky">Eugene Kobylynsky</a>, their sympathetic jailer, pleaded with the grand duchess to surrender her revolver before she, her sisters, and brother were transferred to Yekaterinburg. Olga reluctantly gave up her gun and was left unarmed.

The family had been briefly separated in April 1918 when the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and Maria to Yekaterinburg. Alexei and the three other young women remained behind because Alexei had suffered another attack of hemophilia. The Empress chose Maria to accompany her because "Olga's spirits were too low" and level-headed Tatiana was needed to take care of Alexei. In May 1918 the remaining children and servants boarded the ship "Rus" that ferried them from Tobolsk to Yekaterinburg. Aboard ship, Olga was distressed when she saw one of the guards slip from a ladder and injure his foot. She ran to the man and explained that she had been a nurse during the war and wanted to look at his foot. He refused her offer of treatment. All through the afternoon, Olga fretted over the guard, whom she called "her poor fellow." At Tobolsk Olga and her sisters had sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from the Bolsheviks, since Alexandra had written to warn them that upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, she, Nicholas and Maria had been aggressively searched and belongings confiscated.

Pierre Gilliard later recalled his last sight of the imperial children at Yekaterinburg:

At the Ipatiev House, Olga and her sisters were eventually required to do their own laundry and learned how to make bread. The girls took turns keeping Alexandra company and amusing Alexei, who was still confined to bed and suffering from pain after his latest injury. Olga was reportedly deeply depressed and lost a great deal of weight during her final months. "She was thin, pale, and looked very sick", recalled one of the guards, Alexander Strekotin, in his memoirs. "She took few walks in the garden, and spent most of her time with her brother." Another guard recalled that the few times she did walk outside, she stood there "gazing sadly into the distance, making it easy to read her emotions." Later, Olga appeared angry with her younger sister Maria for being too friendly to the guards, reported Strekotin. After late June, when a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more stringent.

On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family and reported that Olga and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the <a href="prayer">prayer</a> for the dead. The following day, on 15 July, Olga and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren't looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was "tumbled and disorderly." They told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House. Olga appeared sickly. As the family was eating dinner that night, <a href="Yakov%20Yurovsky">Yakov Yurovsky</a>, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family's kitchen boy and Alexei's playmate, 14-year-old <a href="Leonid%20Sednev">Leonid Sednev</a>, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him along with the rest of the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence. Dr. Eugene Botkin and Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated them by telling them the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.

Late that night, on the night of 16 July, the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety. The family emerged from their rooms carrying pillows, bags, and other items to make Alexandra and Alexei comfortable. The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw the <a href="taxidermy">stuffed</a> mother <a href="bear">bear</a> and cubs that stood on the landing, perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead. Nicholas told the servants and family "Well, we're going to get out of this place." They asked questions of the guards but did not appear to suspect they were going to be killed. Yurovsky, who had been a professional <a href="photographer">photographer</a>, directed the family to take different positions as a photographer might. Alexandra, who had complained about the lack of chairs for herself and Alexei, sat to her son's left. The Tsar stood behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar's right, Olga and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants. They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made. The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard's rules that they must speak in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Olga and her mother attempted to make the sign of the cross and the rest of the family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.

The initial round of gunfire killed only the Tsar, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At that point the gunmen had to leave the room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had released from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her in the back of her head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the jaw.

For decades (until all the bodies were found and identified, see below) conspiracy theorists suggested that one or more of the family somehow survived the slaughter. Several people claimed to be surviving members of the Romanov family following the assassinations. A woman named <a href="Marga%20Boodts">Marga Boodts</a> claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga. Boodts lived in a villa on <a href="Lake%20Como">Lake Como</a> in <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and it was claimed that she was supported by the former kaiser, <a href="William%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a> and by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a>. Prince Sigismund of Prussia, son of Alexandra's sister, Irene, said he accepted her as Olga, and Sigismund also supported Anastasia claimant Anna Anderson. His mother, Irene, did not believe either woman. Most historians discount the claims and consistently believed that Olga died with her family. Michael Goleniewski, an Alexei pretender, even claimed that the entire family had escaped.

 Remains later identified through DNA testing as the Romanovs and their servants were discovered in the woods outside Yekaterinburg in 1991. Two bodies, Alexei and one of his sisters, generally thought to be either Maria or Anastasia, were missing. On 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years old. Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found "shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber." The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes.

Preliminary testing indicated a "high degree of probability" that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, Russian forensic scientists announced on 22 January 2008. The Yekaterinburg region's chief forensic expert Nikolai Nevolin indicated the results would be compared against those obtained by foreign experts. On 30 April 2008, Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing confirms that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters. In March 2009, Dr. Michael Coble of the US Armed Forces DNA Identification Lab published the final, peer reviewed results of the tests on the 2007 remains, comparing them with the 1991 remains, concluding the entire family died together in 1918. Russian and Austrian scientists got the same results. This finding confirms that all of the Tsar's family were accounted for.

In 2000, Olga and her family were <a href="Canonization">canonized</a> as <a href="passion%20bearer">passion bearer</a>s by the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>. The family had previously been canonized in 1981 by the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church%20Abroad">Russian Orthodox Church Abroad</a> as <a href="martyr">holy martyrs</a>.

The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were finally interred at <a href="Peter%20and%20Paul%20Cathedral">St. Peter and Paul Cathedral</a> in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998, eighty years after they were murdered.

Yugoslav torpedo boat T1

The Yugoslav torpedo boat "T1 was a seagoing <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> that was operated by the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> between 1921 and 1941. Originally 76 T", a <a href="250t-class%20torpedo%20boat">250t-class torpedo boat</a> of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> built in 1914, she was armed with two guns and four <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, and could carry 10–12 <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s. She saw active service during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, performing <a href="convoy">convoy</a>, escort and <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> tasks, <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine operations</a> and <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a> missions. She was part of the escort force for the Austro-Hungarian <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> <a href="SMS%20Szent%20Istv%C3%A1n">SMS "Szent István"</a> during the action that resulted in the sinking of that ship by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> torpedo boats in June 1918. Following <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>'s defeat later that year, "76 T" was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed "T1". At the time, she and seven other 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels of the fledgling maritime force.

During the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, "T7" and the rest of the navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly ports, but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets. This ship was captured by the Italians during the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Italian Navy</a> under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">capitulation</a> in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile. She was commissioned by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and after a refit which included replacement of her armament, she served as Golešnica until 1959.

In 1910, the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a coastal <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>, specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the <a href="Strait%20of%20Otranto">Strait of Otranto</a>, where the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> meets the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, would be <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> () base at the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bocche di Cattaro</a> (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. <a href="Steam%20turbine">Steam turbine</a> power was selected for propulsion, as <a href="Marine%20propulsion%23Reciprocating%20diesel%20engines">diesels</a> with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run <a href="Turbo-electric%20transmission">turbo-electric</a> boats. <a href="Stabilimento%20Tecnico%20Triestino">Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino</a> (STT) of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. The T-group designation signified that they were built at Trieste.

The <a href="250t-class%20torpedo%20boat">250t-class</a> T-group boats had a <a href="waterline%20length">waterline length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . While their designed <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a> was , they displaced about fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by two <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> steam turbines driving two <a href="propeller">propeller</a>s, using steam generated by two <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, one of which burned <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and the other coal. The turbines were rated at with a maximum output of and designed to drive the boats to a top speed of . They carried of coal and of fuel oil, which gave them a range of at . The T-group had one <a href="Funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> rather than the two funnels of the later groups of the class. Due to inadequate funding, "76 T" and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations. They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.

The boats were originally to be armed with three <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> <a href="%C5%A0koda%207%20cm%20guns"></a> L/30 guns, and three torpedo tubes, but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed, in order to standardise the armament with the following F-group. They could also carry 10–12 <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s.

The third of its class to be completed, "76 T" was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 24 June 1913, <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 15 December 1913 and completed on 20 July 1914. In 1914, one <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> was added.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, "76 T" was part of the 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla. During the war, "76 T" was used for <a href="convoy">convoy</a>, escort and <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> tasks, <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine operations</a>, and <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a> missions. She also conducted patrols and supported <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> raids against the Italian coast. On 24 May 1915, "76 T" and seven other 250t-class boats were involved in the shelling of various Italian shore-based targets known as the <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Ancona">Bombardment of Ancona</a>, with "76 T" involved in the operation against <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a> itself. In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at <a href="Pula">Pola</a> to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the eight T-group torpedo boats, so it is possible that one of these was "76 T". This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.

On 3 May 1916, "76 T" and five other 250t-class boats were accompanying four destroyers when they were involved in a surface action off <a href="Port%20of%20Ravenna">Porto Corsini</a>, near <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, against an Italian force led by the <a href="flotilla%20leader">flotilla leader</a>s <a href="Italian%20cruiser%20Cesare%20Rossarol">"Cesare Rossarol"</a> and <a href="Italian%20cruiser%20Guglielmo%20Pepe">"Guglielmo Pepe"</a>. On this occasion the Austro-Hungarian force retreated behind a <a href="minefield">minefield</a> with no damage to the torpedo boats, and only <a href="Fragmentation%20%28weaponry%29">splinter</a> damage to the destroyer . In 1917, one of her 66 mm guns was placed on an <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> mount. By 1918, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">German</a> and Austro-Hungarian <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s to get through the strait and into the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Miklós Horthy</a>, decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, <a href="scout%20cruiser">scout cruiser</a>s, and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s.

During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of <a href="Pula">Pola</a> in the upper Adriatic with the <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s and . At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the harbour defence barrage opened, the dreadnoughts and , escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including "76 T", also departed Pola and set course for <a href="Slano">Slano</a>, north of <a href="Dubrovnik">Ragusa</a>, to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the <a href="Otranto%20Barrage">Otranto Barrage</a>. About 03:15 on 10 June, while returning from an uneventful patrol off the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coast, two <a href="Regia%20Marina">Italian Navy</a> () <a href="MAS%20%28boat%29">MAS boats</a>, "MAS 15" and "MAS 21", spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. "MAS 21" attacked "Tegetthoff", but her torpedoes missed. Under the command of <a href="Luigi%20Rizzo">Luigi Rizzo</a>, "MAS 15" fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit "Szent István". Both boats evaded pursuit although Rizzo had to discourage "76 T" by dropping <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s in his wake. The torpedo hits on "Szent István" were abreast her boiler rooms, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. "Szent István" <a href="Capsizing">capsized</a> less than three hours after being torpedoed.

"76 T" survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, by which <a href="Republic%20of%20German-Austria">rump Austria</a> officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class T-group boats, "77 T," "78 T" and "79 T", and four 250t-class F-group boats, she served with the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> (, KJRM; Краљевска Југословенска Ратна Морнарица). Taken over in March 1921, in KJRM service, "76 T" was renamed "T1". When the navy was formed, she and the other seven 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels in the KJRM. In 1925, exercises were conducted off the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coast, involving the majority of the navy. In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser "<a href="SMS%20Niobe">Dalmacija</a>", the <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a> "Hvar" and the submarines and , on a cruise to <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Malta">Malta</a>, the Greek island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> in the Ionian Sea, and <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a> in the <a href="French%20protectorate%20of%20Tunisia">French protectorate of Tunisia</a>. It is not clear if "T1" was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval <a href="attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.

In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when it was <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invaded</a> by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>. At the time of the invasion, "T1" was assigned to the Southern Sector of the KJRM's Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor, along with her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> <a href="Yugoslav%20torpedo%20boat%20T3">"T3"</a> and a number of <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>s and other craft. "T1" was captured by the Italian Navy shortly after the commencement of hostilities and was operated by them under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were also replaced by two L/40 anti-aircraft guns. After the Italians <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">capitulated</a> in September 1943, she was returned by them to the KJRM-in-exile in December 1943. She was commissioned by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> (, Југословенска Pатна Mорнарица) after the war, serving as "Golešnica". Her post-war fit-out included replacing her guns with two guns on single mounts and four guns, and removing her torpedo tubes. She continued in Yugoslav service until October 1959, when she was stricken.

John Plagis

Ioannis Agorastos "John" Plagis, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> & <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> (1919–1974) was a <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>n <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) during the Second World War, noted especially for his part in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%28World%20War%20II%29">defence of Malta</a> during 1942. The son of <a href="Greeks%20in%20Zimbabwe">Greek immigrants</a>, he was accepted by recruiters only after Greece joined the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> in late 1940. Following spells with <a href="No.%2065%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 65 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%20266%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron</a>, he joined <a href="No.%20249%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron</a> in Malta in March 1942. Flying <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> Mk Vs, Plagis was part of the multinational group of Allied pilots that successfully defended the strategically important island against numerically superior <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> forces over the next few months. Flying with <a href="No.%20185%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 185 Squadron</a> from early June, he was withdrawn to England in early July 1942.

After a spell as an instructor in the UK, Plagis returned to action in September 1943 as commander of <a href="No.%2064%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 64 Squadron</a>, flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France. He took command of <a href="No.%20126%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 126 (Persian Gulf) Squadron</a> in June 1944, and led many attacks on German positions during the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of France</a> and the <a href="Allied%20advance%20from%20Paris%20to%20the%20Rhine">campaign</a> that followed; he was shot down over <a href="Arnhem">Arnhem</a> during <a href="Operation%20Market%20Garden">Operation "Market Garden"</a>, but only lightly wounded. After converting to <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">Mustang IIIs</a>, he commanded a <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a> based at <a href="RAF%20Bentwaters">RAF Bentwaters</a> that supported bombing missions. He finished the war with the rank of <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> and remained with the RAF afterwards, operating <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a>s at the head of No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron.

Plagis was the top-scoring Southern Rhodesian ace of the war, and the highest-scoring ace of Greek origin, with 16 confirmed aerial victories, including 11 over Malta. Awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and other medals, he was also one of Rhodesia's most decorated veterans. The Southern Rhodesian capital, <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, honoured his wartime contributions by naming a street in its northern <a href="Alexandra%20Park%2C%20Harare">Alexandra Park</a> neighbourhood after him. On his return home after retiring from the RAF with the rank of <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in 1948, he set up home at 1 John Plagis Avenue, opened a <a href="liquor%20store">bottle store</a> bearing his name, and was a director of several companies, including <a href="Central%20African%20Airways">Central African Airways</a> in the 1960s. He contested the Salisbury City constituency in the 1962 <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201962">general election</a>, running for the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a>, but failed to win. He died in 1974, reportedly by suicide.

John Plagis was born on 10 March 1919 in <a href="Gadzema">Gadzema</a>, a mining village near <a href="Chegutu">Hartley</a>, about south-west of the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>n capital <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>. His parents, Agorastos and Helen Plagis, were <a href="Greeks%20in%20Zimbabwe">Greek immigrants</a> from the island of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>; he had five siblings. Christened with the Greek name Ioannis Agorastos, Plagis used the English form of Ioannis, John, from childhood, and attended <a href="Prince%20Edward%20School">Prince Edward School</a> in Salisbury.

Having been interested in aviation since he was a boy, Plagis volunteered for the <a href="Rhodesian%20Air%20Force">Southern Rhodesian Air Force</a> (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was turned down because he was the son of foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen, despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life. After Italy <a href="Greco-Italian%20War">invaded</a> Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> side, Plagis applied again—this time to join the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940—and was accepted. Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of <a href="flight%20sergeant">flight sergeant</a> in June 1941 with above-average ratings in all of his flying assessments.

Though he was officially in the RAF as a Greek (he became a Rhodesian citizen only after the war), Plagis considered himself a Rhodesian flyer and wore shoulder flashes on his uniform denoting him as such. He named each aircraft he piloted during the war after his sister Kay, and painted that name on the side of each cockpit. After briefly flying <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfires</a> with <a href="No.%2065%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 65 Squadron RAF</a>, Plagis joined <a href="No.%20266%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron</a>, an almost all-Rhodesian Spitfire unit, on 19 July 1941. He served in the UK for about half a year, during which he was commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a>, before being posted to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean theatre</a> in January 1942.

Plagis's first major operation was Operation "Spotter", the first of many British <a href="Malta%20Convoys">endeavours</a> to reinforce the <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%28World%20War%20II%29">besieged island of Malta</a> in the face of German and Italian assaults during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Mediterranean">Battle of the Mediterranean</a>. Malta was considered to be of vital strategic importance, and its defence was looking increasingly precarious in March 1942. "Spotter" was a plan to strengthen its British garrison with 16 new Spitfire Mk Vs, which would be carried part of the way from <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on the aircraft carrier <a href="HMS%20Eagle%20%281918%29">HMS "Eagle"</a>, then flown to Malta; the pilots would then become part of the severely depleted <a href="No.%20249%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron</a>. The team of pilots comprised eight British airmen, four Australians, two New Zealanders and two Southern Rhodesians—Plagis and his close friend Pilot Officer Doug Leggo.

The operation, carried out on 7 March 1942, was largely successful and 15 of the 16 Spitfires reached Malta. Plagis and Leggo arrived to find a third Rhodesian, Flight Officer George "Buck" Buchanan, already attached to the squadron. A further delivery of 16 Spitfires, Operation "Picket I", was attempted on 21 March, but this was less successful; only nine of the planes arrived. Thirteen Spitfire reinforcement operations were ultimately launched between March and October 1942, playing a key role in the siege. The "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" and the Italian "<a href="Regia%20Aeronautica">Regia Aeronautica</a>" meanwhile attempted to bomb Malta into submission, turning the airfields into "a wilderness of craters, the docks ... a shambles, <a href="Valletta">Valletta</a> a mass of broken limestone ..."

The "Luftwaffe" launched a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, who had not slept for over 24 hours, returned to the airfield in the early hours having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as part of a group of four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bale out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its <a href="slipstream">slipstream</a>, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to "shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, if it takes me a lifetime".
Plagis shot down his first enemy aircraft on 25 March 1942, and on 1 April achieved four more aerial victories in a single afternoon, thereby becoming the Siege of Malta's first Spitfire <a href="flying%20ace">ace</a>. His downing of four enemies in a few hours won him much praise from superiors and reporters, and contributed to his growing reputation as an aggressive but skilful combat pilot. He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) on 1 May 1942, the citation noting that he had "destroyed 4 and probably destroyed a further 3 hostile aircraft". "With complete indifference to odds against him, he presses home his attacks with skill and courage," it continued—"He has set an outstanding example."

On 11 May, Plagis attempted to down an Italian <a href="Reggiane%20Re.2001">Reggiane Re.2001</a> by flying straight at it to ram it; taking erratic evasive manoeuvres, the Italian aircraft <a href="Stall%20%28flight%29">stall</a>ed and almost crashed into the sea. Thinking he had downed the enemy, Plagis claimed afterwards to have achieved an aerial victory without firing a shot, but the Italian flight reported no losses. Plagis's Spitfire was lightly hit during this engagement, and the Rhodesian had some luck returning safely; he landed with only three gallons (14 litres) of fuel left. On 16 May, Plagis and an English ace, Pilot Officer Peter Nash, destroyed a Bf 109 for a shared kill that became No. 249 Squadron's 100th victory over Malta. Amid the continuing siege, the need for a major supply convoy to Malta was becoming urgent; the Governor <a href="John%20Vereker%2C%206th%20Viscount%20Gort">Lord Gort</a> warned Britain in early June that if no supplies came by August, he would have to surrender to prevent a famine.

Plagis was <a href="battlefield%20promotion">promoted in the field</a> to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on 4 June 1942 and transferred to <a href="No.%20185%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 185 Squadron</a> to <a href="Flight%20commander%20%28position%29">command</a> "B" Flight. He shot down two Re.2001s two days later to bring his tally of victories to ten (thereby fulfilling his pledge following Leggo's death), and destroyed a Bf 109 on 7 June. A month later, he received a <a href="medal%20bar">Bar</a> to his DFC, having been adjudged to have shown "exceptional skill and gallantry in combat ... Undeterred by superior numbers of attacking aircraft, he presses home his attacks with great determination." Plagis left Malta when his tour expired on 7 July 1942, flying first to Gibraltar, then the UK. The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with <a href="Operation%20Pedestal">Operation "Pedestal"</a> (known in Malta as the "Santa Marija Convoy").
On arriving in England, Plagis was found to be suffering from <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, <a href="scabies">scabies</a> and physical and mental fatigue. He briefly convalesced in a nursing home, then spent a year as an instructor in England. He was promoted to probationary <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> on 1 October 1942.

Plagis returned to action in September 1943, when he was appointed commanding officer of <a href="No.%2064%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 64 Squadron</a>, then flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France from <a href="RAF%20Coltishall">RAF Coltishall</a> in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. Plagis downed a Bf 109 over France on 24 September 1943, then a <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20190">Focke-Wulf Fw 190</a> on 23 November, and formally received the rank of flight lieutenant on 8 December 1943.

At the start of June 1944, Plagis assumed command of <a href="No.%20126%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 126 (Persian Gulf) Squadron</a>, flying Spitfire Mk IXs that had recently been moved from Malta to assist in the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>. Six of the squadron's planes had been purchased by the Persian Gulf Spitfire Fund, and duly named after the donating sheikdoms; Plagis's aircraft, which he chose because of the large letter "K" on its tail (echoing his sister's name), had "<a href="Muscat%2C%20Oman">Muscat</a>" painted in English and Arabic script on its side. He added to this a full rendering of "Kay" and other personal decorations.

After leading No. 126 Squadron on raids into Normandy during the Allied invasion, Plagis took part in many of the attacks on German positions in northern France and the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> that <a href="Allied%20advance%20from%20Paris%20to%20the%20Rhine">followed</a> over the next few months. He was shot down over <a href="Arnhem">Arnhem</a> in the Netherlands during <a href="Operation%20Market%20Garden">Operation "Market Garden"</a> in September 1944, but suffered only minor injuries and quickly returned to action. He received the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> on 3 November for his "participat[ion] in very many sorties during which much damage has been inflicted on ... [German] shipping, radio stations, oil storage tanks, power plants and other installations". The citation particularly stressed an engagement in which a small group of Allied fighters led by Plagis had taken on a far superior force of enemy aircraft and shot down five of them, Plagis himself downing two. Plagis was described as "a brave and resourceful leader whose example has proved a rare source of inspiration".

Plagis converted to <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">Mustang IIIs</a> along with the rest of his squadron at <a href="RAF%20Bentwaters">RAF Bentwaters</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> during December 1944 and January 1945, and spent the rest of the war flying bomber escort missions at the head of Bentwaters Wing, which included No. 126 Squadron. He was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> on 28 March 1945. <a href="German%20instrument%20of%20surrender">Germany surrendered</a> on 7 May, <a href="end%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">ending the war in Europe</a>.

Plagis finished the war with a tally of 16 enemy aircraft confirmed destroyed (including two shared victories counted as half a kill each), two shared probably destroyed, six damaged and one shared damaged. This made him Southern Rhodesia's highest-scoring ace of the war, as well as the top-scoring ace of Greek origin. He was one of the most-decorated Southern Rhodesian servicemen of the war.

Plagis stayed with the RAF following the end of hostilities, and from September 1946 to December 1947 commanded No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron in England and Germany, flying <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a> F.3s. He was awarded the <a href="Airman%27s%20Cross">Airman's Cross</a> by the government of the Netherlands in October 1946. After retiring from the military with the rank of <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, Plagis returned home to Southern Rhodesia in 1948. A street in the north Salisbury suburb of <a href="Alexandra%20Park%2C%20Harare">Alexandra Park</a> had been named after him in recognition of his wartime exploits; he moved into the house at the end of the road, 1 John Plagis Avenue. He married in 1954 and had three sons and a daughter.

Plagis set up and ran a <a href="liquor%20store">bottle store</a> bearing his name in Salisbury, and was involved in several businesses during the next three decades, serving as a director on company boards, including <a href="Central%20African%20Airways">Central African Airways</a> from 1963 to 1968. He joined the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> on its formation in 1962, and was its candidate in Salisbury City in that year's <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201962">general election</a>, losing to the <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Federal Party</a>'s John Roger Nicholson by 631 votes to 501. According to a report published by the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union">Zimbabwe African National Union</a> in 1969, Plagis was by then working in the office of the Rhodesian Prime Minister <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a> (<a href="military%20service%20of%20Ian%20Smith">himself</a> a Second World War Spitfire pilot), with responsibility for the premier's written correspondence.

In later life, Plagis became a friend of British ace <a href="Douglas%20Bader">Douglas Bader</a>, a prominent supporter of Rhodesia's <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> in 1965. Bader, Smith and Plagis often socialised. Plagis also knew <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L Ron Hubbard</a>, the American founder of <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a>, who briefly relocated to Salisbury in 1966. Hubbard initiated numerous business schemes in Rhodesia, including the purchase of the <a href="Bumi%20Hills%20Hotel">Bumi Hills Hotel</a> at <a href="Kariba%2C%20Zimbabwe">Kariba</a>. Plagis was one of two local businessmen who partnered with Hubbard in the Bumi Hills deal. He also sold Hubbard an interest in his holdings before the American was deported.

Plagis died in 1974, aged 54 or 55; according to <a href="Lauren%20St%20John">Lauren St John</a>, an author from Gadzema, he had taken his own life, having never truly readjusted to the civilian world.

Samuel Merrill Woodbridge

The Reverend Samuel Merrill Woodbridge, D.D., LL.D. (April 5, 1819 – June 23, 1905) was an American <a href="clergyman">clergyman</a>, <a href="theologian">theologian</a>, author, and college professor. A graduate of <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> and the <a href="New%20Brunswick%20Theological%20Seminary">New Brunswick Theological Seminary</a>, Woodbridge preached for sixteen years as a clergyman in the <a href="Reformed%20Church%20in%20America">Reformed Church in America</a>. After settling in <a href="New%20Brunswick%2C%20New%20Jersey">New Brunswick, New Jersey</a>, he taught for 44 years as professor of <a href="Church%20history">ecclesiastical history</a> and <a href="Ecclesiastical%20polity">church government</a> at the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, and for seven years as professor of "<a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> and <a href="Philosophy%20of%20mind">philosophy of the human mind</a>" at <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers College</a> (now Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey) in New Brunswick. Woodbridge later led the New Brunswick seminary as Dean and President of the Faculty from 1883 to 1901. He was the author of three books and several published <a href="sermon">sermon</a>s and addresses covering various aspects of Christian faith, <a href="theology">theology</a>, church history and government.

Samuel Merrill Woodbridge was born April 5, 1819 in <a href="Greenfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Greenfield, Massachusetts</a>. He was the third of six children born to the Rev. Sylvester Woodbridge, D.D. (1790–1863) and Elizabeth Gould (died in 1851). According to a genealogical chart published in "<a href="Munsey%27s%20Magazine">Munsey's Magazine</a>" in 1907, Woodbridge was in the eleventh generation of a family of clergymen dating back to the late 15th century. The earliest clergyman in this ancestral line, the Rev. John Woodbridge (born in 1493), was a follower of <a href="John%20Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</a>.

Woodbridge attended <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, receiving a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> (A.B.) degree in 1838. As an <a href="Undergraduate%20education">undergraduate student</a>, Woodbridge was a member of the university's secretive, all-male <a href="Eucleian%20Society">Eucleian Society</a> and was elected to <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. He was awarded a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> (A.M.) from the <a href="New%20Brunswick%20Theological%20Seminary">New Brunswick Theological Seminary</a> in 1841 and was installed as a <a href="Minister%20%28Christianity%29">minister</a> by the Reformed Church's Classis of New York, a governing body overseeing churches within the region. At this time, his "<a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>", New York University, promoted his bachelor's degree to a Master of Arts. After his graduation from seminary, he served as <a href="pastor">pastor</a> at the <a href="Bay%20Ridge%20United%20Church">South Reformed Dutch Church</a> in South Brooklyn (1841–49), at the Second Reformed Church in <a href="Coxsackie%2C%20New%20York">Coxsackie, New York</a> (1849–52), and at the Second Reformed Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey (1852–57).

In December 1857, Woodbridge was appointed to the <a href="Faculty%20%28academic%20staff%29">faculty</a> of two schools in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He would serve 44 years as a professor of <a href="Church%20history">ecclesiastical history</a> and <a href="Ecclesiastical%20polity">church government</a> at New Brunswick Theological Seminary (from 1857 to 1901) and for seven years as a professor of "<a href="Metaphysics">Metaphysics</a> and <a href="Philosophy%20of%20mind">Philosophy of the Human Mind</a>" at Rutgers College (from 1857 to 1864). Both schools were then affiliated with the <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> <a href="Reformed%20Church%20in%20America">Dutch Reformed</a> faith. He was appointed by the <a href="Synod%23Reformed%20usage">Synod</a> to a vacancy in both professorates caused by the death of the Rev. John Ludlow, D.D. (1793–1857), on September 8, 1857. During his tenure at the seminary, Woodbridge also provided instruction in the areas of <a href="Pastoral%20theology">pastoral</a>, <a href="Didactic%20method">didactic</a> and <a href="Polemic%23Polemic%20theology">polemic theology</a>—often when there were vacancies amongst the faculty.
In 1883, the church's <a href="General%20Synod">General Synod</a> decided that the "oldest professor in service in the Theological Seminary at New Brunswick be styled Dean of the Seminary, and to him shall be entrusted the discipline of the Institution, according to such regulations as may be agreed upon by the Faculty." Woodbridge led the seminary as its first Dean of the Seminary, and subsequently as President of the Faculty until his retirement in 1901. Both positions were predecessors to the present seminary president. During his career, Woodbridge received <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a>s from <a href="Union%20College">Union College</a> (D.D. 1858) and from Rutgers College (A.M., 1841; D.D., 1857; LL.D. 1883). He retired from teaching in 1901 as an <a href="emeritus%20professor">emeritus professor</a>, at the age of 82.

Woodbridge married twice. His first marriage was to Caroline Bergen (who died in 1861) in February 1845; the couple had one daughter, Caroline Woodbridge (born in 1845). On December 20, 1866 he married his second wife, Anna Wittaker Dayton (1823–1920), with whom he had two daughters, Anna Dayton Woodbridge (born in 1869) and Mary Elizabeth Woodbridge (born in 1872).

Woodbridge died at the age of 86 on June 23, 1905 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was interred in a family plot in the <a href="Elmwood%20Cemetery%20%28North%20Brunswick%2C%20New%20Jersey%29">Elmwood Cemetery</a>, <a href="North%20Brunswick%2C%20New%20Jersey">North Brunswick, New Jersey</a>. Church historian Charles Edward Corwin recorded that Woodbridge was described as having a strong personality that "made dry subjects to glow with life," adding that he "was very firm in the faith but his loving heart made him kindly even toward those whose opinion he considered dangerous."


Various sermons, addresses, and discourses given in public by Rev. Woodbridge have been printed in newspapers and periodicals, as part of a collection of addresses in books, and as separately published pamphlets. These smaller works include:

Frank Jenner

Frank Arthur "Bones" Jenner (surname often misspelled Genor; 2 November 1903 – 8 May 1977) was an Australian <a href="Evangelism">evangelist</a>. His signature <a href="Approaches%20to%20evangelism">approach to evangelism</a> was to ask people on <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Sydney">George Street</a>, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, "If you died within 24 hours, where would you be in eternity? Heaven or hell?" Born and raised in England, he contracted <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">African trypanosomiasis</a> at the age of twelve and suffered from <a href="narcolepsy">narcolepsy</a> for the rest of his life. After some time, he joined the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, but <a href="Desertion">deserted</a> in New York and joined the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. When he was 24, he deserted again while in Australia. He subsequently worked for the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> until he bought his way out in 1937.

That year, Jenner encountered a group of men from the <a href="Glanton">Glanton</a> <a href="Exclusive%20Brethren">Exclusive Brethren</a> who were engaging in <a href="open-air%20preaching">open-air preaching</a>, and he <a href="Conversion%20to%20Christianity">converted to Christianity</a>. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his <a href="Debility%20%28medical%29">debility</a> from <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, Jenner engaged in personal evangelism, probably speaking with more than 100,000 people in total. One person who became a Christian after encountering Jenner's question was <a href="Noel%20Stanton">Noel Stanton</a>, who went on to found the <a href="Jesus%20Army">Jesus Army</a> in 1969.

In 1952, the Reverend Francis Dixon of Lansdowne Baptist Church in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, England, began hearing several <a href="Testimony%23Religion">testimonies</a> from people who became Christians after Jenner accosted them on George Street, Sydney. The following year, Dixon met with Jenner in Australia and told him about the people he had met who had become Christians as a result of Jenner's evangelism, and Jenner, then fifty years old, cried because he had not previously known that even one of the people he had talked to had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith.

Jenner died from <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a> in 1977. While he was alive, very few people knew of him, but after he died, stories of his evangelistic activities circulated widely, and elements of some of these stories contradicted others. In 2000, Raymond Wilson published "Jenner of George Street: Sydney's Soul-Winning Sailor" in an attempt to tell the story of Jenner's life accurately. Nonetheless, conflicting accounts of Jenner's life have continued to propagate, including an account from <a href="Ch%C3%A9%20Ahn">Ché Ahn</a> in which Jenner is referred to as "Mr. Genor".

Frank Arthur Jenner was born on 2 November 1903 in <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, England. His father was a hotel pub owner and former <a href="sea%20captain">sea captain</a>. Jenner had four brothers. According to his posthumous biographer Raymond Wilson, Jenner was <a href="Anti-authoritarianism">anti-authoritarian</a> as a boy and, at the age of twelve, during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, he was sent to work aboard a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> for misbehaving boys. When he was fourteen, the ship sailed from Southampton to <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa. On the way, while the ship was docked at a port in West Africa, a <a href="tsetse%20fly">tsetse fly</a> bit Jenner and infected him with "<a href="Trypanosoma">Trypanosoma</a>"; he therefore contracted <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">African trypanosomiasis</a>, which is also called "sleeping sickness". He subsequently entered a 15-day coma, but eventually recovered. From this point on, he suffered from <a href="excessive%20daytime%20sleepiness">excessive daytime sleepiness</a> and was eventually diagnosed with <a href="narcolepsy">narcolepsy</a>, which prevented him from ever being able to drive a car. When the war ended, he returned to England.

After some time, Jenner joined the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, but <a href="Desertion">deserted</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, United States. He soon joined the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. Jenner's daughter stated in an interview after his death that he learned how to <a href="Gambling">gamble</a> during this time and he soon developed the <a href="impulse%20control%20disorder">impulse control disorder</a> of <a href="problem%20gambling">problem gambling</a>. He became particularly attached to the game <a href="craps">craps</a>, which was popular in the United States at the time. He started to keep a <a href="rabbit%27s%20foot">rabbit's foot</a> in the left upper pocket of his shirt, and would rub it with his left hand while he rolled the dice with his right. His shipmates therefore began calling him "Bones", a nickname that he retained for the rest of his navy career.

When he was 24, his work with the United States Navy involved going to <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and he deserted again, this time in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. There, he met Charlie Peters, who invited him to his home to have a meal with his family including Jessie, Peters' 23-year-old daughter. Jessie and Jenner married a year later, on 6 July 1929, at <a href="HMAS%20Cerberus%20%28naval%20base%29">HMAS "Cerberus"</a>. They continued to live in Melbourne after their wedding and Jenner joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>. He soon became one of the sailors assigned to travel to England to retrieve <a href="HMAS%20Canberra%20%28D33%29">HMAS "Canberra"</a>. He was serving on <a href="HMAS%20Australia%20%28D84%29">HMAS "Australia"</a> in 1937 when he was legally <a href="Military%20discharge">discharged</a> from the navy, buying his way out but not receiving a pension.

In 1939, with the onset of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Jenner was recalled to active duty. Because of his narcolepsy, he was given shore duties in Sydney. In this capacity, he participated in <a href="undercover%20operation">undercover operation</a>s and delivered sealed orders. After the war, he left the navy and became a janitor for <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, a technology and consulting corporation.

In 1937, Jenner encountered a group of men from the <a href="Glanton">Glanton</a> <a href="Exclusive%20Brethren">Exclusive Brethren</a> standing in front of the <a href="National%20Australia%20Bank">National Australia Bank</a> on <a href="Collins%20Street%2C%20Melbourne">Collins Street</a>. One of the men was engaging in <a href="open-air%20preaching">open-air preaching</a>. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's <a href="The%20gospel">good news</a> provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner <a href="Conversion%20to%20Christianity">converted to Christianity</a> and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of <a href="salvation">salvation</a>. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become <a href="Mania">manic</a> or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to <a href="Corowa">Corowa</a> to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers <a href="Social%20rejection">rejected</a> Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.

Later in 1937, Jessie became seriously infected with <a href="boil">boil</a>s and, while under the care of a Glanton Brethren family, became a Christian. Before the end of the year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often <a href="Unemployment">unemployed</a> because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a <a href="peptic%20ulcer">peptic ulcer</a>. At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by <a href="Stress%20%28biology%29">stress</a>, and Jessie's ulcer was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family's lack of money. Consequently, she and Ann moved to <a href="India">India</a> to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the <a href="Kotagiri">Kotagiri</a> Keswick Missionary Home. Ann subsequently attended <a href="Hebron%20School">Hebron School</a> in <a href="Ooty">Ooty</a>, <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, until she was ten years old. Once Jessie had recovered from her illness, they returned to Sydney on <a href="SS%20Oronsay%20%281924%29">SS "Oronsay"</a>.

Jenner would normally wake up to pray at 5 am each day. In the 1940s, Jenner left the Glanton Brethren and joined the <a href="Open%20Brethren">Open Brethren</a>. For the rest of his life, Jenner attended Open Brethren churches: one on <a href="Goulburn%20Street">Goulburn Street</a> in Sydney and the other in <a href="Bexley%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bexley, New South Wales</a>. At these churches, people did not understand what narcolepsy was and thought that Jenner was consistently falling asleep during services because he lacked respect for God. The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches; Jenner actively partnered with <a href="The%20Navigators%20%28organization%29">The Navigators</a>, <a href="Everyman%27s%20Welfare%20Service">Campaigners for Christ</a>, <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a>, <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicans</a>, and <a href="Methodism">Methodists</a>.

Out of gratitude to God for giving him salvation, Jenner committed to consistently engaging in personal evangelism, and aimed to talk with ten different people every day thenceforward. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his <a href="Debility%20%28medical%29">debility</a> from <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, Jenner engaged in this form of evangelism. He probably spoke with more than 100,000 people in total, hundreds of whom made initial professions of commitment to Christianity. He kept <a href="Tract%20%28literature%29%23Religious%20tracts">religious tracts</a> in his shirt pocket where he had previously kept his rabbit's foot, and he often gave these tracts to people he met. He also kept a card in his pocket with <a href="Philippians%204">Philippians 4</a>:13 on it in order to give himself courage in evangelising. This verse reads, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." While engaging in these activities, Jenner would normally wear a white shirt, black shoes, and <a href="trousers">trousers</a>, and sometimes a navy <a href="greatcoat">greatcoat</a>. Usually evangelising on <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Sydney">George Street, Sydney</a>, Jenner asked many people the same question: "If you died within 24 hours, where would you be in eternity? Heaven or hell?" If they were willing to engage in conversation with him, he would invite them either to his home or to a local church. The question became known as "the Frank Jenner question". Jenner was most active in evangelism during World War II. On Saturday nights during the war, Jenner would invite groups of sailors to his home for a service consisting of some hymns and a short sermon.

One of the people to whom Jenner posed his question was <a href="Noel%20Stanton">Noel Stanton</a>, a man from <a href="Bedfordshire">Bedfordshire</a>, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the <a href="Jesus%20Army">Jesus Army</a> in <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had just returned from participating in <a href="Operation%20Meridian">Operation Meridian</a> at <a href="Palembang">Palembang</a> on <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from <a href="Roseville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Roseville</a> who was serving in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any of the people he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.

When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, attempted to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was punched in the midriff by the first person he spoke to, so he decided that Jenner's <a href="Approaches%20to%20evangelism">approach to evangelism</a> was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers, who responded that he was a Christian and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.

The Reverend Francis Willmore Dixon was the head pastor of Lansdowne Baptist Church in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, England, and his youth pastor, Peter Culver, had become a Christian as a result of meeting Jenner on George Street on 2 September 1945. In 1952, at an <a href="All%20Nations%20Christian%20College">All Nations Bible College</a> event, Dixon and Culver heard Noel Stanton's Christian <a href="Testimony%23Religion">testimony</a>, which included the episode in which Stanton had met Jenner. Dixon then realised that Culver and Stanton must have become Christians as a result of the same man. The following year, Dixon heard two different British sailors who did not know each other tell their testimonies at Lansdowne Baptist Church, and both had told very similar stories to Culver and Stanton; both had been walking down George Street and had been asked Jenner's question.

Dixon then travelled to Australia with his wife to engage in <a href="Itinerant%20minister">itinerant preaching</a> there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet know the name of the man he was looking for. In <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street whether or not they were headed for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians as a result of his evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.

After returning from Australia, Dixon went on to discover more people who had become Christians because of Jenner in Bournemouth, <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>, India, and Jamaica. By 1979, Dixon had discovered ten people who had become Christians as a result of Jenner's evangelism. It is because of Dixon that the story of Jenner's evangelism began to be told. Dixon's wife Nancy wrote an account of Jenner's evangelism, which she called "The Jenner Story".

In later years, Jenner developed Parkinson's disease and therefore retired from IBM. With money that Jessie had inherited, the couple moved to Bexley in 1953, where they began attending Bexley Gospel Hall. Towards the end of his life, Jenner developed <a href="dementia">dementia</a> and his narcolepsy worsened. For six months, he was confined to a bed and was treated with <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>. He was then diagnosed with <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a> and spent a subsequent ten days at Calvary Hospital, <a href="Kogarah%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kogarah</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, where he died at 11:45 pm on 8 May 1977 at the age of 73. Because he had befriended so many police officers towards the end of his life, his body was given a <a href="police%20escort">police escort</a> to the burial, which took place at Woronora Lawn Cemetery. His wife died two years later.

While Jenner was alive, very few people knew of him, and the effects of his evangelism were largely unrecognised. After his death, however, stories about his evangelism circulated widely. Stories of his evangelistic activities generated a largely <a href="oral%20tradition">oral tradition</a>, and elements of some stories contradicted others. Many storytellers said that Jenner was small in stature and that he had white hair; this description is contradicted by interviews with family members.

In 2000, Raymond Wilson published a book called "Jenner of George Street: Sydney's Soul-Winning Sailor" in an attempt to tell the story of Jenner's life accurately. Jenner's family had been finding it painful to have alternate accounts of Jenner's life circulating around the world, so they gave Wilson all the information he desired. Wilson wrote that Jenner was "eccentric... the very antithesis of the 'wise', 'mighty', and 'noble'," but that his life was therefore a good demonstration of <a href="2%20Corinthians%2012">2 Corinthians 12</a>:9, which states that God's "power is made perfect in weakness." Wilson wrote that Jenner's question of "heaven or hell" was very similar to that of <a href="Arthur%20Stace">Arthur Stace</a>, another Australian street evangelist who wrote the word "Eternity" on the sidewalks so people would consider where they would be in eternity. Wilson called Jenner a battler and did not recommend that his readers emulate Jenner's evangelistic activities "unless Divinely fitted in a similar way." Wilson wrote that he "travelled and corresponded widely to ascertain the facts of the story" and that he personally verified the accuracy of the information by retrieving first-hand accounts from all of the major figures in Jenner's life. The people Wilson interviewed included Nancy Dixon; Ann and Angus Carruthers, Jenner's daughter and son-in-law; Murray Wilkes; Ian Boyden; Tas McCarthy; Peter Culver; Noel Stanton; and Mary Stares.

Nonetheless, conflicting accounts of Jenner's life continued to propagate at least as late as 2006. In some accounts of Jenner's evangelism, Jenner is referred to as "Mr. Genor". One such account was recorded by <a href="Ray%20Comfort">Ray Comfort</a> on the Living Waters website and then repeated in the 2006 book "Spirit-led Evangelism: Reaching the Lost through Love and Power" by <a href="Ch%C3%A9%20Ahn">Ché Ahn</a>. Ahn is one of the storytellers who refers to Jenner as a "little white-haired man", and Ahn concludes his story by writing that Jenner died two weeks after encountering Dixon, who is not named. These details contradict the information provided by Wilson, who writes in his biography that Jenner died more than twenty years after Dixon told him about the people who had become Christians as a result of his evangelism.

In 2013, Gary Wilkinson produced and directed "The Frank Jenner Question", a <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> featuring interviews with Jenner's daughter and people who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Claire Goodwin encouraged people to emulate Jenner by including an account of his evangelism in her 2013 book "Compelled to Tell: A Fascinating Journey from a New York Dead-End Street to a Lifetime of Ministry and Soul-Winning".

4th Army (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)

The 4th Army was a <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army</a> formation <a href="mobilisation">mobilised</a> prior to the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It was drawn from the peacetime 4th Army District. When mobilised, it consisted of three <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a>, a <a href="brigade">brigade</a>-strength detachment, one horse cavalry regiment and one independent infantry regiment. It formed part of the <a href="1st%20Army%20Group%20%28Yugoslavia%29">1st Army Group</a>, and was responsible for defending a large section of the Yugoslav–<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Hungarian</a> border, being deployed behind the <a href="Drava">Drava</a> river between <a href="Vara%C5%BEdin">Varaždin</a> and <a href="Slatina%2C%20Croatia">Slatina</a>. Like all Yugoslav formations at the time, the 4th Army had serious deficiencies in both mobility and firepower.

Despite concerns over a possible Axis invasion, orders for the general mobilisation of the Royal Yugoslav Army were not issued by the government until 3 April 1941, out of fear that this would offend <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and precipitate war. When the invasion commenced on 6 April, the 4th Army was only partially mobilised, and this weakness was exacerbated by <a href="fifth-column">fifth-column</a> activities within its major units and higher headquarters. Revolts of <a href="Croats">Croat</a> soldiers broke out in all three divisions in the first few days, causing significant disruption to their mobilisation and deployment. The town of <a href="Bjelovar">Bjelovar</a> was taken over by rebel troops. Widespread desertions of Croat troops, many of whom turned on their <a href="Serbs">Serb</a> comrades, made control even more difficult. German activity in the 4th Army sector in the first four days included limited objective attacks to seize crossings over the <a href="Mur%20river">Mura</a> and Drava rivers, along with air attacks by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>.

The formation and expansion of German bridgeheads were facilitated by fifth-column elements of the Croatian nationalist "<a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>" organisation and their sympathisers among the Croat-majority populace of the 4th Army sector. Elements of the 4th Army did put up scattered resistance to the Germans, but it began to withdraw southwards on 9 April, and on 10 April it quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation in the face of two determined armoured thrusts by <a href="XXXXVI%20Panzer%20Corps">XXXXVI Motorised Corps</a> from bridgeheads at <a href="Z%C3%A1k%C3%A1ny">Zákány</a> and <a href="Barcs">Barcs</a>. The <a href="14th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">14th Panzer Division</a> captured <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> late that day, and the Germans facilitated the proclamation of an independent Croatian state. A senior staff officer at the headquarters of the 1st Army Group who sympathised with the "Ustaše" issued orders redirecting formations and units of the 4th Army away from the advancing Germans, and fifth-column elements arrested some 4th Army headquarters staff.

Under the leadership of its commander, "Armijski đeneral" <a href="Petar%20Nedeljkovi%C4%87">Petar Nedeljković</a>, the mostly ethnic Serb remnants of the 4th Army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a>, but were brushed aside by the 14th Panzer Division as it drove east towards <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, which fell on 15 April. A ceasefire was agreed on that day, and the remains of the 4th Army were ordered to stop fighting. The <a href="Supreme%20Command%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">Yugoslav Supreme Command</a> surrendered unconditionally effective on 18 April.

The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> was created with the merger of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro">Montenegro</a> and the <a href="South%20Slavs">South Slav</a>-inhabited areas of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> on 1 December 1918, in the immediate aftermath of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious <a href="Royal%20Serbian%20Army">Royal Serbian Army</a>, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, who saw it as a means by which to secure Serb political <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a>.

The army's development was hampered by the kingdom's poor economy, and this continued during the 1920s. In 1929, King <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Alexander</a> changed the name of the country to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, at which time the army was renamed the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army</a> (, VKJ). The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on <a href="working%20animal">draught animals</a> for transport, and the large size of its <a href="military%20organisation">formations</a>. <a href="Infantry">Infantry</a> <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> had a wartime strength of 26,000–27,000 men, as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Generals better suited to the <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> of World War I were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist the fast-moving <a href="combined%20arms">combined arms</a> approach used by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germans</a> in their invasions of <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20France">France</a>.

The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within Yugoslavia, resulting from two decades of Serb hegemony and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the disunity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force. <a href="Fifth-column">Fifth-column</a> activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist "<a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>" but also from the country's <a href="Slovenes">Slovene</a> and <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">ethnic German</a> minorities.

Yugoslav war plans saw the 4th Army organised and <a href="mobilisation">mobilised</a> on a geographic basis from the peacetime 4th Army District, which was divided into three divisional districts, each of which was subdivided into <a href="regiment">regiment</a>al regions. <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, <a href="Dugo%20Selo">Dugo Selo</a> and <a href="Sisak">Sisak</a> were key centres for the mobilisation and concentration of the 4th Army due to their good rail infrastructure. Prior to the issue of mobilisation orders for the 4th Army, the 4th Army District headquarters had been involved in planning border defences and conducting exercises for border troops, including demolition plans for bridges and other infrastructure in the event of war.

On 8 June 1940, the <a href="Supreme%20Command%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">Yugoslav Supreme Command</a> had issued orders to the 4th Army District headquarters to make all necessary preparations for defence and <a href="demolition">demolition</a>s and ordered a 14-day exercise for border troops. 4th Army District headquarters submitted a progress report on this work on 30 January 1941. This report indicated that along the Hungarian border, <a href="bunker">bunker</a>s and trenches had been constructed for the immediate defence of the <a href="Drava">Drava</a> river along the Yugoslav-<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Hungarian</a> border, in particular at <a href="Vara%C5%BEdin">Varaždin</a>, <a href="Koprivnica">Koprivnica</a>, <a href="Virovitica">Virovitica</a> and <a href="Slatina%2C%20Croatia">Slatina</a>, but no obstacles such as <a href="Wire%20obstacle">barbed wire entanglements</a> or <a href="Anti-tank%20trench">anti-tank ditches</a> had been developed.

The 4th Army was commanded by "Armijski đeneral" <a href="Petar%20Nedeljkovi%C4%87">Petar Nedeljković</a>, and his <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a> was "Brigadni đeneral" Anton Lokar. The 4th Army consisted of:

Army-level support was provided by the motorised 1st Heavy Artillery Regiment, the 81st Army Artillery Regiment, the motorised 4th <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">Anti-Aircraft</a> Battalion, six border guard <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s and the motorised 4th Army Anti-Aircraft <a href="company%20%28military%29">Company</a>. The 4th Air Reconnaissance Group comprising eighteen <a href="Breguet%2019">Breguet 19</a>s was attached from the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force</a> (, VVKJ) and was based at Pleso airfield near <a href="Velika%20Gorica">Velika Gorica</a> just south of Zagreb. The troops of the 4th Army included a high percentage of <a href="Croat">Croat</a>s.

The 4th Army was part of the <a href="1st%20Army%20Group%20%28Yugoslavia%29">1st Army Group</a>, which was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia. The 4th Army defended the eastern sector along the Hungarian border, and the <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Yugoslavia%29">7th Army</a> along the German and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> borders. The <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">1st Cavalry Division</a> was to be held as the 1st Army Group reserve around Zagreb. On the left of the 4th Army, the boundary with the 7th Army ran from <a href="Gornja%20Radgona">Gornja Radgona</a> on the <a href="Mur%20river">Mura</a> river through <a href="Krapina">Krapina</a> and <a href="Karlovac">Karlovac</a> to <a href="Oto%C4%8Dac">Otočac</a>. On the right of the 4th Army was the <a href="2nd%20Army%20%28Yugoslavia%29">2nd Army</a> of the <a href="2nd%20Army%20Group%20%28Yugoslavia%29">2nd Army Group</a>, the boundary running from just east of Slatina through <a href="Po%C5%BEega%2C%20Croatia">Požega</a> towards <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a>. The Yugoslav defence plan saw the 4th Army deployed in a cordon behind the Drava between Varaždin and Slatina. The planned deployment of the 4th Army from west to east was:

Border guard units in the 4th Army area of responsibility consisted of:

After unrelenting pressure from <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, Yugoslavia signed the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a> on 25 March 1941. Two days later, a military <a href="Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under the VVKJ commander, "Armijski đeneral" <a href="Du%C5%A1an%20Simovi%C4%87">Dušan Simović</a>. A general mobilisation was not called by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. The same day as the coup, Hitler issued <a href="F%C3%BChrer%20Directives">Führer Directive</a> 25, which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state and, on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the invasion.

According to a 1953 <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> study based largely on German sources, by the time the invasion began, the 40th ID was partly mobilised, and the remaining two divisions had only commenced mobilising. The Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić described the mobilisation of the 4th Army as a whole on 6 April as "only partial", and states the headquarters of the 4th Army was mobilising northeast of Dugo Selo, east of Zagreb, with 30–35 percent of the staff officers and 10 percent of the soldiers having reported for duty.

Detachment "Ormozki" was an adhoc formation based on the headquarters of the 1st Cavalry Brigade, with an infantry regiment attached from the <a href="32nd%20Infantry%20Division%20Triglavski">32nd Infantry Division "Triglavski"</a>, and two cavalry regiments and a squadron of cavalry artillery attached from the 1st Cavalry Division. On 6 April, it was concentrating in the <a href="Ormo%C5%BE">Ormož</a> area, as follows:

The 39th Infantry Regiment was later transferred to the 42nd ID, leaving Detachment "Ormozki" predominantly as a cavalry formation.

The 42nd ID had only commenced mobilisation, and was largely in its mobilisation centres or moving to concentration areas. On 6 April, the elements of the division were located as follows:

Orders were issued for the 36th Infantry Regiment to join the 27th ID, replaced by the 39th Infantry Regiment from Detachment "Ormozki". Two artillery batteries from the 40th Artillery Regiment of the 40th ID that were mobilising in Varaždin were ordered to join the 42nd ID.

The 27th ID had only commenced mobilisation, and was largely in its mobilisation centres or moving to concentration areas. On 4 April, Nedeljković had reported that the division could not move for another 24 hours due to lack of vehicles. A small proportion of the division was in its planned positions on 6 April:

The 40th ID was partially mobilised, with some elements of the division still mobilising, some in concentration areas, and only a small proportion actually deployed in their planned positions:

The 43rd Infantry Regiment was ordered to march east to join the <a href="17th%20Infantry%20Division%20Vrbaska">17th Infantry Division "Vrbaska"</a> (17th ID), which was part of the 2nd Army Group's 2nd Army. The 89th Infantry Regiment, originally allocated to the 17th ID, was ordered to march from its mobilisation location in Sisak and join the 40th ID to replace the 43rd Infantry Regiment. The divisional cavalry did not receive sufficient horses, and had to deploy on foot as infantry. The division was without artillery support throughout the fighting because the 40th Artillery Regiment did not complete mobilisation.

Army-level support units were mobilising as follows:

At the time of the invasion, many units of the 4th Army were still at their mobilisation centres or in their concentration areas, and only a few units had actually deployed into their planned positions to defend the border. Many conscripts did not report to their mobilisation centres. The logistics of the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly due to a lack of livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth-column sabotage by the "Ustaše" and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did not even have 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.

<a href="Oberkommando%20des%20Heeres">German Army headquarters</a> wanted to capture the bridges over the Drava intact, and from 1 April had issued orders to the <a href="2nd%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">2nd Army</a> to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridges at Barcs and <a href="Z%C3%A1k%C3%A1ny">Zákány</a> by "<a href="coup%20de%20main">coups de main</a>". As a result, limited objective attacks were launched along the line of the Drava by the <a href="XXXXVI%20Panzer%20Corps">XXXXVI Motorised Corps</a> of "<a href="General%20der%20Panzertruppe">General der Panzertruppe</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Vietinghoff">Heinrich von Vietinghoff</a>, despite the fact that they were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April. Similar operations occurred on the extreme left flank of the 4th Army, where raiding parties and patrols from <a href="LI%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">LI Infantry Corps</a>, commanded by "<a href="General%20of%20the%20Infantry%20%28Germany%29">General der Infanterie</a>" <a href="Hans-Wolfgang%20Reinhard">Hans-Wolfgang Reinhard</a>, seized high ground on the south side of the Drava.

In the early hours of 6 April 1941, units of the 4th Army were located at their mobilisation centres or were marching toward the Hungarian border. LI Infantry Corps seized the intact bridge over the Mura at Gornja Radgona. About 05:20, the Yugoslav 601st Independent Battalion on the border in the <a href="Prekmurje">Prekmurje</a> region forward of Detachment "Ormozki" was attacked by German troops advancing across the German border, and began withdrawing south into the <a href="Me%C4%91imurje%20County">Međimurje</a> region. About 06:20, Germans troops also crossed the Hungarian border and attacked border troops at <a href="Lendava">Dolnja Lendava</a>. Shortly after this, further attacks were made along the Drava between <a href="%C5%BDdala">Ždala</a> and <a href="Gotalovo">Gotalovo</a> in the area of the 27th Infantry Division "Savska" with the intention of securing crossings over the river, but they were unsuccessful. The Germans cleared most of Prekmurje up to Murska Sobota and <a href="Ljutomer">Ljutomer</a> during the day.

A bicycle-mounted detachment of "<a href="Generalmajor">Generalmajor</a>" <a href="Benignus%20Dippold">Benignus Dippold</a>'s <a href="183rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">183rd Infantry Division</a> captured Murska Sobota without encountering resistance. During the day, the German <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombed and strafed Yugoslav positions and troops on the march. By the afternoon, German troops had captured Dolnja Lendava, and by the evening it had become clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border. XXXXVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Mura at <a href="Mursko%20Sredi%C5%A1%C4%87e">Mursko Središće</a> and <a href="Letenye">Letinja</a>, and over the Drava at Zákány and Barcs. The local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army, who refused to resist Germans they considered their liberators from <a href="Serb">Serb</a>ian oppression during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>. In the afternoon, German <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> "Stuka" <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s of "<a href="Sturzkampfgeschwader%2077">Sturzkampfgeschwader 77</a>" escorted by <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>E fighters caught the Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group on the ground at Velika Gorica, destroying most of them.

The continuing mobilisation and concentration of the 4th Army was hampered by escalating fifth-column activities and propaganda fomented by the "Ustaše". Some units stopped mobilising, or began returning to their mobilisation centres from their concentration areas. During the day, Yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy bridges over the Mura at Letinja, Mursko Središće and <a href="Kotoriba">Kotoriba</a>, and over the Drava at Zákány. These attempts were only partially successful, due to the influence of "Ustaše" propaganda and the countermanding of the demolition orders by the chief of staff of the 27th Infantry Division "Savska", Major Anton Marković. The Yugoslav radio network in the 4th Army area was sabotaged by the "Ustaše" on 6 April, and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting.

Reconnaissance units of the XXXXVI Motorised Corps crossed the Mura at Letenye and Mursko Središće early on 7 April, and captured Čakovec. "Ustaše" propaganda led the bulk of two regiments from the 42nd ID to revolt; only two battalions from the units deployed to their allocated positions. In the face of the German advance, the border troops of the 601st Independent Battalion and 341st Reserve Regiment withdrew towards the Drava.

About 05:00 on 7 April, two to three battalions of the XXXXVI Motorised Corps commenced crossing the Drava at Zákány, and attacked towards Koprivnica. In response to the German crossing at Zákány, the 53rd Infantry Regiment of the 27th ID withdrew towards Koprivnica and took up defensive positions in a series of villages including <a href="Tor%C4%8Dec">Torčec</a>. To stop this German penetration and gain more time for the concentration of the 27th ID, elements of the 27th Artillery Regiment were sent to support the defensive line near Torčec, which was placed under the command of the division's commanding officer for infantry. About 07:30, the commander of the Yugoslav 1st Army Group, "Armijski đeneral" <a href="Milorad%20Petrovi%C4%87">Milorad Petrović</a>, met with Nedeljković at Zagreb and ordered him to go to Koprivnica and prepare a <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a> against the bridgehead, to commence at 15:00. The counterattack plan failed, as the necessary units could not reach their positions.

About 10:30, the Germans reached the defensive line near Torčec, and fighting began. The few remaining Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Zákány. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica with its artillery support, and it remained in the town during the night. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović that he was to attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.

About 19:00 on 7 April, German units in regimental strength with a few tanks began to cross the Drava near Barcs in the sector of the 40th ID. They quickly overcame the resistance of the 2nd Battalion of the 393rd Reserve Regiment, who were affected by "Ustaše" propaganda. The Yugoslavs abandoned their positions and weapons and retreated to Virovitica. The 108th Infantry Regiment of the 40th ID had mobilised in <a href="Bjelovar">Bjelovar</a> and on 7 April was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions. That night, Croat members of that regiment revolted, arresting their Serb officers, <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s and soldiers. The regiment then marched back to Bjelovar, where it joined up with other rebellious units about noon on 8 April.

As the 108th Infantry Regiment was responsible for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry squadron sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local "Ustaše" sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were then able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.

By late evening on 7 April, Petrović's reports to Supreme Headquarters noted that the 4th Army was exhausted and its morale had been degraded significantly, and that Nedeljković concurred with his commander's assessment. During the day, Nedeljković moved his headquarters from Zagreb to Bjelovar.

On 8 April, the German XXXXVI Motorised Corps continued with its limited objective attacks to expand their bridgeheads at Barcs and Zákány, capturing Kotoriba, a village upstream from Legrad. A German regiment broke through the border troops in the sector of the 40th ID, and approached Virovitica. At this point, the entire divisional sector was defended by the divisional cavalry squadron which had been transported there in requisitioned cars due to the lack of horses. Two understrength and wavering battalions of the 42nd Infantry Regiment arrived at <a href="P%C4%8Deli%C4%87">Pčelić</a>, southwest of Virovitica.

In the areas of the 42nd ID and Detachment "Ormozki", the Germans cleared the territory north of the Drava, and border guard units were withdrawn south of the river. On this day, the 39th Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 42nd ID from the Detachment "Ormozki", and the 36th Infantry Regiment of the former joined the 27th ID.

By noon, the rebels of the 108th Infantry Regiment were approaching Bjelovar, where they were joined by elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the 40th ID. The leader of the rebels in Bjelovar was "Kapetan" <a href="Ivan%20Mrak">Ivan Mrak</a>, a reserve aviator. When Nedeljković became aware of the rebels approach, he ordered the local <a href="gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a> commander to maintain order, but was advised this would not be possible, as local conscripts would not report for duty. Headquarters of the 4th Army reported the presence of the rebels to Headquarters 1st Army Group, and it was suggested that the VVKJ could bomb the rebel units. The 8th Bomber Regiment at <a href="Rovine%2C%20Gradi%C5%A1ka">Rovine</a> received a <a href="Operations%20order">warning order</a> to use its <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> Mk I <a href="light%20bombers">light bombers</a> to bomb the 108th Infantry Regiment, but the idea was later abandoned. Instead, it was decided to request that the leader of the <a href="Croatian%20Peasant%20Party">Croatian Peasant Party</a>, <a href="Vladko%20Ma%C4%8Dek">Vladko Maček</a>, intervene with the rebels.

<a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> and the Central Committee of the <a href="League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia">Communist Party of Yugoslavia</a>, then located in Zagreb, along with the Central Committee of the <a href="League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Croatia">Communist Party of Croatia</a>, sent a delegation to 4th Army headquarters urging them to issue arms to workers to help defend Zagreb. <a href="Pavle%20Gregori%C4%87">Pavle Gregorić</a>, who was a member of both Central Committees, went to the headquarters twice, and was able to speak briefly with Nedeljković, but could not convince him to do so. On the same day, Maček, who had returned to Zagreb after briefly joining Simović's post-coup government, agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment of the 40th ID urging them to obey their officers, but they did not respond to his appeal.

Later in the day, two trucks of rebels arrived at 4th Army headquarters in Bjelovar with the intention of killing the staff. The headquarters guard force prevented this, but the operations staff immediately withdrew from Bjelovar to <a href="Popova%C4%8Da">Popovača</a>. After the rebels issued several unanswered ultimatums, around 8,000 rebels attacked Bjelovar, assisted by fifth-columnists within the city. The city then surrendered, and many Yugoslav officers and soldiers were captured by the rebels. When Nedeljković heard of the fall of the city, he called the Mayor of Bjelovar, <a href="Julije%20Makanec">Julije Makanec</a>, and threatened to bomb the city if the prisoners were not immediately released. Detained officers from 4th Army headquarters and the 108th Infantry Regiment were then sent to Zagreb. About 16:00, Nedeljković informed the <a href="Ban%20of%20Croatia">Ban of Croatia</a>, <a href="Ivan%20%C5%A0uba%C5%A1i%C4%87">Ivan Šubašić</a>, of the revolt, but Šubašić was powerless to influence events. About 18:00, Makanec proclaimed that Bjelovar was part of an independent Croatian state.

On the morning of 8 April, the 27th ID was deployed around Koprivnica. The 104th Infantry Regiment supported by elements of the 27th Artillery Regiment was deployed northeast of the town behind the Drava between <a href="Molve">Molve</a> and <a href="Hlebine">Hlebine</a>. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, which had been riding from its mobilisation centre in Virovitica to Zagreb, was allocated to the 27th ID to assist with establishing its forward defences, and was deployed with two artillery batteries between the outskirts of Koprivnica and <a href="Koprivni%C4%8Dki%20Bregi">Bregi</a>. The 53rd Infantry Regiment, and the remnants of the 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 35th Infantry Regiment (totalling around 500 men), and the 1st Battery of the 27th Artillery Regiment were located in the town itself. The 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment had not yet arrived in Koprivnica, and the divisional cavalry squadron had reached as far as <a href="Ivanec">Ivanec</a>. The majority of the 81st Cavalry Regiment, which were army-level troops, were on the road from Zagreb to Koprivnica, although its 1st Squadron, which had been transported to Koprivnica in cars on 7 April, was deployed as part of an outpost line forward of Koprivnica supporting the 1st Battalion of the 53rd Infantry Regiment. The divisional headquarters was located southwest of Koprivnica at <a href="Reka%2C%20Croatia">Reka</a>.

In accordance with Nedeljković's orders, Marić's 27th ID was to undertake a counterattack against the Zákány bridgehead on 8 April. Supported by two batteries of <a href="Skoda%2075%20mm%20Model%201928">Skoda 75 mm Model 1928</a> mountain guns of the 27th Artillery Regiment, the attack consisted of three columns converging on the bridgehead. The right column, attacking from the area of Bregi, was to consist of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment supported by the divisional machine gun company. The centre column, consisting of the 53rd Infantry Regiment and the remnants of the 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 35th Infantry Regiment, directly supported by the 1st Battery of the 27th Artillery Regiment, would attack from Koprivnica. The left column, attacking from the vicinity of <a href="Here%C5%A1in">Herešin</a>, was to consist of the dismounted 81st Cavalry Regiment. Since promised support from the 36th Infantry Regiment, 81st Cavalry Regiment and army-level artillery had not materialised, Marić postponed the counterattack to 16:00. When it was eventually launched, only the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Squadron of the 81st Cavalry Regiment remained in contact with the Germans, south of <a href="Peteranec">Peteranec</a>, and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment held that area throughout the night of 8/9 April, despite heavy German artillery fire. Of the other units involved in the counterattack, most were only at 25 percent of their full strength due to "Ustaše"-influenced desertions sparked by the rebellion within the 40th ID. Two battalions of the 36th Infantry Regiment deserted during 8 April.

By the evening of 8 April, the Yugoslav Supreme Headquarters was under the mistaken impression that the situation in the 4th Army's area of operation was relatively good, believing the penetration of German troops had been temporarily halted. The rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army had a significant effect on the confidence of the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. This was particularly marked in the area of the 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due to the situation in the 4th Army on its right flank, leading to the loss of <a href="Maribor">Maribor</a>.

The Mura sector was quiet on 9 April. The 42nd ID took the 39th Infantry Regiment under command, but the 105th Infantry Regiment and 341st Reserve Regiment began to disintegrate due to desertions. Due to the situation on the right flank of the 42nd ID, 4th Army headquarters ordered it and Detachment "Ormozki" to withdraw from the Drava to behind the <a href="Bednja%20%28river%29">Bednja</a> to conform to the line being held by the 27th ID on its immediate right flank.

On 9 April, the German XXXXVI Motorised Corps completed its preparations for full-scale offensive action by expanding its bridgehead at Zákány. The cavalry units continued to fight the Germans around Peteranec, but the left sector of the divisional front line began to disintegrate. The commander of the right sector, "Pukovnik" Mihailo Georgijević, ordered his troops to hold their positions and went to divisional headquarters to ask approval to discharge the Croats in his units. Marić would not inform 4th Army headquarters of this idea, so Georgijević went to Zagreb to speak to Petrović, and to further urge him to withdraw all troops that still wanted to fight to a line south of the <a href="Sava">Sava</a>. According to Georgijević, Petrović ordered him to tell Marić to consider disarming his Croat troops, and to continue to hold positions on the line of the Bilogora, but to conduct a fighting withdrawal towards Zagreb and Sisak if the German pressure was too great. The intent of these orders was not implemented, as fifth-column elements changed the wording so that orders were issued to discharge Croat troops and to retreat towards Zagreb without fighting.

About 09:00, Marić and Marković went to Zagreb to see Petrović, who ordered them to immediately return to their division and continue to resist the Germans. On the return journey, they encountered most of their division withdrawing towards Križevci, with the exception of the cavalry units still fighting north of Koprivnica. Marić halted the retreat, and established positions around <a href="Mali%20Grabi%C4%8Dani">Mali Grabičani</a>, making his headquarters at Križevci. Georgijević dismissed his Croat troops and retreated with the rest of his force towards Zagreb, and the commander of the 104th Infantry Regiment discharged all his troops. In the afternoon, the hard-pressed cavalry units began to withdraw. About 14:00, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment withdrew to Novigrad Podravski via Bregi, but receiving a hostile reception from the Croat population, continued towards Bjelovar. About 18:00, the 1st Squadron of the 81st Cavalry Regiment withdrew via Koprivnica, reaching the rest of the division about 23:00. About 19:00, the Germans occupied Koprivnica without resistance. By evening, Marić's division numbered about 2,000 troops, the 36th Infantry Regiment and 81st Cavalry Regiment were widely dispersed, the 53rd Infantry Regiment had effectively ceased to exist, and his artillery regiment had only two horses to pull guns.

The rebels in Bjelovar used the telegraph station and telephone exchange in the town to issue false orders to parts of the 104th Infantry Regiment directing them to withdraw from their positions. The rebels also contacted the Germans by telephone and sent representatives to meet the Germans at the Drava bridgeheads, to advise them that the roads had been cleared of obstacles, and Makanec invited them to enter Bjelovar. Nedeljković's threats to bomb the town did not materialise, and rebels and deserters began to converge on Bjelovar, bringing with them many Serb officers and soldiers who soon filled the town's jails.

On the morning of 9 April, the German bridgehead at Barcs had expanded to Lukač, north of Virovitica. Following up the withdrawal of the divisional cavalry squadron, the Germans seized <a href="Suho%20Polje">Suho Polje</a>, west of Virovitica, cutting the main road to Slatina, and the rebel Croat troops at Bjelovar made contact with them. By 11:00, the 40th ID front line consisted of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and a troop of the divisional cavalry squadron on the right, and the 4th Battalion of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and a troop of the divisional cavalry on the left. The 3rd Battalion of the 42nd Infantry Regiment was held in depth. The left flank was screened by the rest of the divisional cavalry squadron deployed around <a href="Pitoma%C4%8Da">Pitomača</a>. The 89th Infantry Regiment, marching from its concentration area in Sisak, arrived at divisional headquarters at <a href="Pivnica%20Slavonska">Pivnica Slavonska</a>, to replace the 43rd Infantry Regiment, which had been transferred to the 17th ID.

Other reinforcements included elements of the 4th Army anti-aircraft units sent from Lipik, but the divisional artillery regiment had not completed mobilisation. The rebels in Bjelovar issued false orders to the 1st Battalion of the 42nd Infantry Regiment, directing it to fall back to Bjelovar. At 11:15, Nedeljković arrived at divisional headquarters and shortly afterwards ordered Raketić to launch a counterattack on the German bridgehead at Barcs at dawn the following day. Nedeljković also visited "Divizijski đeneral" <a href="Dragoslav%20Milosavljevi%C4%87">Dragoslav Milosavljević</a>, the commander of the 17th ID on the right flank of the 4th Army; he tried to arrange support from the division during the pending attack, but the majority of that division's troops had yet to arrive from Bosnia, and all it was able to do was advance its left flank, stationing battalions in <a href="%C4%8Ca%C4%8Dinci">Čačinci</a> and <a href="Crnac%2C%20Virovitica-Podravina%20County">Crnac</a> west of Slatina. The 40th ID spent the remainder of the day preparing for the counterattack, but were hindered by German artillery and air attacks. In an indication of the state of his division, during a visit to the front line, Raketić and his chief of staff were fired at by troops of the 42nd Infantry Regiment.

Elements of the 4th Army began to withdraw southwards on 9 April. On the night of 9/10 April, those Croats that had remained with their units also began to desert or turn on their commanders, and in the 40th ID, almost all the remaining troops were Serbs. Due to the increasing momentum of the revolt, Petrović concluded that the 4th Army was no longer an effective formation and could not resist the Germans. Maček issued a further ineffectual plea to calm the rebellion. On the evening of 9 April, "<a href="Generaloberst">Generaloberst</a>" <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Weichs">Maximilian von Weichs</a>, commander of the German 2nd Army, was ready to launch major offensive operations from the bridgeheads on the following day. His plan involved two main thrusts. The first would be spearheaded by the <a href="14th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">14th Panzer Division</a> of "Generalmajor" <a href="Friedrich%20K%C3%BChn">Friedrich Kühn</a> breaking out of the Zákány bridgehead and driving towards Zagreb. The second would see "Generalmajor" <a href="Walter%20Neumann-Silkow">Walter Neumann-Silkow</a>'s <a href="8th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">8th Panzer Division</a> break out of the Barcs bridgehead and turn east between the Drava and Sava to attack towards Belgrade.

Early on 10 April, "Pukovnik" Franjo Nikolić, the head of the operations staff with the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, left his post and visited the senior "Ustaše" leader <a href="Slavko%20Kvaternik">Slavko Kvaternik</a> in Zagreb. He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or deploy to innocuous positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance.

About 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began crossing the Drava, but construction of a bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point, and established a bridgehead. This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment "Ormozki". This crossing, combined with the withdrawal of the 7th Army's <a href="38th%20Infantry%20Division%20Dravska">38th Infantry Division "Dravska"</a> from the line <a href="Slovenska%20Bistrica">Slovenska Bistrica</a>–<a href="Ptuj">Ptuj</a>, exposed the left flank of Detachment "Ormozki". The Detachment attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night 10/11 April, and the 1st Bicycle Battalion left to return to Ljubljana. In the afternoon, the remaining elements of the 42nd ID also began to withdraw though <a href="Vara%C5%BEdinske%20Toplice">Varaždinske Toplice</a> to <a href="Novi%20Marof">Novi Marof</a>, leaving the "Ustaše" to take control of Varaždin.

On the same day, the 14th Panzer Division, supported by dive bombers, crossed the Drava and drove southwest towards Zagreb on snow-covered roads in extremely cold conditions. Initial air reconnaissance indicated large concentrations of Yugoslav troops on the divisional axis of advance, but these troops proved to be withdrawing towards Zagreb. Degraded by revolt and fifth-column activity, the 27th ID numbered about 2,000 effectives when the German attack began. The 14th Panzer Division vanguard reached their positions in the Bilogora range around 08:00, and the remnants of the division began withdrawing towards Križevci under heavy air attack. When they reached the town around 14:00, they were quickly encircled by German motorised troops that had outflanked them. The divisional headquarters staff escaped, but were captured a little further down the road at <a href="Bojnikovec">Bojnikovec</a>. The remnants of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment had to fight their way towards Bjelovar, but were attacked by German tanks on the outskirts, captured and detained. The 14th Panzer Division continued its almost completely unopposed drive on Zagreb using two routes, KriževciDugo SeloZagreb and BjelovarČazma<a href="Ivani%C4%87-Grad">Ivanić-Grad</a>Zagreb.

About 17:45 on 10 April, Kvaternik and SS-"<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>" <a href="Edmund%20Veesenmayer">Edmund Veesenmayer</a> went to the radio station in Zagreb and Kvaternik proclaimed the creation of the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (, NDH). The 35th Infantry Regiment of the 27th ID was disbanded by its commander when he heard news of the proclamation. By 19:30 on 10 April, lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb, having covered nearly in a single day. By the time it entered Zagreb, the 14th Panzer Division was met by cheering crowds, and had captured 15,000 Yugoslav troops, including 22 <a href="General%20officer">generals</a>.

About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held a conference in Zagreb, just as German tanks were entering the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that he could no longer hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the <a href="Kupa">Kupa</a> river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and <a href="Una%20%28Sava%29">Una</a> rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between <a href="Jasenovac%2C%20Sisak-Moslavina%20County">Jasenovac</a> and Zagreb.

The 40th ID was battered by German artillery fire during the night of 9/10 April. Seriously depleted by desertion and weakened by revolt, it was unable to mount the ordered counterattack against the Barcs bridgehead on the morning of 10 April. The 42nd Infantry Regiment could only muster 600 men, and the 86th Infantry Regiment slightly more. The divisional cavalry squadron was also heavily reduced in strength, and divisional artillery amounted to one anti-aircraft battery. The border units, responsible for demolition tasks on the line from Bjelovar south to <a href="%C4%8Cazma">Čazma</a>, refused to follow orders. Having abandoned the counterattack, Raketić decided to establish a defensive line at Pćelić to hinder German movement east towards Slatina.

Soon after dawn, the main thrust of the XXXXVI Motorised Corps, consisting of the 8th Panzer Division leading "Generalmajor" <a href="Sigfrid%20Henrici">Sigfrid Henrici</a>'s <a href="16th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">16th Motorised Infantry Division</a>, crossed the Drava at Barcs. Anti-tank fire destroyed a few of the lead tanks, but after the Germans reinforced their vanguard, the resistance of the 40th ID had been broken by noon. The remaining troops of the 42nd Infantry Regiment were either captured or fled into the hills to the south. Units of the 89th Infantry Regiment, which had been providing depth to the defensive position, began retreating south towards Slavonska Požega. "Ustaše" sympathisers and Yugoslav "<a href="Volksdeutsche">Volksdeutsche</a>" (ethnic German) troops either ran away or surrendered. By 13:30, the hard-pressed divisional cavalry squadron began to withdraw south towards Daruvar, attacking rebelling troops along their route. Raketić himself fled to <a href="Nova%20Gradi%C5%A1ka">Nova Gradiška</a> via <a href="Vo%C4%87in">Voćin</a> and Slavonska Požega, during which his car was again fired on by rebel troops. The 8th Panzer Division continued southeast between the Drava and Sava rivers, and meeting almost no further resistance, had reached Slatina by evening. Right flank elements of the 8th Panzer Division penetrated south into the Bilogora range, reaching <a href="Daruvar">Daruvar</a> and Voćin by evening.

Late in the day, as the situation was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, Simović, who was both the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Yugoslavia">Prime Minister</a> and <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff</a>, broadcast the following message:

The XXXXVI Motorised Corps encountered little resistance from the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th ID and 40th ID, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating, and all aircraft of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group had been destroyed. Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th ID due to suspicions that he was an "Ustaše" sympathiser, but could not identify a suitable replacement.

About 23:00, German 2nd Army headquarters directed the 14th Panzer Division to penetrate past Zagreb towards Karlovac to link up with the Italian 2nd Army, and also directed the 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division to drive to the north of Belgrade to link up with the <a href="1st%20Panzer%20Army">First Panzer Group</a> which was thrusting towards Belgrade from the east. At midnight, 2nd Army headquarters declared that the Yugoslav northern front had been decisively defeated, and tasked corps engineer units to consolidate bridging across major rivers, particularly over the Sava at <a href="Bre%C5%BEice">Brežice</a> west of Zagreb to facilitate the advance of the 14th Panzer Division towards Karlovac. The main body units of the XXXXVI Motorised Corps moved forward to Virovitica and Slatina, and 2nd Army headquarters moved forward to establish itself in Maribor, protected by the <a href="538th%20Frontier%20Guard%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">538th Frontier Guard Division</a>. At midnight, Vietinghoff issued orders for the 8th Panzer Division to continue towards Belgrade via <a href="Osijek">Osijek</a>, but directed the 16th Motorised Infantry Division to thrust west as far as <a href="Sremska%20Mitrovica">Sremska Mitrovica</a> then turn south to drive towards <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> via <a href="Zvornik">Zvornik</a>.

Held up by freezing weather and snow storms, LI Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and broke through a hastily established defensive line between <a href="Pregrada">Pregrada</a> and Krapina. Bicycle-mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division turned east to secure "Ustaše"-controlled Varaždin. The German-installed NDH government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division.

On 11 April, Petrović and the staff of 1st Army Group headquarters were captured by "Ustaše" at <a href="Petrinja">Petrinja</a>, and the rear area staff of 4th Army headquarters were captured by "Ustaše" at <a href="Topusko">Topusko</a>. The personnel of both headquarters were soon handed over to the Germans by their captors. Nedeljković and his operations staff escaped, and made their way to <a href="Prijedor">Prijedor</a>. Other units were retreating into Bosnia, including two battalions and 2–3 artillery batteries from the 40th ID. Nedeljković attempted to deploy rear area units of the 17th ID into a defensive line along the Una at <a href="Dubica%2C%20Bosnia-Herzegovina">Bosanska Dubica</a>, <a href="Kostajnica%2C%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosanska Kostajnica</a>, <a href="Novi%20Grad%2C%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosanski Novi</a>, <a href="Bosanska%20Krupa">Bosanska Krupa</a> and <a href="Biha%C4%87">Bihać</a>, and called Sarajevo to request reinforcements. With his remaining troops, Raketić attempted to establish a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and the mouth of the <a href="Vrbas%20%28river%29">Vrbas</a>. These efforts were significantly hampered by "Ustaše" propaganda.

The 42nd ID and Detachment "Ormozki" were cut off north of Zagreb, and those elements that did not disperse to their homes withdrew into the <a href="Ivan%C5%A1%C4%87ica">Ivanšćica</a> and <a href="Kalnik%20%28mountain%29">Kalnik</a> mountains. Leaders of a Slovene nationalist movement announced that they no longer recognised the Yugoslav government, and began to call for Slovene soldiers to cease fighting and return home, compounding the effect of "Ustaše" propaganda on Croat military personnel and accelerating the disintegration of Yugoslav forces.

Elements of the 14th Panzer Division thrust west from Zagreb into the rear of the withdrawing 7th Army and captured Karlovac on 11 April. The break-up of the 4th Army and westward thrust of the 14th Panzer Division opened up the Bosnian interior to the Germans, and also threatened the left flank of the Yugoslav forces attempting to establish a defensive line along the Sava. The German orders for the following day were to pursue the remnants of the Yugoslav Army through Bosnia towards Sarajevo, where they would be met by the First Panzer Group attacking from the south and east.

The 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division faced almost no resistance as they drove east towards Belgrade, capturing Našice, Osijek, Vinkovci and <a href="Vukovar">Vukovar</a> during the day. On the night of 11/12 April, they captured Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma, and secured a crossing over the Danube via an undamaged bridge near <a href="Bogojevo">Bogojevo</a>.

On 12 April, Nedeljković received orders direct from Simović that he was to defend the <a href="Bosanska%20Krajina">Bosanska Krajina</a> region by holding the Germans along the Sava and Una, using a new 4th Army formed from the remnants of the 4th and 7th Armies. By this time the 4th Army amounted to about 250–300 infantry and 12 artillery pieces, divided between Bosanska Kostajnica, Bosanski Novi, Bihać and Prijedor. To delay the German advance, he was ordered to destroy all the bridges on the Una before withdrawing to a line on the Vrbas.

The 14th Panzer Division swiftly captured Vrbosko, linking up with the Italians as they attacked down the Adriatic coast, thereby cutting off the remaining elements of the 7th Army. It was then ordered to split into three columns to pursue the Yugoslavs across Bosnia. The northern column headed for Doboj, the central column headed for Sarajevo, and the southern column drove towards <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a> in <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>.

About 18:00, Nedeljković received a telephone call from Simović and reported that Bosanska Dubica, Bosanski Novi and Prijedor had all fallen, but that the bridges on the Sava and Una would be demolished later that night, and that he and his remaining staff would be leaving at 20:00 for <a href="Jajce">Jajce</a>. By this time, Serb officers and soldiers were also deserting in significant numbers.

The following day, the northern column of the 14th Panzer Division drove via <a href="Glina%2C%20Croatia">Glina</a> and crossed the Una at both Bosanska Kostajnica and Bosanski Novi before continuing its push east. Elements of LI Infantry Corps also pushed east, establishing bridgeheads over the Kupa. A fragment of the 40th ID, numbering around 300 troops, which had been holding a position on the Sava at Bosanska Gradiška, retreated to Jajce via Banja Luka. When they arrived at Jajce, Nedeljković ordered them to take up blocking positions on the narrow Vrbas valley at <a href="Krupa%20na%20Vrbasu">Krupa</a> on the road between Banja Luka and <a href="Mrkonji%C4%87%20Grad">Mrkonjić Grad</a>. The rear area units of the 17th ID were ordered to block the road from <a href="Kotor%20Varo%C5%A1">Kotor Varoš</a> to Doboj.

In response to Nedeljković's request for reinforcements, Simović had sent several units by rail via <a href="Tuzla">Tuzla</a>. These included a cadet battalion and a company of the 27th Infantry Regiment, detached from the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20Cerska">1st Infantry Division "Cerska"</a>. By the time the reinforcements arrived, Banja Luka had been evacuated in the face of German tanks and an "Ustaše"-led revolt. The cadet battalion was redirected to <a href="Klju%C4%8D%2C%20Una-Sana%20Canton">Ključ</a> to block the road KljučMrkonjić GradJajce. Nedeljković did not have the option of withdrawing via <a href="Bugojno">Bugojno</a> or <a href="Prozor-Rama">Prozor</a> as those towns had been taken over by the "Ustaše".

On 14 April, under pressure from the 14th Panzer Division, remnants of the 4th Army continued to withdraw towards Sarajevo via Jajce and Travnik. The cadet battalion at Ključ managed to briefly delay the German advance through Mrkonjić Grad, but were overcome by tanks and air attacks. The bridge at Jajce was demolished at 23:15, and Nedeljković withdrew his headquarters to Travnik. The remaining units of the 4th Army continued to disintegrate. The vanguard of the northern column of 14th Panzer Division surged forward to <a href="Tesli%C4%87">Teslić</a>, the central column only reaching Jajce.

Early on 15 April, the northern column of the 14th Panzer Division closed on Doboj, and after overcoming resistance around that town, arrived in Sarajevo at 20:45. Before noon, Nedeljković received orders that a ceasefire had been agreed, and that all 4th Army troops were to remain in place and not fire on German personnel. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the Axis powers; Germany, Italy, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281939%E2%80%9343%29">Albania</a> all <a href="Annexation">annexed</a> parts of its territory. Almost all of the Croat members of the 4th Army taken as <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> were soon released by the Axis powers; 90 per cent of those held for the duration of the war were Serbs.

7th Army (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)

The 7th Army was a <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army</a> <a href="military%20organization">formation</a> raised prior to the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It consisted of two <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a>, two <a href="brigade">brigade</a>-strength mountain detachments, and a brigade-strength <a href="infantry">infantry</a> detachment. It formed part of the <a href="1st%20Army%20Group%20%28Yugoslavia%29">1st Army Group</a>, and was responsible for the defence of Yugoslavia's north-western frontier with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a> and Germany. Like all Yugoslav formations at the time, the 7th Army had serious deficiencies in both mobility and firepower.

Despite concerns over a possible Axis invasion, orders for the general mobilisation of the Royal Yugoslav Army were not issued by the government until 3 April 1941, out of fear this would offend <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and precipitate war. When the invasion commenced on 6 April, the 7th Army was only partially <a href="mobilisation">mobilised</a>, and on the first day the Germans seized several mountain passes and bridges over the <a href="Drava">Drava</a> river. <a href="Slovenes">Slovene</a> politicians formed a National Council of Slovenia with the intent of separating from Yugoslavia, and on the right flank of the 7th Army, the <a href="4th%20Army%20%28Yugoslavia%29">4th Army</a> was seriously weakened by <a href="Croat">Croat</a> <a href="fifth%20column">fifth column</a> activities within its major units and higher headquarters from the outset. This alarmed the 7th Army commander, "Divizijski đeneral" <a href="Du%C5%A1an%20Trifunovi%C4%87">Dušan Trifunović</a>, but he was not permitted to withdraw from the border areas until the night of 7/8 April, and this was followed by the German capture of <a href="Maribor">Maribor</a> on 8 April as they continued to expand their bridgeheads, supported by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>.

On 10 April, the German <a href="14th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">14th Panzer Division</a> captured <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>. Italian offensive operations began the following day, with thrusts towards <a href="Ljubljana">Ljubljana</a> and down the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> coast that resulted in the capture of more than 30,000 Yugoslav troops near <a href="Delnice">Delnice</a>. When fifth column supporters of the Croatian nationalist "<a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>" movement arrested the headquarters staff of the 7th Army later that day, the formation effectively ceased to exist. On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up with the Italians near the Adriatic coast, encircling the remnants of the 7th Army, which offered no further resistance. Ceasefires were implemented from 15 April, and the <a href="Supreme%20Command%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">Yugoslav Supreme Command</a> surrendered unconditionally effective on 18 April.

The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> was created with the merger of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro">Montenegro</a> and the <a href="South%20Slavs">South Slav</a>-inhabited areas of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> on 1 December 1918, in the immediate aftermath of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious <a href="Royal%20Serbian%20Army">Royal Serbian Army</a>, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, who saw it as a means by which to secure Serb political <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a>.

The army's development was hampered by the kingdom's poor economy, and this continued during the 1920s. In 1929, King <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Alexander</a> changed the name of the country to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, at which time the army was renamed the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army</a> (, VKJ). The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its <a href="military%20organisation">formations</a>. <a href="Infantry">Infantry</a> <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> had a wartime strength of 26,000–27,000 men, as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Generals better suited to the <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> of World War I were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist the fast-moving <a href="combined%20arms">combined arms</a> approach used by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germans</a> in their invasions of <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20France">France</a>.

The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within Yugoslavia, resulting from two decades of Serb hegemony and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the disunity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force. <a href="Fifth%20column">Fifth column</a> activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist "<a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>" but also from the country's <a href="Slovenes">Slovene</a> and <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">ethnic German</a> minorities.

Yugoslav war plans foresaw the headquarters of the 7th Army and its <a href="field%20army">army</a>-level supporting units being created at the time of <a href="mobilisation">mobilisation</a>. Unlike the other six Yugoslav armies, the 7th Army did not have a corresponding army district during peacetime, and would be allocated divisions when it was formed. <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, <a href="Karlovac">Karlovac</a>, <a href="Trebnje">Trebnje</a> and <a href="Velike%20La%C5%A1%C4%8De">Velike Lašče</a> were key centres for the mobilisation and concentration of the 7th Army due to their good rail infrastructure.

Prior to the invasion, significant fortifications known as the <a href="Rupnik%20Line">Rupnik Line</a> were constructed along the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> and German borders, within what became the 7th Army's area of operations. Along the frontier with Italy, mutually supporting bunkers were established on forward slopes of the mountain ranges behind a belt of obstacles. The main positions followed a line from <a href="Blego%C5%A1">Mount Blegoš</a> south-south-east through <a href="Hlav%C4%8De%20Njive">Hlavče Njive</a>, <a href="%C5%BDirovski%20Vrh%2C%20%C5%BDiri">Žirovski Vrh</a>, <a href="Vrh%20Svetih%20Treh%20Kraljev">Vrh Svetih Treh Kraljev</a>, <a href="Zaplana%2C%20Vrhnika">Zaplana</a>, <a href="Slivnica%20%28mountain%29">Mount Slivnica</a>, <a href="Grahovo%2C%20Cerknica">Grahovo</a>, and <a href="Stari%20Trg%20pri%20Lo%C5%BEu">Lož</a> to Petičak. To the north of Mount Blegoš, positions ran behind the lines of the <a href="Sora%20%28river%29">Selška Sora</a> and <a href="Sava%20Bohinjka">Sava Bohinjka</a> rivers. Fortifications were also established in the mountainous <a href="Gorski%20kotar">Gorski kotar</a> region between Karlovac and <a href="Rijeka">Fiume</a> on the upper <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> coast. Along the German border, the Yugoslavs concentrated on preparing to block the passes through the <a href="Karawanks">Karawank</a> and <a href="Kamnik%E2%80%93Savinja%20Alps">Kamnik</a> Alps, and built bunkers behind obstacles along the routes leading south from the border towards <a href="Dravograd">Dravograd</a>, <a href="Maribor">Maribor</a> and <a href="Ptuj">Ptuj</a>. Preparations were also made to block routes north of the <a href="Drava">Drava</a> and along the southern banks of the <a href="Mur%20%28river%29">Mura</a> and Drava. These fortifications were to be manned by border guard units, and were not the responsibility of the 7th Army.
The 7th Army was commanded by "Divizijski đeneral" <a href="Du%C5%A1an%20Trifunovi%C4%87">Dušan Trifunović</a>, and his <a href="Chief%20of%20staff%23Military">chief of staff</a> was "Pukovnik" Vladimir Petrović. The 7th Army consisted of:

Army-level support was provided by the 71st Army Artillery Regiment, the 7th <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">Anti-Aircraft</a> Battalion, and the motorised 7th Army Anti-Aircraft <a href="company%20%28military%29">Company</a>. The 6th Air Reconnaissance Group comprising sixteen <a href="Breguet%2019">Breguet 19</a>s was attached from the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force</a> (, VVKJ) and was based at <a href="Cerklje%20ob%20Krki%20Airport">Cerklje</a> and <a href="Brege">Brege</a> near <a href="Bre%C5%BEice">Brežice</a>.

The 7th Army was part of the <a href="1st%20Army%20Group%20%28Yugoslavia%29">1st Army Group</a>, which was responsible for the defence of north and north-western Yugoslavia, with the 7th Army along the Italian and German borders, and the <a href="4th%20Army%20%28Yugoslavia%29">4th Army</a> defending the eastern sector along the Hungarian border. The <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">1st Cavalry Division</a> was to be held as the 1st Army Group reserve around Zagreb. On the left of the 7th Army was the Adriatic coast at <a href="Karlobag">Karlobag</a>, and the boundary with the 4th Army on the right flank ran from <a href="Gornja%20Radgona">Gornja Radgona</a> on the <a href="Mur%20river">Mura</a> through <a href="Krapina">Krapina</a> and Karlovac to <a href="Oto%C4%8Dac">Otočac</a>. The Yugoslav defence plan saw the 7th Army deployed in a cordon along the border region from the Adriatic in the west to Gornja Radgona in the east. Of the formations of the 7th Army, the mobilisation of the three detachments was largely complete, but the two divisions had only commenced mobilisation. All 7th Army formations were to be deployed in a cordon, although each formation was to create a second line of defence from its own troops. The headquarters of the 7th Army was to initially be located in Brežice. The planned deployment of the 7th Army from west to east was:

Army-level and rear area troops were to be deployed in the area of Brežice, <a href="Zidani%20Most">Zidani Most</a> and <a href="Novo%20Mesto">Novo Mesto</a>. Border guard units were to man fortifications along the Italian and German frontiers in the 7th Army area of responsibility, and consisted of:


After unrelenting pressure from <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, Yugoslavia signed the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a> on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, a military <a href="Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under the VVKJ commander, "Armijski đeneral" <a href="Du%C5%A1an%20Simovi%C4%87">Dušan Simović</a>. A general mobilisation was not called by the new government until 3 April, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. On the same day as the coup, Hitler issued <a href="F%C3%BChrer%20Directives">Führer Directive</a> 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the invasion, which was to commence on 6 April.

According to a post-war <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> study, by the time the invasion began, the three brigade-sized detachments had mobilised, but the 32nd Infantry Division "Triglavski" and 38th Infantry Division "Dravska" had only commenced mobilising. The Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić describes the mobilisation of the 7th Army as a whole on 6 April as "only partial", and states the headquarters of the 7th Army was mobilising in the Zagreb region.

Detachment "Lika" was an "ad hoc" formation consisting of the 44th Infantry Regiment and one battery of the 17th Artillery Regiment. On 6 April, it was concentrating in the Otočac region, but the poor response of personnel of the 44th Infantry Regiment to the mobilisation orders meant that it was only at 35–40 percent of its strength.

Mountain Detachment "Rišnajaski" was commanded by "Pukovnik" Stojadin Milenković. On 6 April, the detachment, consisting of a headquarters, the 2nd Mountain Regiment of three battalions, the 5th Mountain Artillery Battery and supporting units, was deployed between various towns and villages in the areas of <a href="%C4%8Cabar">Čabar</a>, Delnice, Gornje Jelenje, Kamenjak and <a href="Lokve%2C%20Croatia">Lokve</a>, as follows:

A significant part of the 32nd Infantry Division "Triglavski" was moving from its mobilisation areas to its concentration areas, while some elements were still mobilising. On 6 April, the division was located as follows:

Mountain Detachment "Triglavski" was commanded by "Brigadni đeneral" Mihailo Lukić. It consisted of the 1st Mountain Infantry Regiment of three battalions, supported by one battery of mountain artillery and other units. About 80 percent of the formation had answered the mobilisation order, and it was deployed in the vicinity of the towns of <a href="Municipality%20of%20Jezersko">Jezersko</a>, <a href="Tr%C5%BEi%C4%8D">Tržič</a>, <a href="Radovljica">Radovljica</a>, <a href="%C5%A0kofja%20Loka">Škofja Loka</a> and <a href="Kranj">Kranj</a>.

The 38th Infantry Division "Dravska" had only commenced mobilisation, and was largely in its mobilisation centres or moving to concentration areas. On 6 April, the elements of the division were located as follows:

At the time of the invasion, both mountain detachments had completed mobilisation and concentration, and were in position. Detachment "Lika" was at its mobilisation centre, but the turn-out of men for its infantry component was low. The 38th Infantry Division "Dravska" was completing its concentration. A large proportion of the 32nd Infantry Division "Triglavski" was moving from its mobilisation centres to its concentration areas. Across the 7th Army, around 80 percent of troops had answered the mobilisation order, but only 45 to 50 percent of vehicles and animals were available.

The border between Italy, Germany and Yugoslavia was largely unsuitable for motorised operations due to the mountainous terrain. Due to the short notice of the invasion, the elements of the invading German <a href="2nd%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">2nd Army</a> that would make up <a href="LI%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">LI Infantry Corps</a> and <a href="XXXXIX%20Mountain%20Corps%20%28Wehrmacht%29">XXXXIX Mountain Corps</a> had to be transported from Germany, <a href="German-occupied%20France">German-occupied France</a> and the <a href="puppet%20state">Nazi puppet</a> <a href="Slovak%20Republic%20%281939%E2%80%9345%29">Slovak Republic</a>, and nearly all encountered difficulties in reaching their assembly areas in time. In the interim, the Germans formed a special force under the code name "Feuerzauber" (Magic Fire). This force was initially intended to merely reinforce the <a href="538th%20Frontier%20Guard%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">538th Frontier Guard Division</a>, who were manning the border. On the evening of 5 April, a particularly aggressive "Feuerzauber" detachment commander, "<a href="Hauptmann">Hauptmann</a>" Palten, led his "<a href="Kampfgruppe">Kampfgruppe</a> Palten" across the Mura from <a href="Spielfeld">Spielfeld</a> and, having secured the bridge, began attacking bunkers and other Yugoslav positions on the high ground, and sent patrols deep into the Yugoslav border fortification system. Due to a lack of Yugoslav <a href="counter-attack">counter-attack</a>s, many of these positions remained in German hands into 6 April.

On the morning of 6 April, German aircraft conducted surprise attacks on Yugoslav airfields in the 7th Army area, including Ljubljana and Cerklje, where the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group was based. At 07:00, <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>E fighters of <a href="Jagdgeschwader%2027">"Jagdgeschwader" 27</a> strafed Ljubljana airfield, attacking hangars and some <a href="Potez%2025">Potez 25</a> biplanes.

LI Infantry Corps, commanded by "<a href="General%20of%20the%20Infantry%20%28Germany%29">General der Infanterie</a>" <a href="Hans-Wolfgang%20Reinhard">Hans-Wolfgang Reinhard</a>, were tasked with attacking towards Maribor then driving towards Zagreb, while the XXXXIX Mountain Corps, under "General der Infanterie" <a href="Ludwig%20K%C3%BCbler">Ludwig Kübler</a>, was to capture Dravograd then force a crossing on the <a href="Sava">Sava</a>. At 05:00 on 6 April, LI Infantry Corps captured the Mura bridges at <a href="Mureck">Mureck</a> and <a href="Bad%20Radkersburg">Radkersburg</a> (opposite Gornja Radgona) undamaged. In the sector of the 38th Infantry Division "Dravska", one German column pushed towards Maribor from Mureck, and the other pushed on from Gornja Radgona through <a href="Municipality%20of%20Lenart">Lenart</a> towards Ptuj. Some time later, other elements of LI Infantry Corps attacked the area between <a href="Sveti%20Duh%2C%20Dravograd">Sveti Duh</a> and Dravograd. The 7th and 8th Border Regiments met these attacks with fierce resistance, but were forced to withdraw due to German pressure. The <a href="183rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">183rd Infantry Division</a>, under "<a href="Generalmajor">Generalmajor</a>" <a href="Benignus%20Dippold">Benignus Dippold</a>, captured 300 prisoners, and a bicycle-mounted detachment of the division reached <a href="Murska%20Sobota">Murska Sobota</a> without striking any resistance. The <a href="132nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">132nd Infantry Division</a>, commanded by "Generalmajor" <a href="Rudolf%20Sintzenich">Rudolf Sintzenich</a>, also pushed south along the Sejanski valley towards <a href="Savci">Savci</a>. By the end of the first day, LI Infantry Corps had occupied Gornja Radgona, Murska Sobota and <a href="Radenci">Radenci</a>, and had crossed the Drava near Sveti Duh. XXXXIX Mountain Corps captured border crossings on the approaches to Dravograd, but were held up by the 6th Border Regiment in mountain passes located further west at <a href="Loibl%20Pass">Ljubelj</a>, <a href="Seeberg%20Saddle">Jezerski vrh</a> and <a href="Wurzen%20Pass">Korensko sedlo</a>. Late that day, mountain <a href="Pioneer%20%28military%29">pioneers</a> destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in the area penetrated by "Kampfgruppe Palten".

Later that day, German <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> "Stuka" <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s of <a href="Sturzkampfgeschwader%2077">Sturzkampfgeschwader 77</a>, escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters, caught the Breguet 19s of the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group on the ground at Cerklje and Brege, destroying most of them. This was followed by attacks by the <a href="Regia%20Aeronautica">Italian Air Force</a> on Yugoslav troop concentrations of the 7th Army. The Yugoslav Air Force was unable to interdict the Axis air attacks because the <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s and <a href="Ikarus%20IK-2">Ikarus IK-2</a> aircraft of its 4th Fighter Regiment were based away at <a href="Lakta%C5%A1i">Bosanski Aleksandrovac</a>. After having been grounded for most of the day by poor weather, in the afternoon <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> Mk I <a href="light%20bomber">light bomber</a>s of the Yugoslav 68th Bomber Group flew missions against airfields and railway stations across the German frontier at <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, <a href="F%C3%BCrstenfeld">Fürstenfeld</a>, <a href="Steyr">Steyr</a> and <a href="Wiener%20Neustadt">Wiener Neustadt</a>.

By the close of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the fighting was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division "Dravska" was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at <a href="Slovenj%20Gradec">Slovenj Gradec</a> and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.

On that day, <a href="Marko%20Natla%C4%8Den">Marko Natlačen</a>—the governor of the <a href="Drava%20Banovina">Drava Banovina</a>—met with representatives of the major Slovene political parties, and created the National Council of Slovenia (, NszS), whose aim was to establish a Slovenia independent of Yugoslavia. When he heard the news of fifth-column-led revolts within the 4th Army, Trifunović was alarmed, and proposed withdrawal from the border areas, but this was rejected by the commander of the 1st Army Group, "Armijski đeneral" <a href="Milorad%20Petrovi%C4%87">Milorad Petrović</a>. The front along the border with Italy was relatively quiet, with some patrol clashes occurring, some sporadic artillery bombardments of border fortifications, and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians directed at Mount Blegoš.

In the early hours of 7 April, three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment took off from <a href="Rovine%2C%20Gradi%C5%A1ka">Rovine</a> to bomb the railway junction at <a href="Feldbach%2C%20Styria">Feldbach</a>, but became disoriented in bad weather. Only one aircraft found a target in Austria, bombing a bridge and road near Steyr before continuing on to Wiener Neustadt where it was hit by anti-aircraft fire and made an emergency landing.

Over the period 7–9 April, LI Infantry Corps held the lead elements of its two divisions back to some extent while the rest of each division de-trained in Graz and made their way to the border. German forces along the front of the 7th Army continued to push towards Ptuj, Maribor and Dravograd on 7 April, against significant resistance from the 6th, 7th and 8th Border Regiments. The German thrusts towards Ptuj and Maribor broke through the Yugoslav defensive line <a href="Municipality%20of%20Pesnica">Pesnica</a>–Lenart–<a href="Sveta%20Trojica%20v%20Slovenskih%20Goricah">Sveta Trojica v Slovenskih Goricah</a>–<a href="Kapelski%20Vrh">Kapelski Vrh</a>, but those advancing towards Dravograd were held up by the 6th Border Regiment and a battalion of the 38th Infantry Division "Dravska". Along the Italian border there were only skirmishes caused by Italian reconnaissance-in-force to a depth of .

The <a href="Supreme%20Command%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">Yugoslav Supreme Command</a> ordered Petrović to use Mountain Detachment "Rišnajaski" to capture Fiume, across the <a href="Rje%C4%8Dina">Rječina</a> river from Sušak, but the order was soon rescinded due to the deteriorating situation in the flanking 4th Army. In the afternoon of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted that this might become necessary if the situation on the immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the chief of staff of the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, "Armijski đeneral" <a href="Leon%20Rupnik">Leon Rupnik</a>, who suggested that Trifunović should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.

On the night of 7/8 April, Petrović ordered Trifunović to begin to withdraw, first to a line through the <a href="Dravinja">Dravinja</a> river, Zidani Most bridge and the right bank of the <a href="Krka%20%28Sava%29">Krka</a> river. Later in the day this was moved back to the line of the <a href="Kupa">Kupa</a> river. This ended the successful defence of the 38th Infantry Division "Dravska" along the line of the Drava, and meant their withdrawal from Maribor. Disregarding orders from above, Palten exploited their withdrawal by leading his "kampfgruppe" south towards the town, and crossing the <a href="Pesnica%20%28river%29">Pesnica river</a> in <a href="inflatable%20boat%23World%20War%20II">inflatable boats</a>, leaving his unit vehicles behind. In the evening, Palten and his force entered Maribor unopposed, taking 100 prisoners. For disregarding orders, Palten and his "kampfgruppe" were ordered to return to Spielfeld, and spent the rest of the invasion guarding the border. In the meantime, the forward elements of the two divisions consolidated their bridgeheads, with the 132nd Infantry Division securing Maribor, and the 183rd Infantry Division pushing past Murska Sobota, reaching Kapelski Vrh.

Some bridges over the Sava were blown before all elements of the 7th and 8th Border Regiments had withdrawn, but some soldiers were able to swim across, the rest being captured by the advancing Germans. German patrols reached the Drava at Ptuj, and further east at <a href="Ormo%C5%BE">Ormož</a> they found the bridge had been blown. Elements of the XXXXIX Mountain Corps had pushed forward to <a href="Poljana%2C%20Prevalje">Poljana</a> and Dravograd. The German troops received close air support from dive bombers and fighters during their advance, while <a href="medium%20bomber">medium bomber</a>s hit targets throughout the 7th Army area. The 4th Fighter Regiment clashed several times with German aircraft on 8 April without result. Three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment again flew a mission to attack a target in southern Austria, escorted by 4th Fighter Regiment Hurricanes, but the rest of the 8th Bomber Regiment was awaiting orders to bomb a rebelling Yugoslav regiment of the neighbouring 4th Army in <a href="Bjelovar">Bjelovar</a>; the orders were subsequently cancelled. During the day, the Italian <a href="3rd%20Alpine%20Group">3rd Alpine Group</a> captured <a href="Kranjska%20Gora">Kranjska Gora</a> at the headwaters of the Sava in the sector of Mountain Detachment "Triglavski". The German orders for the following day were for LI Infantry Corps to force a crossing of the Drava near Varazdin and advance on Zagreb, while XXXXIX Mountain Corps were to drive towards Celje.

On 9 April, the Germans continued their advance, and all elements of both divisions of LI Infantry Corps had finally unloaded in Graz. In view of German success, the Italian <a href="Second%20Army%20%28Italy%29">2nd Army</a> in north-eastern Italy accelerated its preparations and issued orders for its <a href="V%20Corps%20%28Italy%29">V</a> and <a href="XI%20Corps%20%28Italy%29">XI Corps</a> to conduct preliminary operations aimed at improving their starting positions for the planned attack on Yugoslavia. In the meantime, the 7th Army continued rapidly withdrawing its right wing, while withdrawing its centre and keeping the Mountain Detachment "Rišnajaski" in place on its left flank. The 38th Infantry Division "Dravska" continued to withdraw south from Ptuj through Krapina towards Zagreb, while the 32nd Infantry Division "Triglavski" and Mountain Detachment "Triglavski" fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river. Units of LI Infantry Corps crossed the Drava along the line Maribor—Ptuj and further east, and continued to expand their bridgehead south of Maribor. Elements of XXXXIX Mountain Corps secured the southern exit of the <a href="Karawanks%20Tunnel%20%28railway%29">Karawanks railway tunnel</a> near <a href="Jesenice%2C%20Jesenice">Jesenice</a> and expanded their bridgehead at Dravograd. Italian units made several weak attacks on the sector of the 32nd Infantry Division "Triglavski" and against Mountain Detachment "Rišnajaski", and Detachment "Lika" took up positions on the coast. On the same day, the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group airfield at Cerklje was again attacked by German aircraft.

As the activities of Natlačen and his NszS were continuing, the Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered their arrest. Rupnik and the head of the operations staff of the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, "Pukovnik" Franjo Nikolić, hid the orders from Petrović and did not carry them out.

On the evening of 9 April, the commander of the German 2nd Army, "<a href="Generaloberst">Generaloberst</a>" <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Weichs">Maximilian von Weichs</a>, ordered the <a href="XXXXVI%20Panzer%20Corps">XXXXVI Motorised Corps</a> to break out of its bridgeheads in the 4th Army's sector the following day. The thrust from the Zákány bridgehead was to drive straight west to Zagreb then continue west to cut off the withdrawing 7th Army. This attack was led by the 14th Panzer Division, supported by dive bombers, and was a resounding success. By 19:30 on 10 April, lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb, having covered nearly in a single day. Before it arrived, the "Ustaše", supported by German agents, had proclaimed the creation of the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (, NDH). By the time it entered Zagreb, the 14th Panzer Division was met by cheering crowds, and had captured 15,000 Yugoslav troops, including 22 <a href="General%20officer">generals</a>.

In the 7th Army sector, about 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began crossing the Drava, but construction of a bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point, and established a bridgehead. This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment "Ormozki", the far left formation of the 4th Army. This crossing, combined with the withdrawal of the 38th Infantry Division "Dravska" from the line from <a href="Slovenska%20Bistrica">Slovenska Bistrica</a> to Ptuj, exposed the left flank of Detachment "Ormozki". The Detachment attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night of 10/11 April.

That same night, the <a href="1st%20Mountain%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">1st Mountain Division</a>, the most capable formation of XXXXIX Mountain Corps, had de-trained, crossed the border near <a href="Bleiburg">Bleiburg</a>, and advanced southeast towards <a href="Celje">Celje</a>, reaching a point about from the town by evening. The rest of the XXXXIX Mountain Corps encountered little resistance, and by nightfall had reached the line <a href="%C5%A0o%C5%A1tanj">Šoštanj</a>–<a href="Mislinja%20%28settlement%29">Mislinja</a>. Luftwaffe reconnaissance sorties revealed that the main body of the 7th Army was withdrawing towards Zagreb, leaving behind light forces to maintain contact with the German bridgeheads. When it received this information, 2nd Army headquarters ordered LI Infantry Corps to form motorised columns to pursue the 7th Army south, but extreme weather conditions and flooding of the Drava at Maribor on 10 April slowed the German pursuit.

On 10 April, as the situation was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, Simović, who was both the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Yugoslavia">Prime Minister</a> and <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>, broadcast the following message:

All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every means at their disposal. Don't wait for direct orders from above, but act on your own and be guided by your judgement, initiative, and conscience.

During the night of 10/11 April, XXXXIX Mountain Corps was ordered to bridge the <a href="Savinja">Savinja</a> river at Celje, then advance towards Brežice on the Sava, and LI Infantry Corps was directed to link up with the 14th Panzer Division which would then drive west to Karlovac. The Italians were expected to commence offensive action by attacking southwards to link up with the 14th Panzer Division in the vicinity of Karlovac.

On 11 April, "Ustaše" elements captured the staff of the 7th Army at <a href="Topusko">Topusko</a> and handed them over to the Germans shortly thereafter, and the 7th Army effectively ceased to exist as a formation. Petrović and the staff of 1st Army Group headquarters were also captured by "Ustaše" at Petrinja. Chaos ensued throughout the 7th Army, whose Croat and Slovene soldiers could hear fifth column radio broadcasts telling them of their pending encirclement by the Germans and encouraging them to return to their homes and not fight against the invaders. This was reinforced by Natlačen and his NszS, who had distributed leaflets on the night of 10/11 April urging soldiers not to resist the Italians or Germans. To maintain public order, the NszS also formed a "Slovenian Legion" on 11 April, and encouraged Slovene nationalists among the 7th Army to join it. This force, split into a dozen units and totalling 2,000–3,000 men, then began to assist the Germans in disarming units of the Yugoslav Army on Slovene territory. The NszS authorised Natlačen to negotiate with the Germans for the creation of a Slovene client state along the lines of the NDH and the Slovak Republic, and Natlačen appointed the Ljubljana police chief <a href="Lovro%20Hacin">Lovro Hacin</a> to make contact with the Germans.
Proxies for the NszS approached "Generalmajor" <a href="Hubert%20Lanz">Hubert Lanz</a>, the commander of the 1st Mountain Division, when his formation approached Celje, but Lanz was not empowered to negotiate with civilians, and sought direction from higher headquarters. All German commanders were authorised to negotiate with the commanders of Yugoslav military formations so long as they agreed to surrender all weapons. Later that day, Lanz was authorised to meet with Natlačen the following day, and XXXXIX Mountain Corps took Celje. Held up by freezing weather and snow storms, LI Infantry Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and broke through a hastily established defensive line between <a href="Pregrada">Pregrada</a> and Krapina. Bicycle-mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division turned east to secure "Ustaše"-controlled Varaždin. In the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division but lead elements of that division had already thrust west from Zagreb into the rear of the withdrawing 7th Army and captured Karlovac.

Around 12:00, the Italians went over to the offensive, with the 3rd Alpine Group tasked to advance to the line <a href="Selca%2C%20%C5%BDelezniki">Selca</a>–Radovljica, XI Corps to push via <a href="Logatec">Logatec</a> to Ljubljana, VI Corps to drive on <a href="Prezid%2C%20Vrhnika">Prezid</a>, and V Corps to advance from Fiume towards <a href="Kraljevica">Kraljevica</a> then Lokve. While one Italian attack south of the <a href="Sne%C5%BEnik%20%28plateau%29">Snežnik plateau</a> was stopped by elements of the Mountain Detachment "Rišnajaski" and the Italian advance was held up by border troops in some areas, there was little significant resistance, and by the end of the day they had captured <a href="Su%C5%A1ak%2C%20Rijeka">Sušak</a>, <a href="Bakar">Bakar</a>, <a href="Delnice">Delnice</a>, Jesenice, <a href="Vrhnika">Vrhnika</a>, Logatec and Ljubljana. To assist the Italian advance, the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the Ljubljana region, and the <a href="14th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">14th Panzer Division</a>, which had captured Zagreb on 10 April, drove west to <a href="encirclement">encircle</a> the withdrawing 7th Army. The Italians faced little resistance, and captured about 30,000 troops of the 7th Army waiting to surrender near Delnice. When the Italian <a href="14th%20Infantry%20Division%20Isonzo">14th Infantry Division "Isonzo"</a> entered Ljubljana, a delegate of the NszS greeted its commander, "Generale di Divisione" <a href="Federico%20Romero">Federico Romero</a>, and symbolically handed him the keys to the city. An official reception was held for Romero that evening, attended by Natlačen and most of the members of the NszS, but because Natlačen and the council preferred that the Germans occupy Ljubljana, he asked Romero for permission to travel to Celje the following day to meet with Lanz.

On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up with the Italians at <a href="Vrbovsko">Vrbovsko</a>, closing the ring around the remnants of the 7th Army, which surrendered, and the 1st Mountain Division pushed through Novo Mesto and <a href="%C4%8Crnomelj">Črnomelj</a> without facing resistance, reaching <a href="Vinice">Vinice</a> by the end of the day. At Celje, Lanz received a delegation led by Natlačen which included <a href="Andrej%20Gosar">Andrej Gosar</a>. The meeting was very formal and cold, as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break-up of Slovenia into Italian and German-controlled territories, and the council and its goal of an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective.

Remnants of the 4th Army conducted a fighting withdrawal through <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> towards <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> over the following days, pursued by the 14th Panzer Division and elements of LI Infantry Corps but a ceasefire was declared at noon on 15 April. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the Axis powers, with Germany, Italy, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281939%E2%80%9343%29">Albania</a> all <a href="Annexation">annexing</a> parts of its territory. Most of the Slovene members of the 7th Army taken as <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> were soon released by the Axis powers, as 90 per cent of those held for the duration of the war were Serbs.

A Cure for Pokeritis

A Cure for Pokeritis is a 1912 <a href="short%20film">short</a> <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> starring <a href="John%20Bunny">John Bunny</a> and <a href="Flora%20Finch">Flora Finch</a>. After Bunny's death in 1915, a re-release was announced with the alternative title A Sure Cure for Pokeritis. The film, a domestic comedy, depicts a woman who stops her husband's gambling habit by having her cousin stage a fake police raid on his weekly poker game. It was one of many similar shorts produced by <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a>—one-reel comedies starring Bunny and Finch in a domestic setting, known popularly as "Bunnygraphs" or "Bunnyfinches"—whose popularity made Bunny and Finch early <a href="film%20star">film star</a>s. The film has been recognized as an historically important representative of its period and genre.

Upon returning home from an evening spent losing at <a href="poker">poker</a>, George Brown swears off <a href="gambling">gambling</a> forever. However, his friend Bigelow convinces him to secretly continue attending the weekly poker game and to tell his wife Mary that he has been admitted to the Sons of the Morning, a <a href="fraternity">fraternal lodge</a>, to explain his absences. When George <a href="somniloquy">sleep-talks</a>, she becomes suspicious and has her cousin Freddie Dewdrop follow him, allowing her to learn the truth. Together with the wives of the other poker players, she enacts a plan to end the gambling. Freddie and the members of his <a href="Bible%20study%20group">Bible study group</a> dress up as police officers and raid the game. The gamblers' wives then arrive, and the "police" leave the men to be scolded, purportedly in place of being arrested. As the film ends, the Browns reconcile.

It is not entirely clear what the names of the characters played by Bunny and Finch were intended to be. In the film, the letter written to gather the wives together identifies the two main characters as Mary and George Brown. However, a <a href="cast%20list">cast list</a> in Vitagraph's <a href="house%20organ">in-house publication</a> refers to the main characters as Mr. and Mrs. Bunny Sharpe, while "Mr. Brown" is given as the name of a minor character.


"A Cure for Pokeritis" was one of many <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph</a>'s <a href="short%20film">one-reel</a> or shorter comedies starring Bunny and Finch in a domestic setting, known popularly as "Bunnygraphs" or "Bunnyfinches". The number of these shorts that were originally produced is unknown because Vitagraph's films were generally not archived. Estimates vary considerably; totals in excess of 150, 200, or 260 have been proposed. Most of the studio's films are now <a href="lost%20film">considered lost</a>.

The film was an early example of efforts to move beyond theater <a href="Blocking%20%28stage%29">blocking</a> conventions. During the police raid, depth was demonstrated by having action take place in both the foreground and the background, and by allowing actors to move between the spaces. This <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a> technique lent realism to the scene, and improved its pacing.

In the <a href="Silent%20film">silent era</a>, movies were accompanied by a variety of live and recorded music. Depending on the film and the venue, the music might have been the performance of a live pianist or orchestra, recorded music, or absent entirely. Some pictures were distributed with <a href="cue%20%28theatrical%29">cue sheets</a> indicating when music was to be played, or anthologies of specific songs to use as accompaniment. Especially between 1910 and 1912, these selections were often <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a>, chosen because the song's title or lyrics related to the film in some way, in contrast to later efforts to provide music with appropriate <a href="texture%20%28music%29">texture</a>. Beginning in 1910, Vitagraph provided lists of this nature for all of their films.

Vitagraph's recommended music for "A Cure for Pokeritis" began with "I'm Glad I'm Married" and "I've Got My Eyes on You". The studio suggested either "I Don't Believe You" or "I'm an Honorary Member of the Patsy Club" be played as George presented his purported lodge membership. His sleep-talking was to be accompanied by "If You Talk in Your Sleep, Don't Mention My Name", followed by "Back to the Factory, Mary" as Freddie investigates. "Whoops, My Dear" was to score the police raid, and "Don't Take Me Home" would play as the film ended.

The Bunnygraphs, as a genre, were representative of the cinema of the period, and were very successful, making Bunny the first American comic film star and Finch the first female star comedian. "A Cure for Pokeritis", released February 23, 1912, was individually well-received, including in showings outside the United States. The "Thames Star", a New Zealand newspaper, described the film as "screamingly funny". After John Bunny's death, interest in his films led Vitagraph in 1917 to announce the re-release of this film (retitled "A Sure Cure for Pokeritis"), along with many of his other works, as "Favorite Film Features". However, the comedy style of "A Cure for Pokeritis" has not aged well, especially in contrast to <a href="Mack%20Sennett">Mack Sennett</a>'s <a href="slapstick">slapstick</a> films and the works of later comedians such as <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> and <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a>. According to film scholars Donald McCaffrey and Christopher Jacobs, modern viewers "will hardly get a flicker of a smile" from the film, despite the skill of its actors.
The film's themes and its relationship to later works have been the subject of critical analysis. "A Cure for Pokeritis" may be the first depiction of poker in film, and provides insight into the public's perception of the game at the time as a male-dominated societal ill. This attitude, and a scene similar to the film's plot, is also present in <a href="Cassius%20Marcellus%20Coolidge">Cassius Marcellus Coolidge</a>'s painting "Sitting up with a Sick Friend", part of the "<a href="Dogs%20Playing%20Poker">Dogs Playing Poker</a>" series commissioned in 1903. "A Cure for Pokeritis" has been compared to <a href="sitcoms">sitcoms</a> of both the 1940s and the end of the 20th century. Film historian Wes Gehring of <a href="Ball%20State%20University">Ball State University</a> considers George to be a forerunner of the modern <a href="antihero">antihero</a> archetype and compares the Browns to <a href="Laurel%20and%20Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>. Other authors have examined the film's gender issues. <a href="Gerald%20Mast">Gerald Mast</a> wrote that the comedic aspects overlaid a conflict between <a href="masculinity">masculinity</a> and <a href="morality">moralist</a> or <a href="feminism">feminist</a> values. <a href="Brunel%20University">Brunel University</a> lecturer Geoff King viewed the male lead's efforts to escape from an "imprisoning" wife to be a recurring theme in silent comedy, and film reviewer Peter Nash found the "fastidious and effeminate" Freddie an example of a contemporary gay stock character.

In 2011, this film was selected for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> as being a "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" representative of the Bunnygraph films.

"A Cure for Pokeritis" is in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a> and so is widely available, including online. In 1998, <a href="Kino%20International%20%28company%29">Kino International</a> included it in "Slapstick Encyclopedia", an eight-volume <a href="VHS">VHS</a> collection of silent films that was re-released in 2002 as a five-disc <a href="DVD">DVD</a> collection by <a href="Image%20Entertainment">Image Entertainment</a>.

Virgin and Child Enthroned

The Virgin and Child Enthroned (also known as the Thyssen Madonna) is a small oil-on-oak <a href="panel%20painting">panel painting</a> dated 1433, usually attributed to the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> artist <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. It is closely related to his "<a href="Madonna%20Standing%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Madonna Standing</a>", completed during the same period. The panel is filled with Christian <a href="iconography">iconography</a>, including representations of <a href="Prophets%20of%20Christianity">prophets</a>, the <a href="Annunciation%20to%20Mary">Annunciation</a>, <a href="Christ%20Child">Christ's infancy</a> and <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a>, and <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary's</a> <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20Virgin">Coronation</a>. It is generally accepted as the earliest extant work by van der Weyden, one of three works attributed to him of the <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Virgin and Child</a> enclosed in a <a href="niche%20%28architecture%29">niche</a> on an exterior wall of a <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> church. The panel is housed in the <a href="Museo%20Thyssen-Bornemisza">Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza</a> in Madrid.

The panel seems to be the left-hand wing of a dismantled <a href="diptych">diptych</a>, perhaps with the "Saint George and the Dragon" panel now in the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a>, Washington, D.C. As an early van der Weyden, it takes influence from <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a> and <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>. Van der Weyden served his apprenticeship under Campin, and the older master's style is noticeable in the architecture of the niche, the Virgin's facial type, her exposed breast and the treatment of her hair.

The panel is the smallest extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a "<a href="Nursing%20Madonna">Madonna Lactans</a>", with significant differences. Christ is dressed in a red garment, as opposed to the <a href="swaddling">swaddling</a> he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>'s "Madonna" in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as <a href="Queen%20of%20Heaven">Queen of Heaven</a> and a ring on a finger as the <a href="Bride%20of%20Christ">Bride of Christ</a>. Reinforcing this, the <a href="Marian%20blue">blue colour</a> of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of <a href="Gothic%20sculpture">Gothic sculpture</a>.

The pictorial space is bathed in soft light, probably an influence from <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>. The light falls from the right, throwing shadows of both Mary and the Child's heads on the left wall of the niche. The Virgin and Child are shown seated in a small Gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto a lawn. The painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail; for example, there are four small holes above each arch, likely to hold scaffolding.

As with other early van der Weyden depictions of the Madonna, her head is slightly too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's "Virgin and Child before a Firescreen"; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29%23Foreshortening">foreshortening</a> and in the depiction of a body under clothing.

The chapel is unrealistically small compared to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the <a href="Redemption%20%28theology%29%23Christianity">Redemption</a>. The panel is one of three surviving of van der Weyden's in which both Madonna and Child are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that the niche exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous with the edge of the painting, almost as part of the frame, a reason why it is thought to predate "<a href="Madonna%20Standing%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">The Madonna Standing</a>".

There are symmetrical differences between the left- and right-hand sides of the painting. This is most noticeable with the <a href="buttress">buttress</a>, where the receding edges are over half again the size of those on the front sides. In addition, the breadth of the buttress contradicts the spatial depth of the much tighter space inhabited by the Virgin and Child. This is a technical issue with foreshortening Campin also struggled with, but which van der Weyden resolves in his mature work.
The work is rich in symbolism and iconographic elements, to an extent far more pronounced than that in "The Madonna Standing". An <a href="iris%20%28plant%29%23In%20art%20and%20symbolism">iris</a> grows to the side of the <a href="aedicula">aedicula</a>, representing the Virgin's sorrow at the <a href="Passion%20%28Christianity%29">Passion</a>, and on the other side a <a href="aquilegia">columbine</a>, recalling the <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Sorrows">Sorrows of the Virgin</a>. This symbolic use of flowers is again a van Eyckian motif. While they may appear incongruous with the architectural setting, this was probably the effect that van der Weyden was seeking.

The <a href="lintel">lintel</a> contains six <a href="relief">relief</a>s from the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> of scenes from the <a href="Life%20of%20the%20Virgin">Life of the Virgin</a>. The first four, the <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a>, <a href="Visitation%20%28Christianity%29">Visitation</a>, <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">Nativity</a> and <a href="Adoration%20of%20the%20Magi">Adoration of the Magi</a>, are associated with motherhood and infancy. They are followed by the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">Resurrection</a> and <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a>. Above them, surmounting a <a href="Passion%20flower%23Etymology%20and%20names">"cross flower"</a>, is the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20Virgin">Coronation of the Virgin</a>. The <a href="jamb">jamb</a>s on either side of the Virgin are adorned with statues, most likely of <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> prophets. Of these only <a href="David">David</a>, second to the left, has been identified. The bearded man to David's left is probably <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, the man in the cap to the right is most likely the "weeping prophet" <a href="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>. On the opposite side, the outer figures may be <a href="Zechariah%20%28Hebrew%20prophet%29">Zechariah</a> and <a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a>.

In his usage of <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a>, van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm of flesh and blood, and the divine, represented by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time. Art historian Shirley Blum believes these figures were relegated to the architectural elements so as not to crowd the central devotional image.

The arrangement of the sculptural elements may have been influenced by <a href="Claus%20Sluter">Claus Sluter</a>'s "<a href="Well%20of%20Moses">Well of Moses</a>" (c. 1395–1403), which has a similar alignment. In the <a href="Chartreuse%20de%20Champmol">Chartreuse de Champmol</a>, the prophets represent the judges of Christ ("Secundum legem debet mori", "according to that law he ought to 
die") and are thus tied to the crucifixion. In the van der Weyden they are associated with the Virgin. Although portraying figures in niches has a long tradition in <a href="Northern%20Renaissance%23Art">Northern art</a>, rendering the figures as sculpture was unique to the 1430s, and first appears in van Eyck's "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>".

The panel may have been conceived as either the left-hand wing of a since dismantled diptych, or as the front piece of a double-sided panel. Art historian <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> suggests that the Washington "Saint George and the Dragon" of 1432–35 is the most likely opposite wing. In that work, <a href="Saint%20George%20and%20the%20Dragon">St. George</a>, facing inwards and to the right, slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing might seem incongruous, his "Madonna Standing" is widely thought to have been attached with the "St. Catherine of Alexandria" in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both left-hand panels, the Madonna and Child are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces.

Blum suggests that van der Weyden sought to juxtapose the otherworldly realm of the Madonna and Child with the earthly setting and contemporary dress of the saints. She describes the couplings as serving to position each saint "as a 'living witness' to the static, eternal presence of the Virgin and Child". She writes that "Only in such early works do we find this kind of obvious solution. By the time of the "<a href="The%20Descent%20from%20the%20Cross%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Descent from the Cross</a>" and "<a href="Dur%C3%A1n%20Madonna">Durán Madonna</a>", van der Weyden has already worked out a far more complex and effective means of mixing temporal and non-temporal effects".

The panel closely resembles van der Weyden's c. 1430–32 "<a href="Madonna%20Standing%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Madonna Standing</a>", and seems influenced by the work of Robert Campin, under whom he served his apprenticeship. It is especially close to Campin's 1430 "Virgin and Child before a Firescreen", now in London; one of the last works Campin completed before van der Weyden left his studio on 1 August 1432. In both, the Virgin has large, full, breasts, her fingers pressing as she nurses the Child. There are further similarities in her facial features and expression; the colour, style, and position of her hair; as well her pose. <a href="Lorne%20Campbell%20%28art%20historian%29">Lorne Campbell</a> attributes the work to van der Weyden's workshop, while art historian John Ward credits it to Campin and gives a date of c. 1435.
Ward's thesis is based on the fact that the Thyssen panel, so named after its home at the <a href="Thyssen-Bornemisza%20Museum">Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum</a>, is overwhelmingly influenced by Campin, while the contemporaneous and more sophisticated "Madonna Standing" draws heavily from van Eyck. He finds such a sudden shift unlikely, while also pointing out that this work evidences some technical difficulties that Campin was never to resolve, especially in respect to foreshortening and the rendering of the body beneath the robes. He also points to the architectural similarities in Campin's "Marriage of Mary", although this may be a matter of influence.

The painting was completed early in van der Weyden's career, probably just after his apprenticeship with Robert Campin ended. Although highly accomplished, it is filled with symbolism of a kind absent from his more mature works. It is one of three attributed paintings, all early works, that show the Virgin and Child set within an architectural setting, surrounded with painted sculptural figures, the others being "The Madonna Standing" and the "Durán Madonna".

Sculptural figuration was to become a hallmark of van der Weyden's mature work, and is best typified by the Madrid "Descent", where the mourning figures are shaped and take on poses more usually seen in sculpture. <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> identified this work and "The Madonna Standing" as van der Weyden's earliest extant work; they are also his smallest panels. Panofsky dated both panels as 1432–34, and believed them to be early works based on stylistic reasons, their near miniature scale, and because of the evident influences of both Campin and van Eyck.

Yugoslav monitor Drava

The Yugoslav monitor "Drava was a <a href="river%20monitor">river monitor</a> operated by the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> between 1921 and 1941. She was originally built for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> as the <a href="lead%20ship">name ship</a> of the <a href="Enns-class%20river%20monitor">"Enns"-class</a> river monitors. As SMS "Enns, she was part of the <a href="Danube%20Flotilla%20%28Austria-Hungary%29">Danube Flotilla</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and fought against the <a href="Serbian%20Army">Serbian</a> and <a href="Romanian%20Land%20Forces%23World%20War%20I">Romanian</a> armies from Belgrade to the lower <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. In October 1915, she was covering an amphibious assault on Belgrade when she was holed below the waterline by a direct hit, and had to be towed to Budapest for repairs. After brief service with the <a href="First%20Hungarian%20Republic">Hungarian People's Republic</a> at the end of the war, she was transferred to the newly created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later Yugoslavia), and renamed "Drava". She remained in service throughout the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, but was not always in full commission due to budget restrictions.

During the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, "Drava" spent six days shelling airfields near <a href="Moh%C3%A1cs">Mohács</a> in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Hungary</a> and fought off a small flotilla of Hungarian gunboats. On 12 April, she was attacked by <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> "Stuka" <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s of the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>. The anti-aircraft gunners on the ship claimed three enemy aircraft, but nine of the "Stukas" scored hits. Most of these had little effect, but the last bomb dropped straight down "Drava"s funnel and exploded in her engine room, killing 54 of the crew, including her captain, <a href="Aleksandar%20Beri%C4%87">Aleksandar Berić</a>. Only 13 of the crew survived. She was raised and scrapped by Hungary during their <a href="Hungarian%20occupation%20of%20Yugoslav%20territories">occupation of parts of Yugoslavia</a>. Berić was posthumously awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20Kara%C4%91or%C4%91e%27s%20Star">Order of Karađorđe's Star</a> for his sacrifice, and the base of the <a href="Serbian%20River%20Flotilla">Serbian River Flotilla</a> at <a href="Novi%20Sad">Novi Sad</a> is named after him.

SMS "Enns" was constructed for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> as the <a href="lead%20ship">name ship</a> of the <a href="Enns-class%20river%20monitor">"Enns"-class river monitor</a>s by <a href="Schiffswerft%20Linz">Schiffswerft Linz</a> and <a href="Stabilimento%20Tecnico%20Triestino">Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino</a> (STT). She was laid down by Schiffswerft Linz at <a href="Linz">Linz</a> on 21 November 1913, as part of the Austro-Hungarian 1912 Naval Program. She was named after the <a href="Enns%20%28river%29">River Enns</a>, a tributary of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. When <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> broke out in July 1914, construction of "Enns" was well advanced, but after Schiffswerft Linz was taken over by STT, her machinery was ordered from the STT works near <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>. On 2 August, the machinery was dispatched by train to Linz and installation began without delay. She was launched in September 1914, and completed on 17 October of that year. Despite the requirement that "Enns" and be constructed as <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s, and the fact that their size and armament were identical, there were significant design differences between the two vessels, as they were constructed by completely independent shipbuilding companies. "Enns" had an <a href="Length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . Her <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard displacement</a> was , and her crew consisted of 95 officers and enlisted men. She had two <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine">triple-expansion steam engine</a>s, each driving a single propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was provided by two <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow water-tube boiler</a>s, and her engines were rated at , with a maximum of . She was designed to reach a top speed of , and carried of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>.

"Enns" was armed with one twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a> of L/45 guns mounted forward, and three single L/10 <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> turrets mounted on the aft deck. On the upper deck there were two single <a href="%C5%A0koda%207%20cm%20K10"></a> L/50 <a href="anti-air%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns, one on the port side forward of the funnel, and one on the starboard side to the rear of the funnel. She was also equipped with six machine guns. The maximum range of her <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> L/45 guns was , and her howitzers could fire their shells a maximum of . Her armour consisted of <a href="Armor%20belt">belt</a> and <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s thick and <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armour thick, and her <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and gun turrets were thick.

The original plans called for open anti-aircraft mounts, but the experience of the existing monitors in the first battles on the Danube against <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a> demonstrated that the mounts needed protection from small arms fire, so armoured <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were added. These modifications prevented the crew in the conning tower from viewing directly aft of the ship, so a high rectangular platform was placed on top of the conning tower that afforded a view aft. To avoid any increase in her draught from these modifications, her hull was lengthened. Due to the urgent need for the ship to be put into service, the planned telescopic mast was not installed, and an alternative mast was constructed using angle iron lattice. "Enns" was launched on 29 July 1914 and commissioned on 17 October 1914.

Soon after "Enns" was commissioned into the <a href="Danube%20Flotilla%20%28Austria-Hungary%29">Danube Flotilla</a> she was in action against Serbian forces at Belgrade, under the command of "<a href="Linienschiffsleutnant">Linienschiffsleutnant</a>" (LSL) Richard Funk. French artillery support arrived in Belgrade in November, endangering the monitor's anchorage, with "Enns" being the only monitor in the flotilla with the range to match the French guns. On 21 November, "Enns" engaged the French battery in an artillery duel at a range of . This stalemate continued until the following month when the Serbs briefly evacuated Belgrade in the face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. After less than two weeks, the Austrians had to withdraw from Belgrade, and it was soon re-occupied by the Serbs, reinforced by the Russians and French. "Enns" continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until late December, when the monitor base was withdrawn to <a href="Petrovaradin">Petrovaradin</a> for the winter.

In January 1915, British artillery arrived in Belgrade, further bolstering its defences. In mid-February, the monitors redeployed to an anchorage at <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a>. Following the commencement of the <a href="Gallipoli%20campaign">Gallipoli campaign</a>, munitions supply to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottomans</a> became critical, and despite the failure of an earlier attempt to ship arms and ammunition down the Danube, another attempt was planned. On 30 March, the steamer "Belgrad" left Zemun, escorted by "Enns" and the monitor . The convoy was undetected as it sailed past Belgrade at night during a storm, but after the monitors returned to base, the steamer struck a mine near <a href="Vin%C4%8Da">Vinča</a>, and after coming under heavy artillery fire, exploded near <a href="Ritopek">Ritopek</a>. On 22 April 1915, a British picket boat that had been brought overland by rail from <a href="Thessaloniki">Salonika</a> was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun, firing two torpedoes without success. In September 1915, the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> were joined by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, and the Serbian Army soon faced overwhelming Austrian and German ground troops. In early October, the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28Austria-Hungary%29">Austro-Hungarian Third Army</a> attacked Belgrade, and "Enns", along with the majority of the flotilla, was heavily engaged in support of the crossings near the <a href="Belgrade%20Fortress">Belgrade Fortress</a> and <a href="Ada%20Ciganlija">Ada Ciganlija</a> island. During the final river crossing and support of the resulting <a href="bridgehead">bridgehead</a>, "Enns" was near <a href="Great%20War%20Island">Grosser Krieg</a> Island on 8 October when she received a direct hit below the <a href="waterline">waterline</a> and her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29%23Naval%20magazines">magazine</a> flooded. She was towed out of danger by the armed steamer "Almos", and was eventually hauled to Budapest where she was repaired. During repairs, the barbettes on her upper deck were replaced with turrets for the anti-aircraft guns. Although the howitzers had not been particularly successful, a plan to replace the aft howitzer mount with a turret similar to that used on SMS "Bodrog" was not carried out.

When she returned to the flotilla after repairs, she saw action at <a href="Oryahovo">Rjahovo</a> in early October 1916, where she contributed to the defeat of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romanian</a> <a href="Fl%C4%83m%C3%A2nda%20Offensive">Flămânda Offensive</a>. The Romanian attempt to cross the Danube to attack the rear of "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" <a href="August%20von%20Mackensen">August von Mackensen</a>'s Austro-Hungarian Third Army was thwarted, and a force consisting of "Enns", the monitors , and , the patrol boat "Viza" and the armed steamer "Balaton" destroyed a <a href="pontoon%20bridge">pontoon bridge</a> near Rjahovo. After forays against <a href="Giurgiu">Giurgiu</a> to secure trains loaded with coal and oil, in November "Enns" and other ships supported the crossing of the Danube by von Mackensen's army at <a href="Svishtov">Sistow</a>. The following month, "Enns" bombarded <a href="C%C4%83scioarele">Căscioarele</a>, driving enemy troops out of the village. From late December 1916 to mid-March 1917, "Enns" and other ships of the flotilla wintered at <a href="Drobeta-Turnu%20Severin">Turnu Severin</a>.

In March 1917, "Enns" relocated to <a href="Br%C4%83ila">Brăila</a> in eastern Romania, where it remained until July 1918. Sent to Linz and Budapest for an <a href="Maintenance%2C%20repair%2C%20and%20operations">overhaul</a> in <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a>, "Enns" then returned to eastern Romania and was stationed at <a href="Reni%2C%20Ukraine">Reni</a> where she met a group of monitors and patrol boats that had been operating against <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. In October 1918, the Danube Flotilla was under serious threat of being cut off in the lower Danube by <a href="French%20Army%20in%20World%20War%20I">French</a> forces after the Bulgarians concluded an armistice with the British and French. After the steamer "Croatia" was fired on by the French as it tried to get past <a href="Lom%2C%20Bulgaria">Lom</a>, she cut her tow line, releasing seven <a href="Lighter%20%28barge%29">lighters</a>, which ran aground on a sandbank. "Croatia" was hit, suffered casualties and grounded on the Romanian side of the river. The French retrieved three of the lighters and towed them into the anchorage at Lom. The following day, "Enns" and two other monitors managed to release three of the remaining lighters while under heavy French fire, and towed them upstream. The flotilla continued to retreat up the Danube, running the gauntlet of French and Serbian forces. With the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in early November, the <a href="South%20Slavs">South Slavs</a> went ashore at <a href="Vukovar">Vukovar</a>. The Austrian, Hungarian and Czech crew members of the flotilla continued on their journey, arriving in Budapest on 6 November, and "Enns" began flying the Hungarian flag, as part of the navy of the <a href="First%20Hungarian%20Republic">Hungarian People's Republic</a>. On 8 December, the monitors were seized by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a>, and less than two weeks later "Enns" was towed to Belgrade where she was handed over to Serbia to be maintained on behalf of the new <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia).

Immediately after the armistice, "Enns" was crewed by sailors of the KSCS in 1918–19. Under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a> concluded in September 1919, "Enns" was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors, and was officially handed over to the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">KSCS navy</a> and renamed "Drava" in 1920. Her sister ship "Inn" was transferred to Romania and renamed "Besarabia". In 1925–26, "Drava" was refitted, but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time. In 1932, the British naval <a href="attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets.

"Drava" was based at <a href="Bezdan">Bezdan</a> under the command of <a href="Aleksandar%20Beri%C4%87">Aleksandar Berić</a>, when the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> began on 6 April 1941. She was assigned as flagship of the 1st Mine Barrage Division, and was responsible for the Hungarian border on the Danube, under the operational control of the <a href="30th%20Infantry%20Division%20Osije%C4%8Dka">30th Infantry Division "Osiječka"</a>, which was part of the <a href="2nd%20Army%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">2nd Army</a>. "Drava" steamed upstream to <a href="Moh%C3%A1cs">Mohács</a> in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Hungary</a> to shell the airfield there on 6 and 8 April, but was subjected to daily attacks by the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>". On 10 April, "Drava" and her fellow monitor were ordered to sail downstream to conform with the withdrawals of the <a href="1st%20Army%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">1st</a> and 2nd Army's from <a href="Ba%C4%8Dka">Bačka</a> and <a href="Baranja">Baranja</a>. About 14:00 the following day, a Yugoslav lookout near <a href="Batina">Batina</a> signalled "Drava" that a group of four Hungarian patrol boats, armed with guns, was coming down the Danube from the direction of Mohács. "Drava" engaged the patrol boats at a range of , and drove the small Hungarian flotilla north again. Berić followed this up at 16:00 by once again shelling the airfield at Mohács. Morale on the ship was good, but when Berić met with Army elements later that day he became aware of the situation elsewhere, and nine crew deserted.

Early on 12 April, with the other three monitors having been scuttled the night before, "Drava" was attacked by <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> "Stuka" <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s of <a href="Sturzkampfgeschwader%2077">"Sturzkampfgeschwader" 77</a> flying from <a href="Arad%2C%20Romania">Arad, Romania</a>. The anti-aircraft gunners on the ship claimed three enemy aircraft, and nine of the "Stukas" scored hits on her, most of which had little effect. However, the last bomb dropped straight down her funnel and exploded in her engine room, killing 54 of the crew. Only 13 survived, and she sank off <a href="%C4%8Celarevo">Čib</a>. Having ordered the burning of <a href="Cryptography">codes</a> before she sank, Berić and his first officers were among the dead, but two of the successful anti-aircraft gunners, Rade Milojević and Miroslav Šurdilović, survived. During their <a href="Hungarian%20occupation%20of%20Yugoslav%20territories">occupation of parts of Yugoslavia</a>, "Drava" was raised and then scrapped by Hungary. Berić was posthumously awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20Kara%C4%91or%C4%91e%27s%20Star">Order of Karađorđe's Star</a> for his sacrifice. In April 2015, a <a href="Bust%20%28sculpture%29">bust</a> of Berić was unveiled at the village of <a href="Belegi%C5%A1">Belegiš</a>, near <a href="Stara%20Pazova">Stara Pazova</a>. The barracks of the <a href="Serbian%20River%20Flotilla">Serbian River Flotilla</a> in <a href="Novi%20Sad">Novi Sad</a> are also named after him.

Geology Hall, formerly Geological Hall, is a building located in the historic <a href="Queens%20Campus">Queens Campus</a> section of <a href="Rutgers%2C%20The%20State%20University%20of%20New%20Jersey">Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</a>'s College Avenue Campus in <a href="New%20Brunswick%2C%20New%20Jersey">New Brunswick</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. As part of the Queen's Campus, Geology Hall was included on the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">New Jersey Register of Historic Places</a> and the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1973. When Rutgers was selected as New Jersey's only <a href="Land-grant%20university">land grant college</a> in 1864, the college began to expand its curriculum to include instruction in science and agriculture. Rutgers president <a href="William%20Henry%20Campbell%20%28college%20president%29">William Henry Campbell</a> raised funds to construct a building to accommodate this expansion, and Geology Hall, designed by architect <a href="Henry%20Janeway%20Hardenbergh">Henry Janeway Hardenbergh</a>, was built in 1872.

At present, the building houses administrative offices and the university's geological museum. The museum, one of the oldest collegiate geology collections in the United States, was founded by state geologist and Rutgers professor <a href="George%20Hammell%20Cook">George Hammell Cook</a> in 1872. Its exhibits showcase the <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a> of New Jersey; focusing <a href="geology">geology</a>, <a href="paleontology">paleontology</a>, and <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>. Exhibits include fluorescent zinc minerals from <a href="Franklin%2C%20New%20Jersey">Franklin</a> and <a href="Ogdensburg%2C%20New%20Jersey">Ogdensburg</a>, a <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a> from <a href="Salem%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Salem County</a>, a dinosaur trackway discovered in <a href="Towaco%2C%20New%20Jersey">Towaco</a>, and a <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic era</a> Egyptian <a href="mummy">mummy</a>.

In 1864 the State of New Jersey named Rutgers College as their sole <a href="Land-grant%20university">land grant college</a>. Pursuant to the <a href="Morrill%20Land-Grant%20Acts">Morrill Act of 1862</a>, this designation gave federal lands to the state that the state could then sell to raise money to develop practical education in agriculture, science, military science and engineering.
<a href="George%20Hammell%20Cook">George Hammell Cook</a> (1818-1889), a professor of chemistry and natural sciences, influenced the state to select Rutgers over the College of New Jersey (now <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>). Cook was appointed state geologist in 1864 and later became the college's vice president. With the college's land grant status and new funding for scientific studies, Cook expanded his research and teaching into geology and agriculture.

Six years later, the college's <a href="Board%20of%20directors">board of trustees</a> decided to erect a building to house the college's new scientific programs. At this time, Rutgers was celebrating the centennial anniversary of its second charter (1770) and college president <a href="William%20Henry%20Campbell%20%28college%20president%29">William Henry Campbell</a> (1808–1890) solicited donations from alumni and other supporters in an extensive fundraising effort aimed at supporting these new programs. With these funds, the trustees commissioned a design for a Geological Hall from <a href="Henry%20Janeway%20Hardenbergh">Henry Janeway Hardenbergh</a> (1847–1918), a young architect from New Brunswick. Hardenbergh received these contracts through family connections, as several members of his family were graduates, trustees, or associated with the school. His great-great-grandfather, the Rev. <a href="Jacob%20Rutsen%20Hardenbergh">Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh</a> (1736–1790), was <a href="List%20of%20Rutgers%20University%20presidents">Rutgers' first president</a> and one of its founders, and his grandfather, Rev. Jacob Janeway served as vice president of the college and had turned down the post of president in 1840.
Hardenbergh's design was described as employing both Gothic elements and <a href="Classical%20architecture">classical</a> forms that preceded the extreme <a href="Eclecticism%20in%20architecture">eclecticism</a> that was to mark a later <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> Gothic Revival period. The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of <a href="red%20brick">red brick</a>, but the final execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark. Geology Hall, built on the south side of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now <a href="Alexander%20Johnston%20Hall">Alexander Johnston Hall</a>) that housed the college's grammar school (now <a href="Rutgers%20Preparatory%20School">Rutgers Preparatory School</a>) the year before. The third project, <a href="Kirkpatrick%20Chapel">Kirkpatrick Chapel</a> (1873), was designed to complement the simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.

The building was completed in 1872 at a cost of US$63,201.54 (2013: US$1,215,365). Geology Hall's first floor provided the college with rooms for laboratory and lecture instruction and housed the college's armory. The first-floor classrooms would accommodate the college's physics, military science, and geology departments. Geology Hall also provided instruction space for courses in agriculture, chemistry and engineering for several years, until Rutgers built <a href="Voorhees%20Mall">New Jersey Hall</a> (1889) to house the <a href="Agricultural%20experiment%20station%23United%20States">Agricultural Experiment Station</a>, and buildings for the Chemistry and Engineering departments (1909 and 1910 respectively) across Hamilton Street on land that became the college's <a href="Voorhees%20Mall">Voorhees Mall</a>. Geology Hall's second floor was designed to provide sufficient space to house the college's natural history artefacts and geological specimens as a museum.

Today, Geology Hall houses some of the offices of the university's administration and the Rutgers Geology Museum. Previously, it housed the offices of the Rutgers geology department, now called the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, from 1872 until 1979, when it moved to the university's <a href="Busch%20Campus">Busch Campus</a> in <a href="Piscataway%2C%20New%20Jersey">Piscataway</a>. This was the last of the university's science department to move across the <a href="Raritan%20River">Raritan River</a> to the Busch campus. In 1973, Geology Hall was included with six other buildings on Rutgers' Queen's Campus on the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">New Jersey Register of Historic Places</a> and the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

Cook established the university's geology museum in 1872 with specimens collected during the New Jersey Geological Survey which he directed as New Jersey's state geologist. Since then, the museum has operated on the building's second floor, offering free tours to small groups, schools, and to the general public. The museum's collections, of which only a small portion is on display, feature exhibits on geology, natural history, paleontology, and anthropology, with an emphasis on the natural history of New Jersey.

The museum's earliest collections began to coalesce in 1836 through the work of Lewis C. Beck (1798–1853), a physician, botanist, entomologist, chemist and geologist, who taught at Rutgers in the mid-nineteenth century from 1830 until his death in 1853. Many of the exhibits feature items that are unique to New Jersey, including Native American artifacts, minerals, and fossils. These exhibits include a set of <a href="Trace%20fossil">fossilized dinosaur tracks</a> believed to belong to the <a href="Carnivore">carnivorous</a> "<a href="Grallator">Grallator</a>", from the Jurassic-period discovered near <a href="Towaco%2C%20New%20Jersey">Towaco</a> in <a href="Morris%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morris County</a>, and the skeleton of a 10,000-year old <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a> ("Mammut americanum") discovered in <a href="Salem%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Salem County</a> in 1869. The mastodon, found in a marl pit near <a href="Mannington%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mannington</a>, was sold by a local farmer to a travelling circus before it was acquired by Rutgers for display.

A collection of around 2,400 specimens (including some <a href="Fluorescence%23Fluorescence%20in%20nature%23Gemology%2C%20mineralogy%2C%20and%20geology">fluorescent minerals</a>) was donated to the museum in October 1940 by George Rowe, a mine captain with the <a href="Horsehead%20Corporation">New Jersey Zinc Company</a>. The collection is rich in rare minerals, many of which found during twentieth-century <a href="zinc%20mining">zinc mining</a> operations in <a href="Franklin%2C%20New%20Jersey">Franklin, New Jersey</a>. This museum's holdings were augmented with the donation of 6,000 fluorescent mineral specimens collected by Anne and Milton Hershhorn. This exhibit opened to the public in October 2002.

The museum displays a 2,400-year-old female Egyptian <a href="mummy">mummy</a> on loan from the <a href="New%20Brunswick%20Theological%20Seminary">New Brunswick Theological Seminary</a>. The mummy, which dates to 320 or 330 B.C. in the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic era</a>, was discovered in Northern Egypt and brought back to the United States by a <a href="Reformed%20Church%20in%20America">Dutch Reformed</a> missionary who served there in the early 1700s. Little else is known about the mummy's origins, but it was stored in a closet at the seminary until 1968 when it was first put on display.

In 2013, rumors suggested that the university administration was planning to place the museum's exhibits in permanent storage, close the museum and renovate Geology Hall for use as an auditorium. A letter-writing campaign from alumni and the general public persuaded the administration to commit towards continuing the museum and expanding its mission.

Yugoslav monitor Sava

The Yugoslav monitor "Sava was a <a href="Temes-class%20river%20monitor">"Temes"-class</a> <a href="river%20monitor">river monitor</a> built for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> as SMS "Bodrog. She fired the first shots of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> on the night of 28 July 1914, when she and two other monitors shelled Serbian defences near <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>. She was part of the <a href="Danube%20Flotilla%20%28Austria-Hungary%29">Danube Flotilla</a>, and fought the <a href="Royal%20Serbian%20Army">Serbian</a> and <a href="Romanian%20Land%20Forces%23World%20War%20I">Romanian</a> armies from Belgrade to the <a href="Danube%20Delta">mouth of the Danube</a>. In the closing stages of the war, she was the last monitor to withdraw towards <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, but was captured by the Serbs when she <a href="ship%20grounding">grounded</a> on a sandbank downstream from Belgrade. After the war, she was transferred to the newly created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later Yugoslavia), and renamed "Sava". She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions meant she was not always in full commission.

During the German-led <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, "Sava" served with the 1st Monitor Division. Along with her fellow monitor , she laid <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> in the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> near the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romanian</a> border during the first few days of the invasion. The two monitors fought off several attacks by the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>", but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigation was difficult, and "Sava" was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> on 11 April. Some of her crew tried to escape cross-country towards the southern <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> coast, but all were captured prior to the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia%23Armistice%20and%20surrender">Yugoslav surrender</a>. The vessel was later raised by the <a href="Navy%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">navy</a> of the Axis <a href="puppet%20state">puppet state</a> known as the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> and continued to serve as "Sava" until the night of 8 September 1944 when she was again scuttled.

Following World War II, "Sava" was raised once again, and was refurbished to serve in the <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> from 1952 to 1962. She was then transferred to a state-owned company that was eventually privatised. In 2005, the <a href="government%20of%20Serbia">government of Serbia</a> granted her limited heritage protection after citizens demanded that she be preserved as a <a href="museum%20ship">floating museum</a>, but little else has been done to restore her at the time. In 2015, the Serbian <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Serbia%29">Ministry of Defence</a> and Belgrade's <a href="Military%20Museum%2C%20Belgrade">Military Museum</a> acquired the ship with the intent of restoring her.

A <a href="Temes-class%20river%20monitor">"Temes"-class</a> <a href="river%20monitor">river monitor</a>, the ship was built for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> by <a href="Ganz%20Works">H. Schönichen</a>, and designed by Austrian naval architect Josef Thiel. Originally named SMS "Bodrog", she was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> at <a href="%C3%9Ajpest">Neupest</a> on 14 February 1903. Like her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> , she had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . Her <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard displacement</a> was , and her crew consisted of 86 officers and enlisted men. "Bodrog" had two <a href="marine%20steam%20engine">triple-expansion steam engine</a>s, each driving a single propeller shaft. Steam was provided by two <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow water-tube boiler</a>s, and her engines were rated at . As designed, she had a maximum speed of , and carried of coal.

"Bodrog" was armed with two L/35 guns in single <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, a single L/10 <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> in a <a href="pivot%20gun">central pivot mount</a>, and two guns. The maximum range of her <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> 120 mm guns was , and her howitzer could fire its shells a maximum of . Her armour consisted of <a href="armor%20belt">belt</a>, <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s and gun turrets thick, and <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armour thick. The armour on her <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was thick. "Bodrog" was <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 12 April 1904, <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 2 August 1904, and completed on 10 November 1904.

"Bodrog" was part of the <a href="Danube%20Flotilla%20%28Austria-Hungary%29">Danube Flotilla</a>, and at the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> she was based in <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a>, just upstream from <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> on the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, under the command of "<a href="Linienschiffsleutnant">Linienschiffsleutnant</a>" (LSL) Paul Ekl. She shared the base with three other monitors and three <a href="patrol%20boat">patrol boat</a>s. Austria-Hungary declared war on <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a> on 28 July 1914, and a little after 1:00 AM that night, "Bodrog" and two other monitors fired the first shots of the war against Serb fortifications on the Zemun–Belgrade railway bridge over the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> river and on <a href="Top%C4%8Didersko%20Brdo">Topčider Hill</a>. The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors, and by August began to receive assistance from the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russians</a>. This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns and the establishment of river obstacles and <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a>. On 8 September, the Austro-Hungarian base at Zemun was evacuated in the face of a Serbian <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a>. "Bodrog" and the <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a> "Andor" conducted a deception operation towards <a href="Pan%C4%8Devo">Pančevo</a> on 19 September, and six days later, "Bodrog" bombarded Serb positions on the bank of the Sava near Belgrade. On 28 September, she rendezvoused with the monitor at <a href="Stari%20Banovci">Banovci</a>, and the following day the two monitors targeted the <a href="Belgrade%20Fortress">Belgrade Fortress</a> and conducted a reconnaissance of Zemun. On 1 October, "Bodrog" sailed to <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, where she was placed in <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> for two weeks. She returned to the flotilla on 15 October. By November, French artillery support had arrived in Belgrade, endangering the monitor's anchorage, and on 12 November, Ekl was replaced by LSL Olaf Wulff. The stalemate continued until the following month, when the Serbs evacuated Belgrade in the face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. On 1 December, "Bodrog" and the newly commissioned monitor engaged the retreating Serbs. After less than two weeks, the Austro-Hungarians retreated from Belgrade, and it was soon recaptured by the Serbs with Russian and French support. "Bodrog" continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December, when her base was withdrawn to <a href="Petrovaradin">Petrovaradin</a>, near <a href="Novi%20Sad">Novi Sad</a>, for the winter.

The Germans and Austro-Hungarians wanted to transport munitions down the Danube to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, so on 24 December 1914, "Bodrog" and the minesweeper "Almos" escorted the <a href="steamboat">steamer</a> "Trinitas" loaded with <a href="ammunition">munitions</a>, the <a href="patrol%20boat">patrol boat</a> "b" and two <a href="tugboat">tugs</a> from Zemun past Belgrade towards the <a href="Iron%20Gates">Iron Gates</a> gorge on the Serbian–Romanian border. The convoy ran the gauntlet of the Belgrade defences unharmed, but when it reached <a href="Smederevo">Smederevo</a> it received information that the Russians had established a minefield and log barrier just south of the Iron Gates. It turned back under heavy fire, and withdrew as far as Pančevo without serious damage to any vessel. "Bodrog" returned to base, and the monitor was sent to guard the munitions and escort the convoy back to Petrovaradin. In January 1915, British artillery arrived in Belgrade, further bolstering its defences, and "Bodrog" spent the first months of the year at Zemun. On 23 February, LSL Kosimus Böhm took command. On 1 March, "Bodrog" and several other vessels including the monitor were relocated to Petrovaradin. After the commencement of the <a href="Gallipoli%20campaign">Gallipoli campaign</a>, munitions supply to the Ottomans became critical, so another attempt was planned. On 30 March, the steamer "Belgrad" left Zemun, escorted by "Bodrog" and "Enns". The convoy was undetected as it sailed past Belgrade at night during a storm, but after the monitors returned to base, "Belgrad" struck a mine near <a href="Vin%C4%8Da">Vinča</a>, and after coming under heavy artillery fire, exploded near <a href="Ritopek">Ritopek</a>. On 22 April 1915, a British <a href="picket%20%28military%29">picket</a> boat that had been brought overland by rail from <a href="Thessaloniki">Salonika</a> was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun, firing two torpedoes without success.

In September 1915, the Central Powers were joined by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, and the Serbian Army soon faced an overwhelming Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian ground invasion. In early October, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army attacked Belgrade, and "Bodrog", along with the majority of the flotilla, was heavily engaged in support of crossings near the Belgrade Fortress and the island of <a href="Ada%20Ciganlija">Ada Ciganlija</a>.

Following the capture of Belgrade on 11 October and the initial clearance of mines and other obstacles, the flotilla sailed downstream to <a href="Or%C8%99ova">Orșova</a> near the Hungarian–Romanian border and waited for the lower Danube to be swept for mines. Commencing on 30 October 1915, they escorted a series of munitions convoys down the Danube to <a href="Lom%2C%20Bulgaria">Lom</a> where the munitions were transferred to the Bulgarian railway system for shipment to the Ottoman Empire.

In November 1915, "Bodrog" and the other monitors were assembled at <a href="Ruse%2C%20Bulgaria">Rustschuk</a>, Bulgaria. The <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> were aware that the Romanians were negotiating to enter the war on the side of the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Entente</a>, so the flotilla established a sheltered base in the <a href="Belene%20Island">Belene Canal</a> to protect the Danube border between Romania and Bulgaria. During 1915, the guns on the "Bodrog" were replaced with a single L/18 gun, and three machine guns were also fitted.

When the Romanians entered the war on 27 August 1916, the monitors were again at Rustschuk, and were immediately attacked by three improvised <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s operating out of the Romanian river port of <a href="Giurgiu">Giurgiu</a>. The torpedoes that were fired missed the monitors but struck a <a href="lighter%20%28barge%29">lighter</a> loaded with fuel. Tasked with shelling Giurgiu the following day, the Second Monitor <a href="division%20%28naval%29">Division</a>, consisting of "Bodrog" and three other monitors, set fire to oil storage tanks, the railway station and <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>, and sank several Romanian lighters. While the attack was underway, the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage. "Bodrog" and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a> on their way back to Belene. This was followed by forays of the Division both east and west of Belene, during which both <a href="Turnu%20M%C4%83gurele">Turnu Măgurele</a> and <a href="Zimnicea">Zimnicea</a> were shelled.

On 2 October 1916, "Bodrog" and "Körös" attacked a Romanian <a href="pontoon%20bridge">pontoon bridge</a> being established across the Danube at <a href="Oryahovo">Oryahovo</a>, obtaining five direct hits, thus contributing to the defeat of the Romanian <a href="Fl%C4%83m%C3%A2nda%20Offensive">Flămânda Offensive</a>. This was followed by action supporting the crossing of "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" <a href="August%20von%20Mackensen">August von Mackensen</a>'s Austro-Hungarian Third Army at <a href="Svishtov">Sistow</a>. "Bodrog" then wintered at <a href="Drobeta-Turnu%20Severin">Turnu Severin</a>.

From 21 February 1917, "Bodrog" and "Körös" were deployed as guardships at <a href="Br%C4%83ila">Brăila</a>. On 1 March, "Bodrog" became stuck in ice at nearby <a href="M%C4%83cin">Măcin</a>. LSL Guido Taschler took command of "Bodrog" in 1918. That year's spring thaw saw "Bodrog", "Körös", "Szamos", "Bosna" and several other vessels sent through the mouth of the Danube into the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> as part of "Flottenabteilung Wulff" (Fleet Division Wulff) under the command of "Flottenkapitän" (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff, arriving in <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a> on 12 April. On 15 July, she and "Bosna" sailed to the port of <a href="Mykolaiv">Nikolaev</a>, and from 5 August, "Bodrog" was stationed at <a href="Kherson">Cherson</a>. On 12 September, she returned to Brăila along with other vessels.

"Bodrog" was sent to <a href="Reni%2C%20Ukraine">Reni</a> near the mouth of the Danube to protect withdrawing Austro-Hungarian troops, arriving there on 1 October. She then sailed upstream, reaching Rustschuk on 11 October, and Giurgiu two days later. On 14 October, she was deployed at Lom. She was the last Austro-Hungarian monitor to withdraw towards Budapest and was the only one that failed to reach the city. On 31 October 1918, "Bodrog" collided with a sand bank while navigating through heavy fog near Vinča. She was later captured by the Serbian Army.

From the <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">Armistice</a> to September 1919, "Bodrog" was crewed by sailors of the newly created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (, KSCS; later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, "Bodrog" was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors, but was not officially handed over to the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">KSCS Navy</a> and renamed "Sava" until 15 April 1920. Her sister ship "Temes" was transferred to Romania and renamed "Ardeal". In 1925–26, "Sava" was refitted, but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time. In 1932, the British naval <a href="attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets.

"Sava" was based at <a href="Dubovac%20%28Kovin%29">Dubovac</a> when the German-led Axis <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> began on 6 April 1941. She was assigned to the 1st Monitor Division, and was responsible for the Romanian border on the Danube, under the operational control of the <a href="3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20Dunavska">3rd Infantry Division "Dunavska"</a>. Her commander was "Poručnik bojnog broda" S. Rojos.

On that day, "Sava" and her fellow monitor fought off several attacks by individual "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" aircraft on their base. Over the next three days, the two monitors laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border. On 11 April, they were forced to withdraw from Dubovac towards Belgrade. During their withdrawal, they came under repeated attacks by <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> "Stuka" <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s. "Sava" and her fellow monitor were undamaged, and anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade at about 20:00, where they were joined by the . The three captains conferred, and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant there was insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely. The crews of the monitors were then transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugs was passing under a railway bridge, charges on the bridge accidentally exploded and the bridge fell onto the tug. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed.

After the scuttling of the monitors, around 450 officers and men from the "Sava" and various other riverine vessels gathered at <a href="Obrenovac">Obrenovac</a>. Armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels, the crews started towards the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bay of Kotor</a> in the southern <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> in two groups. The smaller of the two groups reached its objective, but the larger group only made it as far as <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> by 14 April before they were obliged to surrender. The remainder made their way to the Bay of Kotor, which was captured by the <a href="XVII%20Corps%20%28Italy%29">Italian XVII Corps</a> on 17 April.

"Sava" was raised and repaired by the <a href="Navy%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">navy of the Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia</a>, and served alongside her fellow monitor "Morava", which was raised, repaired, and renamed "Bosna". Along with six captured motorboats and ten auxiliary vessels, they made up the riverine police force of the Croatian state. "Sava" was part of the 1st Patrol Group of the River Flotilla Command, headquartered at Zemun. Her crew scuttled her near <a href="Slavonski%20Brod">Slavonski Brod</a> on the night of 8 September 1944 and defected to the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a>.

"Sava" was again raised and refurbished after World War II. Armed with two single gun turrets, three single gun mounts and six weapons, she served in the <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> from 1952 to 1962. Afterwards, she was placed into the hands of a state-owned company, which was privatised after the <a href="breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia">breakup of Yugoslavia</a>. In 2005, the <a href="government%20of%20Serbia">government of Serbia</a> granted her limited heritage protection after citizens demanded that she be preserved as a floating museum, though little else had been done to restore her as of 2014, by which time she was serving as a gravel barge. In December 2015, "Sava" was acquired by the Serbian <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Serbia%29">Ministry of Defence</a> and Belgrade's <a href="Military%20Museum%2C%20Belgrade">Military Museum</a>, which plan on restoring her. The ship is one of only two surviving Austro-Hungarian river monitors that served during World War I. The other is <a href="SMS%20Leitha">SMS "Leitha"</a>, a much older monitor, which has been a museum ship anchored alongside the <a href="Hungarian%20Parliament%20Building">Hungarian Parliament Building</a> in Budapest since 2014.

2014 Japanese Grand Prix

The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the 2014 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor race held on 5 October 2014 at the <a href="Suzuka%20Circuit">Suzuka Circuit</a> in <a href="Suzuka%2C%20Mie">Suzuka, Mie</a>. It was the fifteenth race of the <a href="2014%20FIA%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship">2014 FIA Formula One World Championship</a>, and the 30th <a href="Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a> held as part of the Formula One World Championship. The 44-lap race was won by <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20in%20Formula%20One">Mercedes</a> driver <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a>, who started from second position. His teammate, <a href="Nico%20Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a>, finished second and <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull Racing</a> driver <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> came in third. It was Hamilton's eighth victory of the season, his first at Suzuka and the 30th of his Formula One career.

Heavy rain from <a href="Typhoon%20Phanfone%20%282014%29">Typhoon Phanfone</a> made the track surface wet and reduced visibility. Starting from behind the <a href="safety%20car">safety car</a>, the race was stopped after two laps and resumed 20 minutes later. Rosberg immediately fended off a passing manoeuvre by Hamilton heading into the first corner. His car then experienced <a href="Understeer%20and%20oversteer">oversteer</a>, and Hamilton reduced the time deficit between them. Hamilton challenged Rosberg for the lead over the next four laps, before overtaking him on the 29th lap and pulling away.

The race was scheduled to run for 53 laps, but was brought to an end on the 46th lap (with the result counted back two laps) after an accident involving <a href="Jules%20Bianchi">Jules Bianchi</a>. Bianchi lost control of his <a href="Marussia%20F1">Marussia</a> at Dunlop Curve on the 43rd lap and collided with a tractor crane that was tending to <a href="Adrian%20Sutil">Adrian Sutil</a>'s <a href="Sauber">Sauber</a>, which had spun off on the previous lap. Bianchi sustained severe head injuries in the accident, from which he died in his native France on 17 July 2015, thus becoming the first driver to die as a result of injuries sustained in a Formula One race since <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> in . The accident prompted Formula One's governing body, the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA), to investigate the incident with a ten-person panel in which it was determined there was no single cause that prompted the crash.

The victory allowed Hamilton to increase his lead in the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">World Drivers' Championship</a> to ten points over Rosberg, with <a href="Daniel%20Ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> a distant third. Mercedes extended their advantage over Red Bull in the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a>, and <a href="Williams%20Grand%20Prix%20Engineering">Williams</a> remained ahead of <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> in the battle for third place with four races left in the season.

The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was the 15th of 19 scheduled races of the <a href="2014%20FIA%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship">2014 FIA Formula One World Championship</a>, and the 30th running of the <a href="Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">event</a> as part of the Formula One World Championship. It was held on 5 October at the eighteeen-turn <a href="Suzuka%20Circuit">Suzuka Circuit</a> in <a href="Suzuka%2C%20Mie">Suzuka, Mie</a>. The event's official name was the "2014 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix", and it was scheduled to run for 53 laps.

<a href="Formula%20One%20tyres">Tyre</a> supplier <a href="Pirelli">Pirelli</a> brought four types of tyre to the race: two dry compounds (the white-banded medium "options" and the orange-banded hard "primes") and two <a href="Rain%20tyre">wet-weather</a> compounds (intermediate and full wet). The <a href="drag%20reduction%20system">drag reduction system</a> (DRS) had one activation zone for the race, on the <a href="Straight%20%28racing%29">straight</a> linking the final and first corners. The circuit underwent changes following the <a href="2013%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">previous year's</a> race; parts of the track between the 14th and 15th turns were resurfaced, TecPro barriers were installed on the inside after the exit of turn 15 and lamp posts near debris fences outside turns 13 and 14 were moved back.

Going into the race, <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20in%20Formula%20One">Mercedes</a> driver <a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 241 <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship%20points%20scoring%20systems">points</a>, three ahead of teammate <a href="Nico%20Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a>, with <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull</a> driver <a href="Daniel%20Ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> third with 181. <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a> was fourth with 133, followed by Ricciardo's teammate <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> with 124. Mercedes led the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors' Championship</a> with 479 points, having won eleven of the previous fourteen races of the season, while Red Bull were second with 305 points, having won the other three races; they were followed by <a href="Williams%20Grand%20Prix%20Engineering">Williams</a> (187), Ferrari (178) and <a href="Force%20India">Force India</a> (117). Mercedes had to outscore Red Bull by 41 points to clinch the Constructors' title in Japan.

Despite reclaiming the Drivers' Championship lead at the preceding <a href="2014%20Singapore%20Grand%20Prix">Singapore Grand Prix</a>, Hamilton said that he was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set his sights on a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal <a href="Christian%20Horner">Christian Horner</a> said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out <a href="team%20orders">team orders</a> favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.

<a href="Typhoon%20Phanfone%20%282014%29">Typhoon Phanfone</a>, classified as a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales">category-four</a> storm, was forecast to make landfall over the eastern Japanese coast on race day with heavy rain and winds of up to . Although the storm was predicted to miss Suzuka, heavy rain from its northern edge was expected to drench the circuit. The <a href="2014%20Russian%20Grand%20Prix">Russian Grand Prix</a>, scheduled for the following week, made it impossible for the Japanese Grand Prix to be postponed until Monday due to freight schedules to Russia for the teams' equipment. <a href="Bernie%20Ecclestone">Bernie Ecclestone</a>, owner of Formula One's commercial rights, raised the possibility of moving up the start time, but later said that the event would proceed as planned. The <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA) race director, <a href="Charlie%20Whiting">Charlie Whiting</a>, suggested to race organisers that the start time be moved and warned them that the race would not take place unless it was declared safe, but they refused. <a href="Honda">Honda</a>, the owners of the track, reportedly rejected the start time change to allow spectators to arrive at Suzuka in time for the start of the race. Whiting was also overruled by senior FIA officials, who opposed the disruption of the event's worldwide television coverage.

There were driver changes for the race's first free practice session. <a href="Max%20Verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> replaced <a href="Jean-%C3%89ric%20Vergne">Jean-Éric Vergne</a> as part of his preparation for a full-time seat at <a href="Scuderia%20Toro%20Rosso">Toro Rosso</a> in the season. Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person in history to participate in a Formula One race weekend. <a href="Caterham%20F1">Caterham</a> confirmed that <a href="Roberto%20Merhi">Roberto Merhi</a> would replace <a href="Marcus%20Ericsson">Marcus Ericsson</a>, and <a href="Kamui%20Kobayashi">Kamui Kobayashi</a> would drive in the race. <a href="2014%20Formula%20Renault%203.5%20Series">Formula Renault 3.5 Series</a> driver <a href="Will%20Stevens">Will Stevens</a> was announced as participating in the first practice session in <a href="Max%20Chilton">Max Chilton</a>'s car, but a problem with paperwork sent to the <a href="FIA%20Contract%20Recognition%20Board">FIA Contract Recognition Board</a> due to an <a href="industrial%20action">industrial action</a> in Germany prevented him from driving.

Three practice sessions – two on Friday and a third on Saturday – were held before the race on Sunday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations to see how the cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of <a href="Valtteri%20Bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> and <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a>, with <a href="Kevin%20Magnussen">Kevin Magnussen</a>, Ricciardo, <a href="Jenson%20Button">Jenson Button</a>, Vettel and <a href="Daniil%20Kvyat">Daniil Kvyat</a> rounding out the top ten. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled over to the side of the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken <a href="Poppet%20valve">exhaust valve</a>, while Merhi spun at turn 13, causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him.

In the second practice session, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the day at one minute and 35.078 seconds. Rosberg was second with Bottas third, followed by Button, Vettel and Räikkönen. The top ten was completed by Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an <a href="Understeer%20and%20oversteer">oversteer</a> sent him into the barrier at turn 18. Kobayashi lost control of the rear of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, while Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a <a href="fuel%20pump">fuel pump</a> problem. <a href="Esteban%20Guti%C3%A9rrez">Esteban Gutiérrez</a> later lost control of his <a href="Sauber">Sauber</a> entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14; this resulted in a second red flag, which brought the session to an early end due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a>, Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vergne, Kvyat and Button occupied positions four through ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the <a href="run-off%20area">run-off area</a> and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car, while Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear at the exit of turn 15 but avoided crashing into the wall.

Saturday afternoon's <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23Q">qualifying session</a> was divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 17th or below. The <a href="107%25%20rule">107% rule</a> was in effect during this part, requiring drivers to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap in order to qualify. The second part lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th, before the third and final part determined <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> to tenth. Cars in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. Rosberg set the fastest time in the second and third sessions to clinch his eighth pole position of the season, the twelfth of his career and his first at Suzuka with a lap time of one minute and 32.506 seconds. He was joined on the <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23G">grid</a>'s front row by Hamilton, who recorded a lap time nearly two-tenths of a second slower than his teammate. Hamilton missed out on pole position when, on his final lap, he hit the <a href="chicane">chicane</a> <a href="Curb">kerbing</a> before accelerating too fast into the final corner. Williams teammates Bottas and Massa qualified third and fourth, and Alonso and Ricciardo took fifth and sixth. Mangnussen, whose mistakes on his quickest timed lap cost him time, took seventh. His McLaren teammate, Button, secured eighth and locked one of his tyres—<a href="Flat%20spot">flat-spotting</a> it and slowing his times. Vettel, struggling on corners due partially to Red Bull's use of wet tyres, took ninth. Räikkönen rounded out the top ten qualifiers, encountering problems with his car's balance which prevented him from pushing hard.

Vergne was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 34.984 seconds was two seconds off Rosberg's pace in the second session. Because his team had changed his engine, he received a ten-place grid penalty, his sixth of the season. This promoted the Force India of <a href="Sergio%20P%C3%A9rez">Sergio Pérez</a> to 11th position; the Mexican driver had encountered slower cars entering the final chicane, which forced him to reduce his speed and lose brake and tyre temperature. Kvyat's final timed lap was disrupted by slower cars; when he entered the first corner his tyres had not reached their optimum temperature, compromising his run and leaving him 12th. <a href="Nico%20H%C3%BClkenberg">Nico Hülkenberg</a> qualified 13th in the other Force India after he locked his tyres at the final chicane. <a href="Adrian%20Sutil">Adrian Sutil</a> progressed to the second qualifying session after making <a href="Racing%20setup">balance set-up</a> changes, and took 14th in its closing seconds; his Sauber teammate, Gutiérrez, struggled with tyre temperature and was delayed by traffic on his <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23O">out-lap</a>, leaving him 15th. <a href="Pastor%20Maldonado">Pastor Maldonado</a> failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, but <a href="Lotus%20F1">Lotus</a> installed a new engine (his sixth of the year) in his <a href="Lotus%20E22">E22</a> chassis on Friday morning. Like Vergne, he incurred a ten-place grid penalty (carried over to the next race because he qualified within the top-ten bottom positions). His teammate, <a href="Romain%20Grosjean">Romain Grosjean</a>, took over 16th position and aimed to qualify higher; however, a change in wind direction prevented him from recording a faster lap time. Ericsson and Jules Bianchi started from 17th and 18th, with Kobayashi 19th and Vergne 20th. Chilton lost control of his <a href="Marussia%20F1">Marussia</a>'s rear, causing him to start 21st.

There was a large amount of standing water on the track at the start, since Typhoon Phanfone had brought heavy rain to the area. The air temperature was , and the track temperature was . About 142,000 people attended the race. The standing water caused heavy spray and impaired visibility, and all cars used full wet tyres. The race began behind the safety car at 15:00 <a href="Japan%20Standard%20Time">Japan Standard Time</a> (), with no <a href="Parade%20lap">formation lap</a>; despite the slow speed, drivers struggled for <a href="Grip%20%28auto%20racing%29">grip</a> on the wet surface. Ericsson lost control of his car after accelerating out of the final turn, spinning into the gravel trap; <a href="Motorsport%20marshal">marshals</a> pushed his car out of the gravel, enabling him to keep driving. Following complaints from Hamilton about poor visibility, the race was suspended after two laps. The cars drove back into the <a href="Pit%20stop">pit lane</a>, lined up in grid formation and their engines were shut off. Several cars had their <a href="ride%20height">ride height</a>s raised to make them less prone to <a href="aquaplaning">aquaplaning</a> on their underbody <a href="Skid%20block">planks</a>. The race was restarted 20 minutes later behind the safety car, after the rain eased. Alonso stopped his car with an electrical issue – possibly a short circuit from the wet conditions – to become the race's first retirement on lap 3. His departure promoted Ricciardo to fifth place, with Magnussen sixth and Button seventh.

Although Hamilton became concerned about his Mercedes' brakes, he was told that it was a relatively minor sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 9, and cars were allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Rosberg heading into the first corner, while Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the <a href="Hairpin%20turn">hairpin</a>, also without success; he then ran wide at the Spoon Curve but remained on the track. Pérez overtook Kvyat to claim ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.

Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit stops to change to intermediate tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the same lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops on lap 13, Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on lap 14 and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times in an attempt to move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off onto the run-off area at the Spoon Curve, reducing the gap by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, with Vettel moving to the inside line and passing Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on this lap; Ricciardo then attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, but Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.

Magnussen made a second pit stop at the end of lap 16 to change his steering wheel. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on lap 18; Bottas then fell to fifth on lap 19 when Ricciardo passed him around the outside at the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the gap to third-place Button, with Ricciardo driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but Vettel was still 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg, who now led Hamilton by only one second having run off the track at 130R. A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.

DRS was enabled on lap 24. Although Hamilton had closed Rosberg's lead to half a second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a pit stop this lap, which went wrong as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front <a href="Lug%20nut">wheel nut</a> correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his <a href="Drafting%20%28aerodynamics%29">slipstream</a>, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On lap 27, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear; his brakes locked, and he went into the turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.

Gutiérrez lost ninth position on lap 30 when he was passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water on the inside of the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second pit stop for intermediate tyres on the same lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button, still third, recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth position on the same lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; his pit crew also changed his steering wheel, lengthening the stop and putting him behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new <a href="fastest%20lap">fastest lap</a> of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton. Rosberg made his second pit stop, for new intermediate tyres, on lap 33 and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres, giving Ricciardo the lead. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36; Ricciardo made his pit stop during this lap and rejoined fifth, behind Hamilton, Rosberg, Vettel and Button.

On lap 38, Magnussen ran wide onto the first-turn run-off area, while Vergne went off the track at the second corner and Vettel drove into the gravel trap at the S-turns; all three drivers continued running. Ricciardo closed up to Button on the same lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the overall fastest lap of the race on lap 39, at one minute and 51.600 seconds. Weather conditions continued to deteriorate, resulting in DRS being disabled on lap 41; visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover, while drivers were being dazzled by the lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to overtake Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. Ricciardo finally got past at the hairpin on lap 42, with Button then making a pit stop for full wet tyres. On the same lap, Sutil aquaplaned into the outside tyre barrier at the top of the hill at Dunlop Curve. <a href="Racing%20flags%23Yellow%20flag">Double yellow flags</a> were waved at the corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a <a href="Mobile%20crane">tractor crane</a> that lap and turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Then, on lap 43, Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at , veering right towards the run-off area outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his <a href="fail-safe">fail-safe</a> system did not work because the settings of his <a href="brake-by-wire">brake-by-wire</a> system were incompatible.

Bianchi collided with the rear of the tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its <a href="Anti-roll%20bar">roll bar</a> was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of <a href="G-force">254 "g" (2,490 m/s)</a>, and data from the FIA's World Accident Database, which sources information from racing accidents worldwide, indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extricated from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather, so Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in <a href="Yokkaichi%2C%20Mie">Yokkaichi</a>, about 15 km (9.3 mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.

A second red flag was waved on lap 46, bringing the race to an early end; the results were taken from the running order at the end of lap 44. Hamilton thus won from teammate Rosberg by 9.1 seconds, with Vettel twenty seconds further back in third. Ricciardo finished just under ten seconds behind his Red Bull teammate, and nearly half a minute ahead of Button. Massa, Bottas, Hülkenberg, Vergne and Pérez rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kvyat, Räikkönen and Gutiérrez filled the next three positions, each one lap behind Hamilton, with Magnussen, Grosjean, Maldonado, Ericcson, Chilton and Kobayashi the last of the classified finishers who were not involved in any incident. Bianchi and Sutil were classified in 20th and 21st, despite their accidents. Hamilton and Rosberg both led on two occasions, with Rosberg leading 26 of the 44 laps and Hamilton the other 18. Hamilton's victory was his eighth of the season, his first at Suzuka, and the 30th of his Formula One career.

Out of respect for the seriously-injured Bianchi, the top three finishers did not spray champagne. At the podium interviews, conducted by the <a href="1992%20FIA%20Formula%20One%20World%20Championship">1992 World Champion</a> <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a>, Hamilton said that it had been a difficult race weekend and his speed near the end of the race was reminiscent of the <a href="2008%20British%20Grand%20Prix">2008 British Grand Prix</a>. Rosberg called it a good weekend for his team, and congratulated Hamilton on the victory. Vettel said that he was lucky that the safety car came out, and was happy with his performance. At a later press conference, Hamilton said that he was confident in his car's balance when he passed Rosberg on lap 28, and saw no difference in the amount of standing water on the track when more heavy rain fell. Although Rosberg's car was set up similar to Hamilton's, he was unhappy with its balance and tried to adjust it during his pit stop. According to Vettel, the weather was borderline and his team decided to make a pit stop when it deteriorated.

Bianchi's crash overshadowed the race. His father, Philippe, initially reported to "<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe">L'Équipe</a>" that Bianchi was in critical condition with a head injury and was undergoing an operation to reduce severe cranial bleeding. The FIA then said that <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a>s indicated that Bianchi sustained a "severe head injury" in the crash, and would be admitted to the <a href="intensive%20care%20unit">intensive care unit</a> after surgery. His family later reported that he had a <a href="diffuse%20axonal%20injury">diffuse axonal injury</a>, a <a href="traumatic%20brain%20injury">traumatic brain injury</a> common in vehicle accidents involving quick deceleration. The first family update after Bianchi's emergency surgery was made by his father during the week of 13 October; the driver was reportedly in a "desperate" condition, with doctors saying that his survival would be a miracle. His father said that he drew hope from the emergence of seven-time world champion <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> from his coma. Marussia also issued regular updates on Bianchi's condition, denying initial speculation about their role in the accident. Former FIA president <a href="Max%20Mosley">Max Mosley</a> described it as a "freak accident".
Controversy arose after an amateur video clip of Bianchi's crash, showing a marshal waving a <a href="Racing%20flags%23Green%20flag">green flag</a> at the crash site, was uploaded to social media. Four-time world champion <a href="Alain%20Prost">Alain Prost</a> said that the marshal should have moved away from the crash scene, but five-time <a href="24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> winner <a href="Emanuele%20Pirro">Emanuele Pirro</a> said that it was normal practice and anyone who said otherwise was "mistaken". According to several commentators, the marshal committed no infraction. Former driver and <a href="Sky%20Sports%20F1">Sky Sports F1</a> announcer <a href="Martin%20Brundle">Martin Brundle</a> called for recovery vehicles to be barred from driving on the track. Driver steward <a href="Mika%20Salo">Mika Salo</a> defended Whiting's decision not to deploy the safety car after Sutil's crash, and minimised claims that the race was stopped for intensifying rain. <a href="Rede%20Globo">Rede Globo</a> lead commentator <a href="Galv%C3%A3o%20Bueno">Galvão Bueno</a>, however, was vocal in his criticism of Whiting's decision, describing it as "the biggest mistake I've seen in 40 years in Formula One".

The FIA announced a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, to investigate the cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in <a href="Doha">Doha</a>. According to the report, there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded that it would have been impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the start time of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety commission chairman Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was unfeasible.

Hospitalised in Yokkaichi, Bianchi remained in a critical but stable condition on a <a href="medical%20ventilator">medical ventilator</a>. He was removed from his <a href="induced%20coma">induced coma</a> in November and began breathing unaided, enabling him to be transferred to the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (CHU) in <a href="Nice">Nice</a>. Bianchi remained unconscious in critical condition there, but his family were better able to visit. On 13 July 2015, Bianchi's father said that he was "less optimistic" about his son's chances because of the lack of significant progress and the length of time since the accident. Bianchi died four days later, aged 25, thus becoming the first <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20fatalities">Formula One driver to be killed</a> by injuries sustained during a Grand Prix since <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> in <a href="Death%20of%20Ayrton%20Senna">1994</a>. Bianchi's funeral, on 21 July at <a href="Nice%20Cathedral">Nice Cathedral</a>, was attended by members of the Formula One community.

The race result increased Hamilton's lead over Rosberg in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points. Ricciardo and Vettel maintained third and fourth place, and Alonso remained in fifth despite his retirement. Mercedes moved further ahead of Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, with a 180-point lead over the Austrian team. Williams increased their advantage over Ferrari in the battle for third, and Force India retained fifth place with four races left in the season.

History of Chincoteague, Virginia

The history of human activity in <a href="Chincoteague%2C%20Virginia">Chincoteague</a>, on the <a href="Eastern%20Shore%20of%20Virginia">Eastern Shore of Virginia</a>, begins with the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>. Until European settlers possessed the island in the late 17th century, the Chincoteague Indians used it as a place to gather shellfish, but are not known to have lived there; Chincoteague Island lacked suitable soil for their agriculture. The island's name derives from those early visitors: by one popular tale, "chincoteague" meant "Beautiful land across the water" in their language.

Use of Chincoteague Island by European settlers began in the 17th century, when the island was granted to a Virginia colonist. Legal disputes followed, and it was not until 1691 that title was determined by the courts. Although a few people were living on the island by 1700, it was primarily used as a place to graze livestock. This was probably the origin of the <a href="Chincoteague%20Pony">Chincoteague ponies</a>, <a href="feral%20horse">feral horse</a>s that long roamed in the area. They are no longer present in the wild on Chincoteague Island. During the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the islanders supported the new nation's bid for independence. The local fishing and seafood resources began to be systematically exploited in the early 19th century.

In the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, the islanders supported the Union despite being located in a seceded state, and the war touched Chincoteague only lightly. Oysters became a major industry in the postwar years. Chincoteague's relative isolation ended in 1876 with the arrival of the railroad at <a href="Franklin%20City%2C%20Virginia">Franklin City, Virginia</a>, across <a href="Chincoteague%20Bay">Chincoteague Bay</a> from the island, and the initiation of a dedicated steamboat service between the two settlements. Nevertheless, contemporary visitors found Chincoteague primitive. Part of the island was incorporated as the Town of Chincoteague within <a href="Accomack%20County%2C%20Virginia">Accomack County</a> in 1908; the municipality annexed the remainder of the island in 1989. Automobile traffic could reach the island with the completion of a causeway in 1922. Two devastating fires in that decade caused the establishment of the <a href="Chincoteague%20Fire%20Department">Chincoteague Fire Department</a> in 1925; the new volunteer company took over the traditional <a href="Pony%20Penning">pony penning</a>, and soon had ponies from nearby <a href="Assateague%20Island">Assateague Island</a> swim the <a href="Assateague%20Channel">narrow channel</a> between the two islands as part of that roundup. The carnival, pony swim, and subsequent auction constitute a highlight of the town's calendar, attracting tens of thousands to the island.

The seafood and poultry industries thrived through much of the 20th century, but neither is important to the island's economy today. Chincoteague is a major tourist destination on Virginia's Eastern Shore, with many coming to enjoy the beaches on Assateague Island. The success of <a href="Marguerite%20Henry">Marguerite Henry</a>'s 1947 children's book "<a href="Misty%20of%20Chincoteague">Misty of Chincoteague</a>" and its sequels helped publicize Chincoteague, as did the 1961 film, "<a href="Misty%20%28film%29">Misty</a>".

Chincoteague is the name of a <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Virginia">town</a>, and the <a href="barrier%20island">barrier island</a> on which it is located, on Virginia's <a href="Eastern%20Shore%20of%20Virginia">Eastern Shore</a>, in the United States. The island is about long and wide. Sand forms its soil, with a thin layer of loam above it away from the water, enough to support pine trees and grass. <a href="Chincoteague%20Inlet">Chincoteague Inlet</a>, a break in the barrier island system, occurs near Chincoteague Island, at the southern end of <a href="Assateague%20Island">Assateague Island</a>. Assateague shelters Chincoteague from the Atlantic and stretches north almost to <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City, Maryland</a>.

The local Native Americans, called by Europeans the Chincoteague Indians, did not in fact reside on Chincoteague Island itself, but lived on the mainland, where there was suitable land for hunting and agriculture. They lived near what was at first called Chincoteague Creek, on the mainland, and is today Little Mosquito Creek. The tribe moved to a new village site every few years, and visited Chincoteague Island to obtain shellfish. Although many references state that the name "Chincoteague" is the Native American word for "Beautiful land across the water", according to local historian Kirk Mariner, this legend is of 20th-century origin, invented to promote a song by that name by an islander. The name, he states, instead derives from the tribe's word for "large stream" or "inlet".

The Chincoteague Indians gradually withdrew northwards in the late 17th century as European colonization grew; most settled on a reservation at present-day <a href="Snow%20Hill%2C%20Maryland">Snow Hill, Maryland</a>, with allied tribes of Native Americans, though some may have remained in their traditional area. They were later forced from the reservation, and their descendants are among the <a href="Nanticoke%20people">Nanticoke people</a> in southern Delaware.

Although <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a> was settled in 1607 with the advent of the <a href="Jamestown%20Colony">Jamestown Colony</a>, it was not until 1680 that Europeans occupied Chincoteague Island. A <a href="land%20patent">patent</a> to Chincoteague Island had been granted by the British colonial authorities to Daniel Jenifer in 1671; that interest had been transferred to Thomas Welburn, husband of Jenifer's stepdaughter and prominent local merchant who lived on the mainland side of Chincoteague Bay. To fulfill the terms of the patent and gain title, the holder or his designee had to live on the land for a year—in the contemporary term, to "seat" the land. Welburn and several employees built a house there and cleared land for a small farm. His employee and tenant, Robert Scott, lived there only for the required year. Once it had expired, the house was abandoned, but Welburn, despite considering the land his own, did not register his efforts to perfect title.

Unaware that Welburn had seated the land, the authorities declared Chincoteague Island abandoned and issued another patent for the land in December 1684 to John Clayton, who conveyed it to Colonel William Kendall of <a href="Northampton%20County%2C%20Virginia">Northampton</a>. When Welburn learned that Kendall was planning to seat the land himself, he threatened to shoot trespassers on the island. Instead, Welburn sued, and the case dragged on in the <a href="Accomack%20County%2C%20Virginia">Accomack County</a> courts until the local justices transferred it to the General Court in the capital of <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a>. Welburn lost the case, as the General Court ruled in 1691 that as Jenifer had never lived on the island, he had not conveyed a valid patent to Welburn. Fresh patents were then issued, dividing the island between Kendall and another prominent citizen of Northampton, Major John Robins, with the dividing line near present-day Church Street.

Once ownership of the island was settled, it was used mostly as a place to house livestock, since there was no need for fences or other enclosures to prevent the animals from straying, and they could feed off of the marsh grasses. This usage was most likely the origin of <a href="Chincoteague%20pony">the ponies</a> that have made Chincoteague and Assateague Islands famous, though there are legends that the ponies' ancestors survived a shipwreck of a Spanish vessel. One such ship did run aground on Assateague Island in 1750, but according to John Amrhein Jr. in his account of his efforts to locate that vessel, "the mystery of the origin of the wild ponies became fused with the oldest memories of the Spanish shipwreck".

An early inhabitant was Henry Towles, who had seated the island for Kendall in 1686. He bought land from Kendall on the island, lived there, and sold it in 1709. The first permanent residents were likely George and Hannah Blake, originally tenants; their son John bought land from Kendall in the 1690s. Blake's Point, which extends out into Chincoteague Bay, testifies to their residence on the western side of the island. The will of John Robins, recorded in 1709, documents the presence of horses on Chincoteague—he bequeaths one, and mentions that his livestock were on the island. He also willed a "mallato <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="mulatto">mulatto</a> boy Charles son of Hannah, which said boy is now on my part of Jengoteague Island". Through the 18th century the population slowly expanded until by the end of it about 200 people, mostly tenant farmers and squatters, lived on Chincoteague and Assateague.

When the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> broke away from the British Crown in 1776, early decrees of the provisional <a href="Fifth%20Virginia%20Convention">Virginia Convention</a> affected Chincoteague. In May 1776, the body ordered that the coastal islands be stripped of livestock that might be taken by British ships. The islanders, in June, petitioned for a repeal or exemption, as they had, the petition stated, "the most fervent desire to do everything in their power to defeat the ... enemies of American liberty", as well as a militia of some forty men able to repel British raiders. The convention allowed Chincoteague and other islands along the Atlantic coast to retain their livestock.

In mid-1776, the convention voted to fortify Chincoteague's harbor—it was then being used by ships evading the British blockade of Chesapeake Bay. Smuggled goods were unloaded on the mainland, and taken down the Eastern Shore toward more populated areas. The resulting fort was built on <a href="Wallops%20Island">Wallops Island</a>, across the inlet from Chincoteague. The smuggling route maintained its importance as the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> continued, and in August 1779, the sole action in the area took place—a British privateer, pretending to be a smuggler, disabled the fort's guns and captured a cargo ship at anchor in Chincoteague Bay. Island legend holds that four men from Chincoteague fought for the Americans at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Battle of Yorktown</a> in October 1781, and that one was delayed in returning to the island because General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> had the soldier transport the <a href="war%20flag">battle flag</a> to the general's home at <a href="Mount%20Vernon">Mount Vernon</a>.

By 1800, the original large parcels of land on Chincoteague Island were being broken into plots of or larger. There were some 200 people living on Chincoteague or Assateague, but there were no stores or other retail enterprises. A school, unusual for Virginia's Eastern Shore at the time, was erected sometime before 1804. Three island families were free African-Americans; two other households had black servants or slaves. One of the free African-Americans, Ocraw Brinney, became a major island landowner. Born in Africa and transported by slave ship, he was freed in 1787 and was supposedly 130 years old when he died around 1840, but was more likely aged about 100. His holdings included what today are the Carnival Grounds, south of downtown Chincoteague.

In the first half of the 19th century, Chincoteague became a source of seafood. As the cities along the eastern seaboard, such as New York and Philadelphia, continued to expand, their local areas could not supply them with enough shellfish. Islanders saw the opportunity, and many abandoned agriculture, instead harvesting the sea. The villagers of Chincoteague petitioned the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> three times between 1833 and 1851 seeking the repeal of various fishing laws. The first post office was established in 1854, and the first doctor arrived four years later. By 1860 there were 150 families resident on Chincoteague, 126 oystermen on the island, and others belonging to allied trades. That year, a hotel was operating on the island, located in what today is the downtown area—in the mid-19th century, that part of the island developed as Chincoteague's commercial core.

The first accounts of pony penning are from an 1835 letter to the editor published in the "Farmer's Register" by Thompson Holmes of "Chincoteague"—that is, the mainland opposite the island, then also called by that name. According to his letter, few horses remained wild on Chincoteague Island, and residents would go over to Assateague to build temporary corrals to place the local herds in. Selected horses were <a href="livestock%20branding">branded</a>, <a href="gelding">gelded</a>, and sold. Holmes told about an earlier practice, to drive the horses directly into the water, which had been abandoned because too many had drowned. Holmes mourned that the pony pennings of his day were only "a shadow of their former glory". The pennings, the letter related, nevertheless attracted crowds from far and near.

The outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> in 1861 left Chincoteague residents with a stark choice. If they left the Union as Virginia sought to do, they might lose access to their seafood markets. Refusal to do so might isolate Chincoteague from the rest of its state. In the <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">referendum on secession</a> held in Virginia on May 23, 1861, Northampton County, in the southern Eastern Shore, voted unanimously for secession, and there was also a majority for leaving the Union in Accomack County. Nevertheless, the residents of Chincoteague, along with those on <a href="Tangier%20Island">Tangier Island</a> (part of Accomack) in the Chesapeake Bay, chose not to leave the Union, in Chincoteague's case by a vote of 134 or 135 to 1 or 2—sources differ as to the exact tally. Despite this lopsided tally, some from Chincoteague supported the South, or even fought for it.

Even before the vote, commerce between the North and Virginia had been forbidden by Union officials. Residents sent John A.M. Whealton, a merchant and staunch Union loyalist, to Philadelphia to seek the release of confiscated supplies. He was able to gain the support of local officials and sailed cautiously for home with the goods, aware that the permission of Philadelphia's mayor did not bind the U.S. Navy. He found the <a href="Assateague%20Light">Assateague Light</a>house extinguished by southern sympathizers and the bay again used for smuggling. In September, the <a href="USS%20Louisiana%20%281861%29">"USS Louisiana"</a>, an <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad</a>, arrived, with orders to secure the area against smugglers, and within days, one smuggler's ship was burned in the engagement known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cockle%20Creek">Battle of Cockle Creek</a>, and another captured two days later. The naval vessel received a warm welcome from the islanders, who promptly took oaths of allegiance to the Union. After a petition on behalf of 800 inhabitants of the island was passed up the chain of command, Secretary of the Navy <a href="Gideon%20Welles">Gideon Welles</a> granted the islanders the right to continue to engage in trade in November 1861, the same month the Eastern Shore was taken for the North with little bloodshed.

The "Louisiana" was sent away to more troubled waters in December 1861, arousing fears by the islanders that they would be abused by Confederate loyalists on the mainland. There were some incidents of this sort, but they ceased as the mainlanders adjusted to the military presence, and the war did not again come near Chincoteague. Union soldiers were stationed on Chincoteague Island for about four months in 1863 and 1864 to guard against a rumored attack on Assateague Lighthouse by sympathizers. Maryland militia were initially used, followed by a regiment of African-American soldiers, but in March 1864, they were removed and local men in the Eastern Shore Volunteers, formed in 1863 but not called into service until the following year, guarded the island and other local points.

The years after the Civil War brought prosperity to Chincoteague with expansion of the oyster trade. As the law required an oysterman to be a Virginia resident for a year before harvesting in Virginia waters, many in that trade bought lots along Main Street, running along the west side of the island, or across the bay in the new village of <a href="Greenbackville%2C%20Virginia">Greenbackville, Virginia</a>, just south of the Maryland line. Other new residents on the island were freed African-Americans, or Northerners who sought opportunities in the southern states. Chincoteague oysters, especially those from Tom's Cove at the southern point of the island, gained a reputation for taste, and, marketed across the country as "Chincoteague salt oysters", became famous.
In 1876, art student <a href="Howard%20Pyle">Howard Pyle</a> visited Chincoteague. He wrote of his experiences, including viewing the pony penning (which took place behind his hotel), the following year in "<a href="Scribner%27s%20Magazine">Scribner's Magazine</a>", accompanying the text with the first known contemporary drawings of the event. Pyle was struck by the quaintness of Chincoteague, describing it as "an enchanted island, cut loose from modern progress and left drifting some seventy-five years backward in the ocean of time". The publicity in a national magazine did nothing to reduce the crowds coming to Chincoteague for the penning.

The island's status as an isolated backwater began to end in 1876, when a rail line reached <a href="Franklin%20City%2C%20Virginia">Franklin City</a>, on the shores of the bay and only from Chincoteague Island, with a steamship supplying the remaining connection. This improvement gave oystermen an efficient means of getting their wares to market, and also brought early tourists to Chincoteague, seeking respite from the sweltering summers in the city.

Due to the popularity of oysters, Chincoteague continued to grow; commercial buildings were built along Main Street. In 1890, the island acquired its first barbershop, and about 500 barrels of shucked oysters were being sent to the mainland daily on the steamer. Gas illumination arrived by 1900, the first telephone exchange in 1902, and <a href="rural%20free%20delivery">rural free delivery</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">United States Post Office Department</a> in 1905. Although there were few shops or public buildings, there was a shoe store and a notary public. The roads were made of dirt, covered with sea shells.

In the early 20th century, according to Mariner, Chincoteague "was a curious mixture of the progressive and the primitive, of worldly-wise townsfolk and isolated country people". Beginning in about 1900, the residents sought to be incorporated as a <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Virginia">town</a>. Gaining a municipal charter from the General Assembly would allow ordinances to be passed to keep livestock off the streets without seeking redress from the state government in Richmond or the county government in <a href="Accomac%2C%20Virginia">Accomac</a>. In 1908, the legislature incorporated part of the island as the Town of Chincoteague, and on July 4, A. Frank Matthews became the first mayor.

The <a href="1910%20United%20States%20Census">1910 United States Census</a> showed a population of 3,295 for the island, of whom 1,419 lived in the town. Few resided in the interior of the island; most lived in single-family houses, facing the water across roads that ran just above the high tide line. The population of the island had increased to about 3,600 as of 1916; there were about 100 African-Americans, all of whom lived on the same part of the island. Most islanders of working age were part of or supported the seafood trade. At that time, most houses got their water from shallow-dug wells, located in many cases close by primitive privies. Water from such wells was also used to wash the oysters and to make ice to preserve them. Almost all Chincoteague oysters were sent out of state, and the federal <a href="United%20States%20Public%20Health%20Service">Public Health Service</a> intervened in 1916 to get the mayor and town council to order improved sanitation, with islanders living outside the town line agreeing to abide by the ordinances.
Although dwarfed in population by the neighboring island, Assateague was still populated by a few families. A penning was still held on Assateague along with one on Chincoteague, but the Assateague event was suspended after 1920 as the largest landowner refused to allow access. Beginning in 1923, the Assateague herd was transported to Chincoteague for a joint penning, most likely by boat, as the idea of swimming the ponies had not yet been adopted. The refusal of the Assateague landowner to allow islanders to cross his land made it difficult for them to get to work, and Assateague became depopulated, with most of the buildings disassembled and rebuilt on Chincoteague Island. Most of Assateague Island was sold to the federal government in 1943.

In 1919, John B. Whealton, Chincoteague-born though a Florida resident, persuaded the Virginia General Assembly to grant a charter to his Chincoteague Toll Road and Bridge Company to build <a href="John%20B.%20Whealton%20Memorial%20Causeway">a causeway from the mainland to the island</a>. Whealton submitted the winning bid to build the causeway as well as gaining the charter for his company to operate it. The road was originally a toll crossing, and early plans had it reaching the island south of downtown, near the site of today's Carnival Grounds, but Whealton persuaded the town council to have the terminal point be downtown, near the Atlantic Hotel, the island's largest. The road was close to completion when a major fire destroyed much of downtown, including the hotel, on February 5, 1920. There was then only a small, ill-equipped fire company in Chincoteague, and the fire was fought by men of the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">Coast Guard</a> from the stations near the island. The hotel was underinsured and not rebuilt, though others took its place, and the council took advantage of the disaster to straighten Main Street. The fire and poor weather in the winters of 1921 and 1922 delayed the causeway, which was officially opened on November 15, 1922 by Virginia Governor <a href="E.%20Lee%20Trinkle">E. Lee Trinkle</a>. Most vehicles on the first day wound up mired in mud once a downpour turned the causeway into a quagmire. Nevertheless, the causeway proved a success, and by year's end over 100 vehicles were crossing it on an average day. Water from mainland wells was piped along the causeway, allowing the town to offer running water.
The second devastating fire in four years destroyed much of downtown Chincoteague on February 25, 1924, and caused the town's leaders to conclude that a better-organized <a href="volunteer%20fire%20department">volunteer fire department</a> was needed to replace Chincoteague's fire brigade. The <a href="Chincoteague%20Fire%20Department">Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company</a> was founded in June 1925, though it needed much equipment, including a fire truck. To raise funds the fire company took over the 1925 Chincoteague pony penning, which had been declining, and sold some horses at fixed prices (auctioning began not later than 1932). Fifteen thousand people attended the penning and other festivities. The proceeds from the event were over $6,000, enabling the department to buy a pump truck. Public fascination with the pony swim, inaugurated that year at the narrowest point of the channel between the two islands, led to increased attendance in the following years. Except during the war years of 1943 and 1944, the carnival, pony swim and auction have occurred every year since.

By 1930, the year the causeway was purchased by the state and the toll removed, the Town of Chincoteague had a population of 2,130. In the 1930s, poultry farming became popular on the island, and by the 1950s, produced over a million birds per year. Although oystering was still a common occupation, the trade was increasingly regulated, causing much of the production and canning to be done by large companies, and many watermen turned to fishing, clamming, and crabbing. Others shot ducks and other waterfowl indigenous to the island. Locals carved <a href="duck%20decoy%20%28model%29">duck decoy</a>s to aid in the hunt; these remain a popular collectible and souvenir of the island.

In 1941, the United States entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; early the following year, the Germans torpedoed two merchant ships off the Assateague coast. To guard the coast, the United States Army established two small posts on Virginia's Eastern Shore, one each at Accomac and Chincoteague. The Navy established the Chincoteague Naval Auxiliary Air Station in 1943, across from Chincoteague on the mainland. One young pilot being trained there, future president <a href="George%20Herbert%20Walker%20Bush">George Herbert Walker Bush</a>, got in trouble for "buzzing" the house of a young woman he had met at a dance. The conclusion of the war, in 1945, brought celebrations in Chincoteague and the reinstatement of the annual July events, now held at the brand-new Carnival Grounds south of downtown.

In 1946, children's author <a href="Marguerite%20Henry">Marguerite Henry</a> came to Chincoteague for the summer, intending to write about the wild horses of Assateague and the pony penning and auction on Chincoteague Island. With her came illustrator <a href="Wesley%20Dennis%20%28illustrator%29">Wesley Dennis</a>, with whom she had previously worked, and who would take photographs to be converted to pen-and-ink drawings.

Staying at the <a href="bed%20and%20breakfast">bed and breakfast</a> of Miss Molly Rowley on Main Street, Henry encountered island horse breeder Clarence Beebe, visited his ranch on the southern portion of the island, and met his grandchildren Maureen and Paul. On the Beebe Ranch, Henry saw a young <a href="filly">filly</a> named Misty. Henry fell in love with the horse, and tried to persuade "Grandpa" Beebe to sell the filly, promising to include him and his grandchildren in her book. The breeder eventually agreed, on condition Misty remained on the Beebe Ranch until she was weaned, and that the animal was eventually returned to him from Henry's Illinois home for breeding. Henry made the purchase, and returned to the Midwest with an outline of her story. Several months later, Misty arrived by rail. In 1947, Henry's book "<a href="Misty%20of%20Chincoteague">Misty of Chincoteague</a>" was published, about the desire of the Beebe children to have a pony of their own—Misty, daughter of the untamable Phantom. The book became an immediate best seller, and the following year was designated as a <a href="Newbery%20Award">Newbery Honor Book</a> by the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a>. Following the book's appearance and success, a steady stream of articles on Chincoteague began to appear in national magazines.

Henry wrote a series of sequels, and hoped to interest the movies, but Hollywood was slow to reach out to the Eastern Shore. It was not until 1960 that filming of "<a href="Misty%20%28film%29">Misty</a>" began. Almost all of the motion picture was shot locally—though the Beebe Ranch was not used, with a property on the mainland substituted. The film premiered at a Hollywood cinema and at the Roxy Theatre in Chincoteague, with the first showings simultaneous. In a nod to Hollywood, the real-life horse Misty placed her hoof in wet cement outside the Roxy just before the movie ran.
Despite the new source of island fame, many young people left Chincoteague in the years after World War II. There was no beach on Chincoteague; in an effort to provide one for visitors and townsfolk, local promoters sought the construction of a bridge to Assateague Island, where there is a beach along the Atlantic shoreline. They were led by Wyle Maddox, a wealthy chicken farmer who had significant business interests on Chincoteague Island. First proposed around 1950, the bridge and roadway across Assateague, by then uninhabited and under federal jurisdiction, took over a decade to approve, and finally opened in September 1962. The bridge to Assateague is at the east end of Maddox Boulevard, that crosses Chincoteague Island north of downtown, and was developed by Wyle Maddox.

The town remained busy and prosperous in the postwar years, especially by the standards of the rural Eastern Shore, and the locals took pride in this—in the early 1950s, the town twice finished second in a competition for the cleanest community in America, and then won the award for its size classification in 1954 and 1955. Main Street was so crowded with cars that parking meters were installed. When oyster parasites and overfishing combined to devastate the oyster industry in the 1950s, clams became the island's major industry. The Burton Clamming Company promoted itself as the largest in the world, sending 1.3 million clams to market on a typical day in 1957.

The final delay in the completion of the Assateague bridge was caused by the <a href="Ash%20Wednesday%20Storm%20of%201962">Ash Wednesday Storm</a> of March 1962 that devastated both islands, as well as other points along the Atlantic Seaboard. Although no one died on Chincoteague, the storm flooded virtually all buildings on Chincoteague Island and wiped out the poultry industry—not only were an estimated quarter million birds killed, the buildings used in chicken farming were destroyed. An estimated 100 ponies were killed by the storm, both on Assateague Island and at the Beebe Ranch. Misty was pregnant with her third <a href="foal">foal</a>; the Beebes placed her in their kitchen before they were evacuated. Once the ranch could again be reached, Misty was taken to a farm on the mainland just over the Maryland line, where she gave birth to a filly, <a href="Stormy%2C%20Misty%27s%20Foal">Stormy</a>. The devastation of the storm brought national attention to Chincoteague, and Stormy's birth upstaged the visit of Virginia Governor <a href="Albertis%20S.%20Harrison">Albertis S. Harrison</a>. Many contributed to the recovery efforts, and Misty—both film and horse—was made available for special benefit showings.

Until the 1950s, most tourists to the island, except during the annual carnival and pony penning, were sportsmen, there to fish or hunt waterfowl. Publicity generated by the Misty franchise, and the easy access to the beach and recreational facilities on Assateague Island, brought many tourists to Chincoteague who were uninterested in shooting the wildlife except with cameras. Combined with the continued decline of the seafood industry, the economy of Chincoteague gradually shifted from being based on harvesting its waters to tourism.

Many souvenir shops and other tourist enterprises were built along Maddox Boulevard, especially in the years after 1962. At first, the motels were buildings converted from other uses, but by the late 1960s, purpose-built structures were being erected along Maddox Boulevard, some with swimming pools. Although Misty died in 1972 at age 26, the island continued to be publicized. By the 1990s, tourism was the island's principal business, bringing in more than $100 million annually. National hotel chains, including a <a href="Hampton%20Inn">Hampton Inn</a> and a <a href="Comfort%20Suites">Comfort Suites</a>, arrived with the 21st century.

The changes to Chincoteague, including the sale of the Beebe Ranch for development in 1989 and the destruction by fire of the ranch house in 1996, brought local soul-searching. Islanders were divided by such questions as the establishment of a nudist beach on Assateague (outlawed by Accomack County ordinance in 1984) and the building of a <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> near the bridge between the two islands. The modest homes on Chincoteague Island were supplemented by townhouses and condominiums, many occupied by seasonal residents. With increased real estate prices, many from Chincoteague sold their land and moved to less expensive property on the mainland. The seafood industry ceased to be a major factor in the island's economy: most of the oyster-shucking houses, which had continued in operation using imported shellfish despite the local decline in oystering, finally closed in the 1980s and 1990s. The clam industry sought bivalves from deeper waters, and Chincoteague by then supplied few shellfish.

In 1989, the town expanded, by agreement with the Accomack County government, bringing all of Chincoteague Island under town jurisdiction. Despite local opposition, the modest bridge between Chincoteague and Assateague was rebuilt into a four-lane structure in 2010, the better to accommodate the millions of annual visitors to Assateague. The causeway from the mainland was re-routed, moving the terminal point on Chincoteague Island to a point north of downtown, the intersection of Main Street and Maddox Boulevard. From there, visitors may proceed south to downtown and the Carnival Grounds, or east to the tourist strip along Maddox Boulevard and to the bridge to Assateague Island. The tourist stores on Maddox Boulevard sell souvenirs, local artwork, the necessities for a day at the beach, and pony-related T-shirts and books. As of 2009, the average foal at the auction sold for $1,344. Between 60 and 80 are sold annually; the auction helps keep the herd at a sustainable population of 150.

SMS "Emden" ("His Majesty's Ship "Emden"") was the second and final member of the of <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> ("Kaiserliche Marine"). Named for the town of <a href="Emden">Emden</a>, she was laid down at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Danzig">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Dockyard) in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> in 1906. Her hull was launched in May 1908, and completed in July 1909. She had one sister ship, . Like the preceding cruisers, "Emden" was armed with ten guns and two <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s.

"Emden" spent the majority of her career overseas in the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">German East Asia Squadron</a>, based in <a href="Qingdao">Tsingtao</a>, in the <a href="Kiautschou%20Bay%20concession">Kiautschou Bay concession</a> in China. In 1913, she came under the command of <a href="Karl%20von%20M%C3%BCller">Karl von Müller</a>, who would captain the ship during World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, "Emden" captured a Russian <a href="steamship">steamer</a> and converted her into the <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a> . "Emden" rejoined the East Asia Squadron, after which she was detached for independent raiding in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. The cruiser spent nearly two months operating in the region, and captured nearly two dozen ships. On October 28, 1914, "Emden" launched a surprise attack on <a href="Penang">Penang</a>; in the resulting <a href="Battle%20of%20Penang">Battle of Penang</a>, she sank the Russian cruiser and the French <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> .

Müller then took "Emden" to raid the <a href="Cocos%20Islands">Cocos Islands</a>, where he landed a contingent of sailors to destroy British facilities. There, "Emden" was attacked by the Australian cruiser on 9 November 1914. The more powerful Australian ship quickly inflicted serious damage and forced Müller to <a href="Beaching%20%28nautical%29">run his ship aground</a> to prevent her from sinking. Out of a crew of 376, 133 were killed in the battle. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner; the landing party, led by <a href="Hellmuth%20von%20M%C3%BCcke">Hellmuth von Mücke</a>, commandeered an old <a href="schooner">schooner</a> and eventually returned to Germany. "Emden"s wreck was quickly destroyed by wave action, and was broken up for scrap in the 1950s.

"Emden" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. She displaced at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">triple-expansion steam engines</a>, designed to give for a top speed of . The engines were powered by twelve coal-fired Marine-type <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s and drove a pair of <a href="screw%20propeller">screw propeller</a>s. "Emden" carried up to of coal, which gave her a range of at . She had a crew of 18 officers and 343 enlisted men. "Emden" was the last German cruiser to be equipped with triple-expansion engines; all subsequent cruisers used the more powerful <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s.

The ship was armed with ten <a href="10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">10.5 cm SK L/40 guns</a> in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She carried a secondary battery of eight <a href="5.2%20cm%20SK%20L/55%20naval%20gun">SK L/55 guns</a>, also in single mounts. She was also equipped with two <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s with four <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es, mounted in the hull below the waterline. She was also fitted to carry fifty <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to thick. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick shields.

The contract for "Emden", ordered as "<a href="ersatz">ersatz</a>" (replacement) , was placed on 6 April 1906 at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Danzig">Kaiserliche Werft</a> (Imperial Dockyard) in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> (now <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>, Poland). Her keel was laid down on 1 November 1906. She was launched on 26 May 1908 and christened by the "<a href="Lord%20Mayor">Oberbürgermeister</a>" (Lord Mayor) of her namesake city, Dr. <a href="Leo%20F%C3%BCrbringer">Leo Fürbringer</a>. After <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> work was completed by 10 July 1909, she was commissioned into the fleet. The new cruiser began her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s that day; they were interrupted from 11 August to 5 September when she participated in the annual autumn maneuvers of the main fleet. During this period, she also served as the escort for <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> aboard his yacht <a href="SMY%20Hohenzollern">"Hohenzollern"</a>. "Emden" was decommissioned in September after she completed her trials.

On 1 April 1910 "Emden" was reactivated and assigned to the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">"Ostasiengeschwader"</a> (East Asia Squadron), based at <a href="Qingdao">Tsingtao</a> in Germany's <a href="Jiaozhou%20Bay%20concession">Kiautschou concession</a> in China. The concession had been seized in 1897 in retaliation for the murder of German nationals in the area. "Emden" left <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> on 12 April 1910, bound for Asia by way of a goodwill tour of South America. A month later, on 12 May, she stopped in <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> and met with the cruiser , which was assigned to the "Ostamerikanischen" (East American) Station. "Emden" and "Bremen" stayed in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> from 17 to 30 May to represent Germany at the celebrations of the hundredth anniversary of Argentinian independence. The two ships then rounded <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>; "Emden" stopped in <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a>, Chile, while "Bremen" continued on to Peru.

The cruise across the Pacific was delayed because of a lack of good quality coal. "Emden" eventually took on around of coal at the Chilean naval base at <a href="Talcahuano">Talcahuano</a> and departed on 24 June. The cruise was used to evaluate the ship on long-distance voyages for use in future light cruiser designs. "Emden" encountered unusually severe weather on the trip, which included a stop at <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>. She anchored at <a href="Papeete">Papeete</a>, <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> to coal on 12 July, her bunkers nearly empty after crossing . The ship then proceeded to <a href="Apia">Apia</a> in <a href="German%20Samoa">German Samoa</a>, arriving on 22 July. There, she met the rest of the East Asia Squadron, commanded by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Erich%20G%C3%BChler">Erich Gühler</a>. The squadron remained in Samoa until October, when the ships returned to their base at Tsingtao. "Emden" was thereafter sent to the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a> from 27 October to 19 November, which included a visit to <a href="Hankou">Hankou</a>. The ship visited <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, Japan, before returning to Tsingtao on 22 December for her annual refit. The repair work was not carried out, since the <a href="Sokehs%20Rebellion">Sokehs Rebellion</a> erupted on <a href="Pohnpei">Ponape</a> in the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Carolines</a>, which required "Emden"s presence; she departed Tsingtao on 28 December, and left Hong Kong to join her.
The two cruisers reinforced German forces at Ponape, which included the old <a href="unprotected%20cruiser">unprotected cruiser</a> . The ships bombarded rebel positions and sent a landing force, which included men from the ships along with colonial police troops, ashore in mid-January 1911. By the end of February the revolt had been suppressed, and on 26 February the unprotected cruiser arrived to take over the German presence in the Carolines. "Emden" and the other ships held a funeral the following day for those killed in the operation, before departing on 1 March for Tsingtao via Guam. After arriving on 19 March, she finally began her yearly overhaul. In mid-1911, the ship went on a cruise to Japan; while there she accidentally rammed a Japanese steamer during a <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a>. The collision caused significant damage and necessitated another trip to the drydock in Tsingtao. She thereafter returned to the Yangtze to protect Europeans during the <a href="Xinhai%20Revolution">Chinese Revolution</a> that broke out on 10 October. In November, "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Maximilian von Spee</a> replaced Gühler as the commander of the East Asia Squadron.

At the end of the year, "Emden" won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the East Asia Squadron. In early December, "Emden" steamed to <a href="Incheon">Incheon</a> to assist the grounded German steamer "Deike Rickmers". In May 1913, "<a href="Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n">Korvettenkapitän</a>" (Lieutenant Commander) <a href="Karl%20von%20M%C3%BCller">Karl von Müller</a> became the ship's commanding officer; he was shortly thereafter promoted to "<a href="Fregattenkapit%C3%A4n">Fregattenkapitän</a>" (Commander). In mid-June, "Emden" went on a cruise to the German colonies in the Central Pacific, after which she was stationed off <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>, as fighting between Qing and revolutionary forces raged there. During this period, on 26 August, rebels attacked the ship, and "Emden"s gunners immediately returned fire, silencing her attackers. "Emden" moved to <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> on 14 August.

"Emden" spent the first half of 1914 on the normal routine of cruises in Chinese and Japanese waters without incident. During the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a> that followed the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a>, "Emden" was the only German cruiser in Tsingtao; Spee's two <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s, and , were cruising in the South Pacific and was en route to replace "Nürnberg" off the coast of Mexico. On 31 July, with war days away, Müller decided to put to sea to begin commerce raiding once war had been formally declared. Two days later, on 2 August, Germany declared war on Russia, and the following day, "Emden" captured the Russian steamer "Ryazan". The Russian vessel was sent back to Tsingtao, where she was converted into the <a href="auxiliary%20cruiser">auxiliary cruiser</a> .

On 5 August, Spee ordered Müller to join him at <a href="Pagan%20%28island%29">Pagan Island</a> in the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>; "Emden" left Tsingtao the following day along with the auxiliary cruiser <a href="SS%20Prinz%20Eitel%20Friedrich%20%281904%29">"Prinz Eitel Friedrich"</a> and the <a href="collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a> . The ships arrived in Pagan on 12 August. The next day, Spee learned that Japan would enter the war on the side of the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Triple Entente</a> and had dispatched a fleet to track his squadron down. Spee therefore decided to take the East Asia Squadron to South America, where it could attempt to break through to Germany, harassing British merchant traffic along the way. Müller suggested that one cruiser be detached for independent operations in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, since the squadron would be unable to attack British shipping while it was crossing the Pacific. Spee agreed, and allowed Müller to operate independently, since "Emden" was the fastest cruiser in the squadron.

On 14 August, "Emden" and "Markomannia" left the company of the East Asia Squadron, bound for the Indian Ocean. Since the cruiser was already operating in the western Indian Ocean around the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a>, Müller decided he should cruise in the shipping lanes between <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a> and <a href="Aden">Aden</a>. "Emden" steamed toward the Indian Ocean by way of the <a href="Molucca%20Sea">Molucca</a> and <a href="Banda%20Sea">Banda Sea</a>s. While seeking to coal off <a href="Tanah%20Jampea">Jampea Island</a>, the Dutch <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> <a href="HNLMS%20Maarten%20Harpertszoon%20Tromp">"Tromp"</a> stopped "Emden" and made clear that she would enforce Dutch neutrality. Müller therefore decided to steam into the <a href="Lombok%20Strait">Lombok Strait</a>. There, "Emden"s radio-intercept officers picked up messages from the British armored cruiser . To maintain secrecy, "Emden"s crew rigged up a dummy funnel to give her the appearance of a British light cruiser. She then steamed up the coast of <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> toward the Indian Ocean.

On 5 September, "Emden" entered the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>, achieving complete surprise, since the British assumed she was still with Spee's squadron. She operated on shipping routes there without success, until 10 September, when she moved to the Colombo–<a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> route. There, she captured the Greek collier "Pontoporros", which was carrying equipment for the British. Müller took the ship into his service and agreed to pay the crew. "Emden" captured five more ships; troop transports "Indus" and "Lovat" and two other ships were sunk, and the fifth, a steamer named "Kabinga", was used to carry the crews from the other vessels. On 13 September, Müller released "Kabinga" and sank two more British <a href="Prize%20%28law%29">prizes</a>. Off the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> estuary, "Emden" caught a Norwegian merchantman; upon searching her, the Germans determined she was not carrying <a href="contraband">contraband</a> and therefore released her. The Norwegians informed Müller that Entente warships were operating in the area, and so he decided to return to the eastern coast of India.

"Emden" thereafter stopped and released an Italian freighter, whose crew relayed news of the incident to a British vessel, which in turn informed British naval authorities in the region. The result was an immediate cessation of shipping and the institution of a <a href="Blackout%20%28wartime%29">blackout</a>. <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Martyn%20Jerram">Martyn Jerram</a> ordered "Hampshire", , and the Japanese <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> to search for "Emden". The British armored cruiser and the Japanese armored cruiser were sent to patrol likely coaling stations.
In late September, Müller decided to <a href="bombardment%20of%20Madras">bombard Madras</a>. Müller believed the attack would demonstrate his freedom of maneuver and decrease British prestige with the local population. At around 20:00 on 22 September, "Emden" entered the port, which was completely illuminated, despite the blackout order. "Emden" closed to within from the piers before she opened fire. She set fire to two <a href="oil%20tank">oil tank</a>s and damaged three others, and damaged a merchant ship in the harbor. In the course of the bombardment, "Emden" had fired 130 rounds. The following day, the British again mandated that shipping stop in the Bay of Bengal; during the first month of "Emden"s raiding career in the Indian Ocean, the value of exports there had fallen by 61.2 percent.

From Madras, Müller had originally intended to rendezvous with his colliers off <a href="Simalur%20Island">Simalur Island</a> in Indonesia, but instead decided to make a foray to the western side of Ceylon. On 25 September, "Emden" sank the British merchantmen "Tywerse" and "King Lund" two days before capturing the collier "Buresk", which was carrying a cargo of high-grade coal. A German <a href="prize%20crew">prize crew</a> went aboard "Buresk" and she was thereafter used to support "Emden"s operations. Later that day, the German raider sank the British vessels "Ryberia" and "Foyle". Low on fuel, "Emden" proceeded to the <a href="Maldives">Maldives</a> to coal. She arrived there on 29 September and remained for a day while her crew replenished her coal stocks. The raider then cruised the routes between Aden and Australia and between Calcutta and <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> for two days without success. "Emden" thereafter steamed to <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a> for engine maintenance and to rest her crew.

The British garrison at Diego Garcia had not yet learned of the state of war between Britain and Germany, and so treated "Emden" to a warm reception. She remained there until 10 October, during which time her bottom was cleaned of <a href="fouling">fouling</a>. She then resumed searching for merchant ships in the area west of Colombo. While operating there, "Emden" picked up "Hampshire"s wireless signals again, and so departed for the <a href="Chagos%20Archipelago">Chagos Archipelago</a> on 13 October. Meanwhile, the British had captured "Markomannia" on 12 October, depriving "Emden" of one of her colliers. On 15 October, "Emden" captured the British steamer "Benmore" off <a href="Minicoy">Minikoi</a> and sank her the next day. Over the next five days, she captured "Troiens", "Exfort", "Graycefale", "Sankt Eckbert", and "Chilkana". One was used as a collier, three were sunk, and the fifth was sent to port with the crews of the other vessels. On 20 October, Müller decided it was time to move to a new area of operations.

Müller decided his next course of action would be a surprise attack on <a href="Penang">Penang</a> in <a href="British%20Malaya">British Malaya</a>. "Emden" coaled in the <a href="Nicobar%20Islands">Nicobar Islands</a> and departed for Penang on the night of 27 October, with the departure timed to allow her to arrive off the harbor at dawn. She approached the harbor entrance at 03:00 on 28 October, steaming at a speed of , with her fourth dummy funnel erected to disguise her identity. "Emden"s lookouts quickly spotted a warship in the port with her lights on; it turned out to be the Russian protected cruiser , a veteran of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a>. "Zhemchug" had put into Penang for repairs to her boilers; only one was in service, which meant that she could not get under way, nor were her ammunition hoists powered. Only five rounds of ready ammunition were permitted for each gun, with a sixth chambered. "Emden" pulled alongside "Zhemchug" at a distance of ; Müller ordered a torpedo to be fired at the Russian cruiser. Immediately thereafter, he gave the order for the 10.5 cm guns to open fire.

"Emden" quickly inflicted grievous damage on her adversary; she turned around to make another pass at "Zhemchug". One of the Russian gun crews managed to get their weapon into action, but scored no hits. Müller ordered a second torpedo to be fired into the burning "Zhemchug" while his guns continued to batter her. The second torpedo caused a tremendous explosion that tore the ship apart. By the time the smoke cleared, "Zhemchug" had already slipped beneath the waves, her masts the only parts of the ship still above water. The destruction of "Zhemchug" killed 81 Russian sailors and wounded 129, of whom seven later died of their injuries. The elderly French cruiser and the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> opened wildly inaccurate fire on "Emden".

Müller then decided to depart, owing to the risk of encountering superior warships. Upon leaving the harbor, he encountered a British freighter, , loaded with ammunition, that had already stopped to pick up a <a href="maritime%20pilot">harbor pilot</a>. While preparing to take possession of the ship, "Emden" had to recall her boats when she spotted an approaching ship. This proved to be the French destroyer , and the unprepared ship was quickly destroyed. "Emden" stopped to pick up survivors from "Mousquet" and departed at around 08:00 as the other French ships were raising steam in preparation to get underway. One officer and thirty-five sailors were plucked from the water. Another French destroyer tried to follow, but lost sight of the German raider in a rainstorm. On 30 October, "Emden" stopped the British steamer "Newburn" and put the French sailors aboard her after they signed statements promising not to return to the war. The attack on Penang was a significant shock to the Entente powers, and caused them to delay the large convoys from Australia, since they would need more powerful escorts.

After releasing the British steamer, "Emden" turned south to Simalur, where she met the captured collier "Buresk". Müller then decided to attack the British coaling station in the <a href="Cocos%20Islands">Cocos Islands</a>; he intended to destroy the wireless station there and draw away British forces searching for him in the Indian Ocean. While en route to the Cocos, "Emden" spent two days combing the <a href="Sunda%20Strait">Sunda Strait</a> for merchant shipping without success. She thereafter proceeded to the Cocos, arriving off <a href="Direction%20Island%20%28Cocos%20%28Keeling%29%20Islands%29">Direction Island</a> at 06:00 on the morning of 9 November. Since there were no British vessels in the area, Müller sent ashore a landing party led by "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant">Kapitänleutnant</a>" (First Lieutenant) <a href="Hellmuth%20von%20M%C3%BCcke">Hellmuth von Mücke</a>, "Emden"s <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a>. The party consisted of another two officers, six non-commissioned officers, and thirty-eight sailors armed with four machine guns and thirty rifles.

"Emden" was using <a href="Radio%20jamming">jamming</a>, but the British wireless station was able to transmit the message "Unidentified ship off entrance." The message was received by the Australian light cruiser , which was away, escorting a convoy. "Sydney" immediately headed for the Cocos Islands at top speed. "Emden" picked up wireless messages from the then unidentified vessel approaching, but believed her to be away, giving them much more time than they actually had. At 09:00, lookouts aboard "Emden" spotted a smoke cloud on the horizon, and thirty minutes later identified it as a warship approaching at high speed. Mücke's landing party was still ashore, and there was no time left to recover them.

"Sydney" closed to a distance of before turning to a parallel course with "Emden". The German cruiser opened fire first, and <a href="%3Awikt%3Astraddle">straddled</a> the Australian vessel with her third salvo. "Emden"s gunners were firing rapidly, with a salvo every ten seconds; Müller hoped to overwhelm "Sydney" with a barrage of shells before her heavier armament could take effect. Two shells hit "Sydney", one of which disabled the aft fire control station; the other failed to explode. It took slightly longer for "Sydney" to find the range, and in the meantime, "Emden" turned toward her opponent in an attempt to close to torpedo range. "Sydney"s more powerful guns soon found the range and inflicted serious damage. The wireless compartment was destroyed and the crew for one of the forward guns was killed early in the engagement. At 09:45, Müller turned his ship toward "Sydney" in another attempt to reach a torpedo firing position. Five minutes later, a shell hit disabled the steering gear, and other fragments jammed the hand steering equipment. "Emden" could only be steered with her propellers. "Sydney"s gunfire also destroyed the <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s and caused heavy casualties amongst "Emden"s gun crews.

Müller made a third attempt to close to torpedo range, but "Sydney" quickly turned away. Shortly after 10:00, a shell from "Sydney" detonated ready ammunition near the starboard No. 4 gun and started a serious fire. A fourth and final attempt to launch a torpedo attack was made shortly thereafter, but "Sydney" was able to keep the range open. By 10:45, "Emden"s guns had largely gone silent; her <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> had been shredded and the two rear-most funnels had been shot away, along with the foremast. Müller realized that his ship was no longer able to fight, and so he decided to beach "Emden" on <a href="North%20Keeling%20Island">North Keeling Island</a> to save the lives of his crew. At 11:15, "Emden" was run onto the reef, and her engines and boilers were flooded. Her <a href="breech%20block">breech block</a>s and torpedo aiming gear were thrown overboard to render the weapons unusable, and all signal books and secret papers were burned. "Sydney" turned to capture the collier "Buresk", whose crew scuttled her when the Australian cruiser approached. "Sydney" then returned to the wrecked "Emden" and inquired if she surrendered. The signal books had been destroyed by fire and so the Germans could not reply, and since her flag was still flying, "Sydney" resumed fire. The Germans quickly raised <a href="white%20flag">white flag</a>s and the Australians ceased fire.

In the course of the action, "Emden" scored sixteen hits on "Sydney", killing three of her crew and wounding another thirteen. A fourth crewman died later from his injuries. "Sydney" had meanwhile fired some 670 rounds of ammunition, with around 100 hits claimed. "Emden" had suffered much higher casualties: 133 officers and enlisted men died, out of a crew of 376. Most of her surviving crew, including Müller, were taken into captivity the following day. The wounded men were sent to Australia, while the uninjured were interned at a camp in <a href="Malta">Malta</a>; the men were returned to Germany in 1920. Mücke's landing party evaded capture. They had observed the battle, and realized that "Emden" would be destroyed. Mücke therefore ordered the old <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "<a href="Ayesha%20%28ship%29">Ayesha</a>" to be prepared for sailing. The Germans departed before "Sydney" reached Direction Island, and sailed to <a href="Padang">Padang</a> in the Dutch East Indies. From there, they traveled to <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>, which was then part of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, an ally of Germany. They then traveled overland to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, arriving in June 1915. There, they reported to "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Wilhelm%20Souchon">Wilhelm Souchon</a>, the commander of the ex-German <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> . In the meantime, the British <a href="sloop">sloop</a> arrived at the Cocos Islands about a week after the battle to bury the sailors killed in the battle.

Over a raiding career spanning three months and , "Emden" had destroyed two Entente warships and sank or captured sixteen British steamers and one Russian merchant ship, totaling . Another four British ships were captured and released, and one British and one Greek ship were used as colliers. In 1915, a Japanese company proposed that "Emden" be repaired and refloated, but an inspection by the elderly <a href="flat-iron%20gunboat">flat-iron gunboat</a> concluded that wave damage to "Emden" made such an operation unfeasible. By 1919, there were reports that the wreck had almost completely broken up and disappeared beneath the waves. The wreck was eventually broken up "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>" in the early 1950s by a Japanese <a href="marine%20salvage">salvage</a> company; parts of the ship remain scattered around the area.

Following the destruction of "Emden", Kaiser Wilhelm II awarded the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> to the ship and announced that a new would be built to honor the original cruiser. Wilhelm II ordered that the new cruiser wear a large Iron Cross on her bow to commemorate her namesake ship. The third cruiser to bear the name , built in the 1920s for the "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>", also carried the Iron Cross, along with <a href="battle%20honor">battle honor</a>s for the Indian Ocean, Penang, Cocos Islands, and <a href="Saaremaa">Ösel</a>, where the second "Emden" had engaged several Russian destroyers and torpedo boats. Two further vessels have been named for the cruiser in the West German "<a href="Bundesmarine">Bundesmarine</a>": the laid down in 1959, and the laid down in 1979.

Three of the ship's 10.5 cm guns were removed from the wreck three years after the battle. One is preserved in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park</a> in Sydney, a second is located at the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy%20Heritage%20Centre">Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre</a> in , the main naval base in Sydney, and the third is on display at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. In addition, "Emden"s <a href="Ship%27s%20bell">bell</a> and stern ornament were recovered from the wreck and both are currently in the collection of the Australian War Memorial. A number of other artifacts, including a damaged 10.5 cm shell case, an iron <a href="rivet">rivet</a> from the hull, and uniforms were also recovered and are held in the Australian War Memorial.

A number of films have been made about "Emden"s wartime exploits, including the 1915 movies "<a href="How%20We%20Beat%20the%20Emden">How We Beat the Emden</a>" and "<a href="How%20We%20Fought%20the%20Emden">How We Fought the Emden</a>" and the 1928 "<a href="The%20Exploits%20of%20the%20Emden">The Exploits of the Emden</a>", all produced in Australia. German films include the 1926 <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> <a href="Our%20Emden">"Unsere Emden"</a>, footage from which was incorporated in <a href="Cruiser%20Emden">"Kreuzer Emden"</a> of 1932, and "<a href="Heldentum%20und%20Todeskampf%20unserer%20Emden">Heldentum und Todeskampf unserer Emden</a>", produced in 1934. All three films were directed by <a href="Louis%20Ralph">Louis Ralph</a>. More recently, in 2012, "<a href="Die%20M%C3%A4nner%20der%20Emden">Die Männer der Emden</a>" (The men of the "Emden") was released, which was made about how the crew of "Emden" made their way back to Germany after the Battle of Cocos.

After the bombardment of Madras, "Emden"s name, as "Amdan", entered the <a href="Sinhala%20language">Sinhala</a> and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> languages meaning "someone who is tough, manipulative and crafty." In the <a href="Malayalam%20language">Malayalam language</a> the word "Emadan" means "a big and powerful thing" or "as big as Emden".

Yugoslav submarine Nebojša

The Yugoslav submarine "Nebojša" was the second of the <a href="Hrabri-class%20submarine">"Hrabri"-class</a> <a href="diesel-electric">diesel-electric</a> <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s built by the <a href="Vickers-Armstrongs">Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard</a> on the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, for the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later Yugoslavia) and was <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> in 1927. Her design was based on that of the <a href="British%20L-class%20submarine">British L-class submarine</a> of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and she was built using parts originally assembled for a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> L-class submarine that was never built. She was armed with six bow-mounted <a href="torpedo%20tubes">torpedo tubes</a>, two guns and one <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>, and could dive to .

Prior to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> "Nebojša" participated in cruises to several <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> ports. During the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, she evaded capture by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian forces</a>, and joined British naval forces in the Mediterranean where she performed a training role. After the war she was taken over by the new Yugoslav government and renamed Tara. She was eventually <a href="Ship%20commissioning%23Ship%20decommissioning">stricken</a> in 1954, and <a href="Ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> in 1958.

Yugoslav naval policy in the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a> lacked direction until the mid-1920s, although it was generally accepted that the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s, coastal <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s and conventional <a href="bomber">bomber</a> aircraft to perform this role. The <a href="Hrabri-class%20submarine">"Hrabri"-class</a> submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.

"Nebojša" (Fearless) was built in 1927 for the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later Yugoslavia), by the <a href="Vickers-Armstrongs">Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard</a> on the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a> in the United Kingdom. Her design was based on that of the <a href="British%20L-class%20submarine">British L-class submarine</a> of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and she was built using parts originally assembled for HMS "L-68", which was never completed. Along with her <a href="sister%20ship">sister submarine</a> "<a href="Yugoslav%20submarine%20Hrabri">Hrabri</a>", she had an <a href="Length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a surfaced <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . Her surfaced <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a> was or submerged, and her crew consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men. She had an operational depth of .

The "Hrabri"-class had two shafts driven by two <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>s (when surfaced) or two electric motors (when submerged). Their diesel engines were rated at and the electric motors at , and they were designed to reach a top speed of under diesel power while surfaced, and on their electric motors when submerged. They were armed with six bow-mounted <a href="British%2021%20inch%20torpedo"></a> <a href="torpedo%20tubes">torpedo tubes</a>, and carried twelve torpedoes. They were also equipped with two <a href="QF%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20IV%2C%20XII%2C%20XXII"></a> <a href="deck%20gun">deck gun</a>s (one forward and one <a href="aft">aft</a> of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>), and one <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>. Their radius of action was at .

"Nebojša" was <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> in 1927 as the second submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a>. Along with her sister submarine "Hrabri", she left the Tyne in late January 1928. In company with the Yugoslav <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a> , the two submarines arrived in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bay of Kotor</a> on the southern <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> coast on 8 April 1928. In May and June 1929, "Hrabri", "Nebojša", "Hvar" and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser "<a href="SMS%20Niobe">Dalmacija</a>" on a cruise to <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Malta">Malta</a>, the Greek island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> in the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, and <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a> in the <a href="French%20protectorate%20of%20Tunisia">French protectorate of Tunisia</a>. The British naval <a href="attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> observed that the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. On 16 May 1930, "Nebojša" was exercising her crew at periscope depth near the entrance to the Bay of Kotor when she collided with a Yugoslav <a href="steamship">steamship</a>. The damage was not serious and there were no injuries, but her forward 102 mm gun was lost overboard. The necessary repairs were carried out at the dockyard in the Bay of Kotor.

In June and July 1930, "Hrabri", "Nebojša" and the fleet auxiliary "Sitnica" again cruised the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>, visiting <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. In September 1933, "Nebojša" and the submarine <a href="Yugoslav%20submarine%20Osvetnik">"Osvetnik"</a> cruised the southern part of the central Mediterranean. In August 1936, "Nebojša" and "Osvetnik" visited the Greek island of Corfu.

During the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, she and two <a href="Orjen-class%20torpedo%20boat">"Orjen"-class</a> <a href="motor%20torpedo%20boat">motor torpedo boat</a>s evaded capture by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian forces</a> at the Bay of Kotor, arriving at <a href="Souda%20Bay">Suda Bay</a>, <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, on 23 April, after eight days at sea. Despite this, the Italians claimed that they had sunk all the Yugoslav vessels. "Nebojša" then sailed to Alexandria, but the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> considered her unfit for combat duties. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> suggested her crew might be retrained and used to operate the recently captured German <a href="German%20Type%20VII%20submarine%23Type%20VIIC">Type VIIC U-boat</a> "<a href="HMS%20Graph">U-570</a>", but this idea was soon abandoned. She was based at <a href="Valletta">Valletta</a> in Malta as an <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a> training vessel, serving with the <a href="British%202nd%20Submarine%20Flotilla">British 2nd Submarine Flotilla</a> in 1942 and the <a href="British%203rd%20Submarine%20Flotilla">British 3rd Submarine Flotilla</a> in 1943. She continued working in the Mediterranean until the end of the war, but her service with the Royal Navy appears to have been limited to a training role.

After the war she was towed first to <a href="Bari">Bari</a> in Italy, then in August 1945 to the port of <a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split</a> where she was overhauled, renamed "Tara" and given the <a href="pennant%20number">pennant number</a> 801. She was then transferred to <a href="Pula">Pula</a> on the <a href="Istria">Istria</a>n peninsula in the northern Adriatic. Used to train the fledgling <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> submarine arm, she was <a href="Ship%20commissioning%23Ship%20decommissioning">stricken</a> in 1954. One of her guns was removed at the end of her career, and she was eventually <a href="Ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> in 1958.

In 2011, to mark the 70th anniversary of the invasion of Yugoslavia, the <a href="Military%20Museum%20%28Belgrade%29">Military Museum</a> in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> hosted an exhibit which included a flag from the "Nebojša". In April 2013, the 85th anniversary of the arrival of the first Yugoslav submarines at the Bay of Kotor was marked by an event in <a href="Tivat">Tivat</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, attended by dozens of former Yugoslav submariners.

<doc id="40838129" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40838129" title="Orel Hershiser's scoreless innings streak">
Orel Hershiser's scoreless innings streak

During the 1988 <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> season, <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> <a href="Orel%20Hershiser">Orel Hershiser</a> of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> set the MLB record for consecutive scoreless <a href="innings%20pitched">innings pitched</a>. Over 59 consecutive innings, opposing hitters did not score a <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">run</a> against Hershiser. During the streak, he averted numerous high-risk scoring situations. The streak spanned from the sixth inning of an August 30 game against the <a href="1988%20Montreal%20Expos%20season">Montreal Expos</a> to the tenth inning of a September 28 game against the <a href="1988%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season">San Diego Padres</a>. The previous record of innings was set by former Dodger pitcher <a href="Don%20Drysdale">Don Drysdale</a> in 1968; as the team's radio announcer, Drysdale called Hershiser's streak as he pursued the new record. Pundits have described the streak as among the greatest individual feats in sports and among the greatest records in baseball history.

During the streak, the <a href="Elias%20Sports%20Bureau">Elias Sports Bureau</a> changed its criteria for the official consecutive scoreless innings record for <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a>s from including fractional innings in which one or two <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">outs</a> had been recorded to counting only complete scoreless innings. Since the streak was active at the end of the 1988 season, it would have spanned two separate seasons if Hershiser had pitched any additional scoreless innings to begin the next year. However, he yielded a run in his first inning of work in the 1989 season against the <a href="1989%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a>, thus ending the streak. The streak only includes innings pitched in the regular season, excluding eight scoreless innings Hershiser pitched to start Game 1 of the <a href="1988%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">1988 National League Championship Series</a> on October 4 (unofficially extending his streak to 67 combined innings). Although he completed the ninth inning in each start, the streak's final game lasted 16 innings, of which he only pitched the first ten. Thus, Hershiser did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a> <a href="Shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutouts</a>. Like Drysdale's streak, the penultimate game of Hershiser's streak was a <a href="Dodgers%E2%80%93Giants%20rivalry">Dodgers–Giants</a> game that featured a controversial umpire's ruling that saved the streak.

The streak was initially overshadowed by Hershiser achieving 20 wins and the race for the NL <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> between Hershiser and <a href="Danny%20Jackson">Danny Jackson</a> until Hershiser reached 40 consecutive innings. Another distraction during the streak was his wife's pregnancy and his son's childbirth complications. The record-setting game was overshadowed by the <a href="1988%20Summer%20Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a>, <a href="American%20football">football</a>, and baseball <a href="pennant%20race">pennant race</a>s; it was not broadcast on local television in Los Angeles. Following the regular season, Hershiser was awarded the NL Cy Young Award. In the playoffs, he earned both the <a href="League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NL Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award</a> and the <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">World Series MVP Award</a>. He also secured <a href="Sportsman%20of%20the%20Year">Sportsman of the Year</a> and <a href="Associated%20Press%20Athlete%20of%20the%20Year">Associated Press Athlete of the Year</a> honors. Hershiser appeared in the <a href="1989%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1989 MLB All-Star Game</a> and continued to be an effective pitcher for many seasons, including two additional appearances in the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>, one of which was preceded by his winning the <a href="1995%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1995 AL Championship Series</a> MVP Award.

Hershiser was selected by Dodgers in the 17th round of the <a href="1979%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1979 MLB draft</a> with the 440th overall selection. He made his professional debut with the <a href="Class%20A%20%28baseball%29">Class A</a> Dodger <a href="Farm%20team%23Baseball">farm team</a> in the <a href="Midwest%20League">Midwest League</a>, the <a href="Clinton%20Dodgers">Clinton Dodgers</a> in 1979. He made his major league debut for the Dodgers on September 1, 1983, against the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a>. Hershisher made his first start on May 26, 1984, against the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> and became a full-time starter in the Dodgers' rotation on July 14.

Hershiser had pitched a -inning scoreless streak in 1984, eventually joining <a href="Gaylord%20Perry">Gaylord Perry</a> and <a href="Luis%20Tiant">Luis Tiant</a> as the only pitchers between 1963 and 2014 with at least two streaks of this length. Hershiser's 1984 streak, which was the longest scoreless inning streak of the year, was broken up on July 24 by a <a href="home%20run">home run</a> by two-time NL <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> <a href="Dale%20Murphy">Dale Murphy</a> of the <a href="1984%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a>. His streak included a <a href="blown%20save">blown save</a> on July 8 against the <a href="1984%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a> and a nine-inning shutout against the Cardinals on July 19.

Despite an emergency <a href="appendectomy">appendectomy</a> that delayed his <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> and shortened his time to get in shape for the season, Hershiser had been named <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Pitcher%20of%20the%20Month%20Award">NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month</a> in April and a participant in the <a href="1988%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1988 All-Star Game</a>, getting <a href="Out%20%28baseball%29">outs</a> against all three <a href="Batter%20%28baseball%29">batters</a>. In the eight games he started between July 10 and August 14, Hershiser had a 3–4 <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win–loss record</a> with a 4.76 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA), raising his season ERA from 2.46 to 3.06. Following his August 14 start in which he left the game after two innings (his shortest appearance since 1985) with the Dodgers behind the <a href="1988%20San%20Francisco%20Giants%20season">Giants</a> 8–2, he pitched <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a>s on August 19 (a <a href="shutout%20%28baseball%29">shutout</a>) and August 24. Prior to the game, Hershiser trailed teammate <a href="Tim%20Leary%20%28baseball%29">Tim Leary</a> in shutouts, six to three, and Leary also combined with other pitchers to record a shutout that was not counted in his individual total.

Previously, <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a> of the <a href="1913%20Washington%20Senators%20season">1913 Washington Senators</a> had held the consecutive scoreless innings record, at , with two relief appearances, which gave him a fractional total. In 1968, Drysdale, also of the Dodgers, surpassed Johnson by pitching innings in six consecutive nine-inning shutouts between May 14 and June 4, 1968. Drysdale's streak ended with four scoreless innings in a 5-3 victory over the <a href="1968%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">Philadelphia Phillies</a> on June 8.

The streak spanned Hershiser's 29th through 35th (and final) <a href="Starting%20pitcher">starts</a> of the 1988 season for the Dodgers, which were the 190th through 196th games of his career. It began on August 30 against the Expos, after seven-time All-Star <a href="Tim%20Raines">Tim Raines</a> scored with two outs in the 5th inning. The streak ended on April 5, 1989 against <a href="1989%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati</a>, when <a href="Barry%20Larkin">Barry Larkin</a> scored with two outs in the first inning. During the streak, although forty-one of the 59 scoreless innings came on the road away from traditionally pitcher-friendly <a href="Dodger%20Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a>, Hershiser lowered his ERA from 2.90 to 2.26. The Dodgers only scored 13 runs in support of Hershiser's 59 innings. Overall, opposing hitters batted 0-for-9 with runners on third and 0-for-31 with runners in scoring position. During the streak, according to the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", Hershiser caused opposing teams to <a href="left%20on%20base">leave 30 runners on base</a>; Drysdale, in his streak, left 35. However, "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" reported that Hershiser left 36 runners on base. At that point in his career, Hershiser was regarded as a "right-handed sinkerball artist" although he did not throw a <a href="Sinker%20%28baseball%29">sinker</a>. He relied on a <a href="fastball">fastball</a>, <a href="slider">slider</a>, <a href="curveball">curveball</a>, and a <a href="split-finger%20fastball">split-finger fastball</a>, the latter of which he used as a sinker.

Once Hershiser achieved his second consecutive complete-game shutout to reach 22 consecutive scoreless innings, he was lauded for his 20th win in the national press while the local press praised his serious contention for the Cy Young Award, given to the league's best pitcher. The 20th win had been his preseason goal. His third consecutive complete-game shutout, which brought him to 31 consecutive innings, was said in local newspapers to have strengthened his Cy Young Award chances and in national newspapers to have helped his team in the pennant race. There was little emphasis on the historical context of his streak at this point, even among newspapers that headlined the streak. Upon reaching 40 consecutive innings, most of the national media began to mention that the record was 58 (in some cases ). In some papers, Hershiser's approach to the record was being described as a chase. Hershiser, however, said that he was primarily focused on his hospitalized newborn son.

After Hershiser reached 49 consecutive innings because of what some sources describe as an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a <a href="double%20play">double play</a>, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, who had a similar incident occur during his streak. The "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued to refer to the record as innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious to talk to him about the streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... I talk about it all the time. I'm not superstitious."

The Dodgers entered the game with a 76–54 record and a 6.5-game lead in the NL West over the <a href="1988%20Houston%20Astros%20season">Houston Astros</a>, while the <a href="1988%20Montreal%20Expos%20season">Montreal Expos</a> were 11 games back in third place in the <a href="National%20League%20East">NL East</a> with a 66–64 record entering the game. With the August 30 win, the Dodgers retained their 6.5-game lead. The win marked the Dodgers' fifth consecutive win and twelfth out of 15. Hershiser contributed a two-run <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a> in the second inning to help the Dodgers build a 3–0 lead. After Hershiser gave up two runs in the fifth, no baserunners reached second base against him in the final four innings, thus marking the first four scoreless innings of his streak. The game marked Hershiser's third consecutive and tenth complete game of the season. Following the game, his 2.84 ERA ranked third on the team behind <a href="Tim%20Leary%20%28baseball%29">Tim Leary</a> (2.44) and <a href="John%20Tudor%20%28baseball%29">John Tudor</a> (2.37).

Hershiser had been scheduled to pitch against the <a href="National%20League">NL</a>-leading <a href="1988%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">New York Mets</a> (80–54) on Sunday, September 4, but a <a href="Rainout%20%28sports%29">rainout</a> delayed his performance. The Dodgers entered the game with a 77–57 record and a 5-game lead in the NL West over the Astros, while the <a href="1988%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a> were 31 games back in sixth place in the division with a 46–88 record entering the game. With the September 5 win, the Dodgers retained their 5-game lead. Hershiser struck out Dale Murphy four times, once resorting to a rare <a href="sidearm">sidearm</a> curveball to do so, to the dismay of <a href="pitching%20coach">pitching coach</a> <a href="Ron%20Perranoski">Ron Perranoski</a>, who worried about injuries caused by sidearm pitching. According to <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>'s Mark Simon, this was the only game of Murphy's 2,180-game career in which a single pitcher <a href="Golden%20sombrero">struck him out four times</a>. After a two-out walk to <a href="Dion%20James">Dion James</a> in the third inning, Hershiser allowed no baserunners until the ninth inning. With his fourth straight complete game, Hershiser raised his record to 19–8, making him 3–1 with a 1.00 ERA in those games.

The Dodgers entered the game with a 79–60 record and a four-game lead in the NL West over the Houston Astros, while the <a href="1988%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a> were 5.5 games back in third place in the division with a 74–66 record entering the game. With the September 10 win, the Dodgers held a five-game lead. Although left-handed pitcher <a href="Fernando%20Valenzuela">Fernando Valenzuela</a> had won 20 games in 1986, Hershiser became the first Dodger righthander to win 20 games since <a href="Don%20Sutton">Don Sutton</a> in 1976. Hershiser said, about reaching this accomplishment, "It's a goal that the world sets as a standard, and when you reach it, it's a great feeling". In the Cy Young Award race, <a href="Danny%20Jackson">Danny Jackson</a> of the Reds had beaten the Dodgers the night before to move to 21-6 with a 2.43 ERA (against Hershiser's 20-8 with a 2.62 ERA). In the third inning, Hershiser struck out <a href="Eric%20Davis%20%28baseball%29">Eric Davis</a> with the bases loaded and two outs and later got Davis to hit into two double plays. In the seventh inning, <a href="Ken%20Griffey%2C%20Sr.">Ken Griffey, Sr.</a> and Larkin were retired after the Reds put runners on first and third base with one out. The game marked Hershiser's fourth consecutive complete game (and twelfth of the season).

The Dodgers entered the game with an 83–60 record and a 6.5-game lead in the NL West over the Astros, while the Atlanta Braves were 34 games back in 6th place in the division with a 49–94 record entering the game. With Hershiser's September 14 win, the Dodgers maintained a 6.5-game lead. Hershiser's record on the season against the Braves was 5–0 with a 1.29 ERA. The game marked only the third time in 1988 that he pitched on three days rest. Lasorda and Perranoski moved Hershiser's start up one day because they wanted him to pitch the next week against the second-place Houston Astros. With the streak at 31 innings Hershiser tied Jackson in number of wins, and moved into a tie for the sixth longest scoreless streak for the franchise since the 1958 relocation to Los Angeles. Although Drysdale's record was mentioned after he reached 31 consecutive innings, the focus of the media was on the Cy Young Award race with Jackson. The win was Hershiser's seventh consecutive against the Braves, a streak that began on September 13, 1987.

The Braves opened the third inning with back-to-back singles by <a href="Ozzie%20Virgil%2C%20Jr.">Ozzie Virgil</a> and <a href="Terry%20Blocker">Terry Blocker</a>. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher <a href="Rick%20Mahler">Rick Mahler</a> and <a href="Ron%20Gant">Ron Gant</a> and then retiring <a href="Jeff%20Blauser">Jeff Blauser</a> on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Thomas">Andrés Thomas</a> was followed with an error by <a href="Franklin%20Stubbs">Franklin Stubbs</a>, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: "It was the worst I've thrown in the last five or six starts...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I had to work hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful <a href="Hit%20and%20run%20%28baseball%29">hit and run</a> play in which <a href="Mike%20Marshall%20%28outfielder%29">Mike Marshall</a> on a 2-2 count doubled <a href="Kirk%20Gibson">Kirk Gibson</a> in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: "Let me tell you, it wasn't a hit-and-run. Gibby was probably going with two strikes. We never would hit-and-run with us. You can call it a run-and-hit." Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled <a href="induced%20labor">induced labor</a> for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.

The Dodgers entered the game with an 86–61 record and a nine-game lead in the NL West over the Astros and Giants who each held a 78–71 record. With the September 19 win, the Dodgers held a 9.5-game lead over the Reds. The game marked Hershiser's second consecutive 1–0 victory. The game marked <a href="Nolan%20Ryan">Nolan Ryan</a>'s final start for the Astros. He pitched two innings (striking out four Dodgers) before leaving the game because of a <a href="hamstring">hamstring</a> cramp. Hershiser retired the final 13 batters in a row. Based on the rules in place on September 20, Hershiser would have ended up 2/3 inning shy of Drysdale record even with two nine-inning shutouts in his final two starts. Jackson also won his 22nd game that night. Hershiser's ERA in the seven consecutive complete games had fallen to 0.57. Houston's strongest scoring opportunities came about because of Dodger errors: <a href="Kevin%20Bass">Kevin Bass</a> recorded a two-out single followed by a stolen base. Then a Griffin error on a <a href="Glenn%20Davis%20%28baseball%29">Glenn Davis</a> ground ball moved the runner to third base and dangerously close to home plate. Also, in the fifth inning Stubbs' error put runners on first and second with no outs. The game marked Hershiser's sixth (and fourth consecutive) shutout of the season, making him the first Dodger since Drysdale in 1968 to record four in a row. This performance of September 19 was the middle of three consecutive shutouts posted by the Dodgers. Tudor posted one on September 18 with relief from <a href="Alejandro%20Pe%C3%B1a">Alejandro Peña</a>; <a href="Tim%20Belcher">Tim Belcher</a> pitched a shutout on September 20.

On September 19, Hershiser's four-day-old son Jordan was suffering from fluid buildup in his lungs in a Pasadena hospital. Hershiser, by winning that day reduced the Dodgers' <a href="Magic%20number%20%28sports%29">magic number</a> to five over the Reds. Publications such as "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "Chicago Tribune" and the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" began to take note of the streak length and the nearer horizon of the record as Hershiser reached 40 consecutive innings with this win. Several Canadian newspapers even used the word chasing to note Hershiser's progress—e.g., "<a href="The%20Ottawa%20Citizen">The Ottawa Citizen</a>" ran a story titled "Hershiser chasing record".

In order that Hershiser and the rest of the staff could have their normal number of days of rest heading into the playoff series that could start as early as October 3, Hershiser pitched on only three days rest rather than making his regular start on September 24. The Dodgers entered the game with an 89–63 record and an 8-game lead in the NL West over the Cincinnati Reds, while the San Francisco Giants were 10.5 games back in fourth place in the division with a 79–74 record entering the game. With the September 23 win, the Dodgers retained an 8-game lead over the Reds. The victory reduced the Dodgers' magic number to two. The game marked Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout, which stretched his consecutive scoreless inning streak to 49. Following the game, Hershiser was quoted as saying "I want to keep putting zeroes up there — not because of the streak, but for the team...I want to stay hot right up through the playoffs."

Prior to the start, Seymour Siwoff, the <a href="Elias%20Sports%20Bureau">Elias Sports Bureau</a> chief and official <a href="statistician">statistician</a> for MLB, determined that the official method of accounting for consecutive scoreless innings would only count whole innings for starting pitchers and that if the streak extended into 1989 it would bear an asterisk. Previously there had been division among various sources on whether to include fractional innings. According to some sources, official statisticians such as Siwoff had a long history of only counting complete scoreless innings by starting pitchers. Hershiser's September 23 shutout moved him to third on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list, behind Johnson and Drysdale. He also passed <a href="Carl%20Hubbell">Carl Hubbell</a> and <a href="G.%20Harris%20White">G. Harris "Doc" White</a>, who each had streaks of 45 innings on the newly redefined record's list and <a href="Bob%20Gibson">Bob Gibson</a>, who had a streak of 47 before the record was redefined. Hershiser also became one of three pitchers to throw five consecutive shutouts, joining Drysdale, who did it in 1968 and White, who did it in 1904. His 23 wins were the most by a Dodger since <a href="Sandy%20Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> had won 27 games in 1966.

During the third inning of the September 23 game, according to articles written by ESPN and the "Los Angeles Times", after <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Uribe">José Uribe</a> and <a href="Atlee%20Hammaker">Atlee Hammaker</a> got on base with consecutive singles, <a href="Brett%20Butler%20%28baseball%29">Brett Butler</a> grounded into a <a href="Force%20play">force out</a> at second base to leave Uribe on third and Butler on first. When <a href="Ernie%20Riles">Ernie Riles</a> hit a groundball, Butler interfered with Dodger shortstop <a href="Alfredo%20Griffin">Alfredo Griffin</a> causing a bad throw and breaking up the double play. A run was posted on the scoreboard after Uribe crossed home plate. However, <a href="Bob%20Engel">Bob Engel</a> ruled the double play had been broken up by <a href="interference%20%28baseball%29">interference</a>, making the play a double play. This allowed the streak to continue beyond 42 innings. Contemporaneous sources such as "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" and "Los Angeles Times" noted that when Butler swiped at Griffin's leg, Griffin threw over the head of <a href="Tracy%20Woodson">Tracy Woodson</a>. Other contemporaneous sources such as "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" and "USA Today" said that <a href="Paul%20Runge%20%28umpire%29">Paul Runge</a> ruled that Butler had interfered with second baseman <a href="Steve%20Sax">Steve Sax</a>' relay throw to Griffin. Several sources noted that late in Drysdale's streak, Drysdale benefited similarly when <a href="Harry%20Wendelstedt">Harry Wendelstedt</a> nullified <a href="Dick%20Dietz">Dick Dietz</a>' bases loaded <a href="hit%20by%20pitch">hit by pitch</a> for failing to attempt to avoid the pitch.

Hershiser retired the side in order in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings. In the game, Giants manager <a href="Roger%20Craig%20%28baseball%29">Roger Craig</a> made what some describe as a questionable pinch hitting substitution. In order to contest Hershiser with a left-handed batter, with runners on first and second and one out, he substituted rookie <a href="Francisco%20Mel%C3%A9ndez">Francisco Meléndez</a> (batting .190) for <a href="Robby%20Thompson">Robby Thompson</a> (batting .266), which resulted in an inning-ending double play. That day, "USA Today" claimed Dodgers' manager <a href="Tommy%20Lasorda">Tommy Lasorda</a> had determined his postseason pitching rotation with Hershiser slated for game one of the NLCS, but Lasorda denied having any plan in place for a playoff appearance that had not yet been clinched. The Dodgers' runs came on <a href="Mickey%20Hatcher">Mickey Hatcher</a>'s first home run of the season in the eighth inning. 

As his turn in the rotation approached, Hershiser joked that he would skip a start and rest for the playoffs rather than pursue the record. The Dodgers had clinched the <a href="National%20League%20West">NL West</a> on September 26. Thus, the focus of the game on the 28th was on Hershiser's need to get nine scoreless innings to tie Drysdale, which was Hershiser's hope. On September 27, Lasorda announced the Dodger starting pitchers for games one (Hershiser) and game two (Tudor) of the NL Championship series, which would begin the following Tuesday, October 4. The Dodgers entered the game with a 92–65 record and a seven-game lead in the NL West over the Cincinnati Reds, while the <a href="1988%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season">San Diego Padres</a> were 13 games back in fifth place in the division with a 79–78 record entering the game. With the September 28 loss, the Dodgers retained a seven-game lead over the Reds. In the off days leading up to Hershiser's last start, <a href="Frank%20Viola">Frank Viola</a> had tied Jackson and Hershiser at 23 wins for the MLB lead.

Hershiser had ended Padres catcher <a href="Benito%20Santiago">Benito Santiago</a>'s 34-game <a href="hitting%20streak">hitting streak</a> the year before and the Padres were eager to snap Hershiser's streak. Santiago's streak was an MLB record for a catcher, an MLB record for a rookie and a team record for the Padres. No one who has started a hitting streak at age 22 or younger has matched the streak since. According to <a href="Tony%20Gwynn">Tony Gwynn</a>, "We wanted so badly to put a run on the board...Maybe, we tried a little too hard. You have to give the man credit. He didn't give me one decent pitch to hit all night. He put everything right where he wanted it to go."

Prior to the game Hershiser explained why he wanted to win a World Series more than break the scoreless innings streak: "You can break a record or win a Cy Young and go home and celebrate with your wife and friends, but after it's over there's only a few people that really care about it. But if you win a team thing, you've got 24 guys and all their families, all their friends, a whole city celebrating."

Hershiser picked <a href="Roberto%20Alomar">Roberto Alomar</a> off at first base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser did not want to continue: "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be together at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, I might as well get the guy out." Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and <a href="Ben%20Hines">Ben Hines</a> all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a <a href="Keith%20Moreland">Keith Moreland</a> flyball caught by <a href="right%20fielder">right fielder</a> <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%28baseball%29">José González</a>. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. <a href="Marvell%20Wynne%20%28baseball%29">Marvell Wynne</a> struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a> evaded catcher <a href="Mike%20Scioscia">Mike Scioscia</a>. The following two hitters, Santiago and <a href="Randy%20Ready">Randy Ready</a>, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, <a href="Garry%20Templeton">Garry Templeton</a> was given an <a href="intentional%20base%20on%20balls">intentional base on balls</a>. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.

Even after achieving the record, Hershiser expressed regret: "Because of respect for Don and respect for the record, I don't think I should have walked to the mound in a situation where I'm supposed to be resting for the playoffs, just to beat a record. That would have tarnished the whole thing." According to some sources, Drysdale was the person who convinced Hershiser to take the mound for the tenth inning, saying, "I gave him a kick in the pants and told him to get out there and go as far as he can". However, other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser's hesitance to break the record, he would have reassured him, saying "I'd have kicked him right in the rear if I had known that... I'd have told him to get his buns out there and get them."

When the tenth inning ended, giving Hershiser the record, he "stood bent with his hands on his knees for a long moment after the final out and then was inundated by teammates pouring out of the dugout to congratulate him." Drysdale served as the Dodger radio broadcast announcer with <a href="Vin%20Scully">Vin Scully</a> that year. As Hershiser left the mound with the record in hand, he was searching for Drysdale and saying "Where is Drysdale? I've got to find Drysdale". Drysdale was on hand to congratulate Hershiser after the game. In fact, when Hershiser returned to the <a href="dugout%20%28baseball%29">dugout</a>, Drysdale was waiting with his microphone for an interview.

During Hershiser's streak he posted 59 IP, 0 runs, 31 hits, 38 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits, while Drysdale had posted 58 IP, 0 runs, 28 hits, 45 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits. Drysdale maintained the record for consecutive shutouts (6) because Hershiser did not pitch beyond the first 10 innings of his September 28 start because it lasted <a href="extra%20innings">16 innings</a>. Hershiser's record was overshadowed because the <a href="1988%20Summer%20Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a> and the start of the <a href="1988%20NFL%20season">1988 National Football League season</a> occurred at the same time. Los Angeles had two NFL teams at the time (<a href="1988%20Los%20Angeles%20Rams%20season">Los Angeles Rams</a> and <a href="1988%20Los%20Angeles%20Raiders%20season">Los Angeles Raiders</a>). Additionally, baseball fans were more concerned with pennant races. Furthermore, four of the final five games in the streak were played in the <a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">Pacific Time Zone</a>, limiting the games' visibility to the rest of the country. Controversially, <a href="KTTV">KTTV</a> did not broadcast either the September 26 game in which the Dodgers clinched the NL West or the September 28 game in which Hershiser set the record. Instead, it showed "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%281980%20film%29">Friday the 13th</a>" and "<a href="The%20Funhouse">The Funhouse</a>" on September 26 and 28, respectively. The record-setting game drew an attendance of 22,596.

The New York Mets concluded the regular season with a record of 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the <a href="1988%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">1988 NL Championship Series</a> (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, <a href="Gregg%20Jefferies">Gregg Jefferies</a> led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with <a href="Keith%20Hernandez">Keith Hernandez</a>. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, <a href="Darryl%20Strawberry">Darryl Strawberry</a> posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher <a href="David%20Cone">David Cone</a> attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on <a href="Gary%20Carter">Gary Carter</a>'s shallow fly ball that center fielder <a href="John%20Shelby">John Shelby</a> could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.

The Dodgers entered the game with a 0–1 record, having lost to the Reds, who were 1–0 the day before. As Hershiser prepared for his first start, he said that the continuation of the streak via the asterisk did not mean much to him and that in his mind the streak was already over. His mound opponent was <a href="Tom%20Browning">Tom Browning</a> who had pitched a <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a> the last time he had faced the Dodgers (September 16, 1988). <a href="Todd%20Benzinger">Todd Benzinger</a> drove in Larkin to end Hershiser's streak in the first inning and Hershiser was tagged with his first loss since August 24. The Dodgers endured three errors and a <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a> in the game. <a href="Leadoff%20hitter">Leadoff hitter</a> Larkin chopped a groundball over Hershiser into centerfield. Hershiser's <a href="pick%20off">pick off</a> throw hit Larkin's armpit. After Hershiser retired <a href="Chris%20Sabo">Chris Sabo</a> and Eric Davis via strikeout, he walked <a href="Kal%20Daniels">Kal Daniels</a>, who had a career .500 batting average and four home runs against Hershiser, on four pitches. Then Benzinger, with whom Hershiser was unfamiliar, singled through the right side of the Dodger infield to score Larkin thus ending Hershiser's streak. Howell did not allow an earned run in his second 1989 outing on April 10. Thus, Howell's streak went from August 11, 1988, through April 9, 1989.

It had been unlikely that Hershiser would ever become a successful major league pitcher. He was unable to make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He failed to make the <a href="Bowling%20Green%20State%20University">Bowling Green State University</a> team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind <a href="Dwight%20Gooden">Dwight Gooden</a>) career ERA among active pitchers, he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, "I think someone's going to break it from me because I know I'm not any big deal".

After his NLCS game one performance, Hershiser went on to post a scoreless innings streak in the 1988 NL Championship Series and <a href="1988%20World%20Series">1988 World Series</a>, winning both the <a href="League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NL Championship Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award</a> and the <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">World Series MVP Award</a>. Hershiser also won the 1988 NL <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>. Hershiser's season was recognized outside of baseball as well. He earned the <a href="Sportsman%20of%20the%20Year">Sportsman of the Year</a> from "Sports Illustrated" in December and <a href="Associated%20Press%20Athlete%20of%20the%20Year">Associated Press Athlete of the Year</a> in January 1989, becoming the first non-Olympian to win the award in an Olympic year in 20 years. After seeking <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20transactions%23Free%20agency%20and%20salary%20arbitration">arbitration</a> in January, Hershiser signed a new three-year, $7.9 million contract on February 16. Hershiser's annual salary of $2,766,667 (equal to $ in dollars) moved him ahead of <a href="Cal%20Ripken">Cal Ripken</a> as baseball's highest-paid player at the time. Following his success of the 1988 season, Hershiser realized any future exploits would be seen comparatively as a failure, even as he began spring training in 1989 with the streak still active.

Hershiser's combined single-season total of innings pitched including both the regular season and postseason has not been surpassed since 1988. Nonetheless, he would lead the NL in innings pitched for a third consecutive season in 1989. Hershiser's statistics in 1989 were nearly identical to 1988 except for his win–loss record. Two wins during the 1988 streak were against the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>. Hershiser would eventually win twelve consecutive decisions against the Braves (a post-1920 record for a pitcher against a single franchise). His 1–0 win on September 14 over the Braves and 1–0 win over the Astros on September 19 were the last of his three career 1–0 victories. After posting seven shutouts in his previous eleven starts, he was only able to tally six more in his remaining 319 career starts. Hershiser was selected to the <a href="1989%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1989 MLB All-Star Game</a> and also contributed to two <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> World Series runs (<a href="1995%20World%20Series">1995</a> and <a href="1997%20World%20Series">1997</a>), earning another League Championship Series MVP in 1995.

Sports historians consider Hershiser's record to be among the greatest streaks in sports history and among baseball's most outstanding records. ESPN's Jeff Merron named it the third-greatest individual streak in sports history, behind <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>'s 56-game hitting streak and <a href="Edwin%20Moses">Edwin Moses</a>' 107 straight hurdles finals wins. In "Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records" by Kerry Banks, Hershiser's streak is ranked as the seventh-greatest baseball record.

The record that Hershiser broke was regarded as "one of the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20records%20considered%20unbreakable">most unbreakable records in baseball</a>". In 2013, the 25th anniversary of Hershiser's record-breaking season was widely heralded in the press. ESPN, "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Daily%20News">Los Angeles Daily News</a>", and <a href="SB%20Nation">SB Nation</a> are among the media outlets that covered the anniversary. SB Nation ran stories on the 25th anniversary of each of Hershiser's starts during the streak. "<a href="Baseball%20Digest">Baseball Digest</a>" celebrated the accomplishment with stories during the 10th, 15th and 20th anniversary seasons.

In the first 25 years after Hershiser recorded his streak, the closest challenge came from <a href="Brandon%20Webb">Brandon Webb</a> of the <a href="2007%20Arizona%20Diamondbacks%20season">2007 Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, who pitched 42 consecutive scoreless innings. <a href="Greg%20Maddux">Greg Maddux</a> and <a href="Kenny%20Rogers%20%28baseball%29">Kenny Rogers</a> were the only other pitchers to have reached 39 innings during that time period.

<a href="R.A.%20Dickey">R.A. Dickey</a> threw a streak of more than 32 consecutive scoreless innings that broke the Mets franchise record in <a href="2012%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">2012</a>. The streak was snapped by baseball etiquette against "<a href="running%20up%20the%20score">running up the score</a>"; Mets manager <a href="Terry%20Collins">Terry Collins</a> opted not to position his infield in with a runner on third and one out with a 9–0 lead, allowing a routine ground ball hit to score a runner and end Dickey's streak.

In 2014, Dodgers ace <a href="Clayton%20Kershaw">Clayton Kershaw</a> pitched 41 consecutive scoreless innings, before giving up a solo home run to Padres' <a href="Chase%20Headley">Chase Headley</a> on July 10. In 2015 another Dodger, <a href="Zack%20Greinke">Zack Greinke</a>, maintained a streak of 45 consecutive innings without allowing a run. It ended on July 26.

A Song for Simeon

"A Song for Simeon" is a 37-line poem written in 1928 by American-English poet <a href="T.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BS.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> (1888–1965). It is <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot%27s%20Ariel%20poems">one of five poems</a> that Eliot contributed to the "<a href="Ariel%20poems%20%28Faber%29">Ariel poems</a>" series of 38 pamphlets by several authors published by <a href="Faber%20and%20Faber">Faber and Gwyer</a>. "A Song for Simeon" was the sixteenth in the series and included an illustration by <a href="avant%20garde">avant garde</a> artist <a href="Edward%20McKnight%20Kauffer">Edward McKnight Kauffer</a>. The poems, including "A Song for Simeon", were later published in both the 1936 and 1963 editions of Eliot's collected poems.

In 1927, Eliot had converted to <a href="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholicism</a> and his poetry, starting with the "Ariel Poems" (1927–31) and "<a href="Ash%20Wednesday">Ash Wednesday</a>" (1930), took on a decidedly religious character. "A Song for Simeon" is seen by many critics and scholars as a discussion of the conversion experience. In the poem, Eliot retells the story of <a href="Simeon%20%28Gospel%20of%20Luke%29">Simeon</a> from the second chapter of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, a just and devout Jew who encounters <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary</a>, <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Joseph</a> and the infant Jesus entering the <a href="Temple%20of%20Jerusalem">Temple of Jerusalem</a>. Promised by the <a href="Holy%20Ghost">Holy Ghost</a> that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour, Simeon sees in the infant Jesus the <a href="Messiah">Messiah</a> promised by the Lord and asks God to permit him to "depart in peace" ().

The poem's narrative echoes the text of the , a liturgical prayer for <a href="Compline">Compline</a> from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers <a href="Lancelot%20Andrewes">Lancelot Andrewes</a>, <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> and <a href="St.%20John%20of%20the%20Cross">St. John of the Cross</a>. Critics have debated whether Eliot's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence of <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> on Eliot's part.

In 1925, Eliot became a poetry editor at the London publishing firm of Faber and Gwyer, Ltd., after a career in banking, and subsequent to the success of his earlier poems, including "<a href="The%20Love%20Song%20of%20J.%20Alfred%20Prufrock">The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</a>" (1915), "<a href="Gerontion">Gerontion</a>" (1920) and "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>" (1922). In these years, Eliot gravitated away from his <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> upbringing and began to embrace the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. He was <a href="baptism">baptised</a> into the Anglican faith on 29 June 1927 at <a href="Finstock">Finstock</a>, in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, and was <a href="Confirmation">confirmed</a> the following day in the private chapel of <a href="Thomas%20Banks%20Strong">Thomas Banks Strong</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Oxford">Bishop of Oxford</a>. Eliot converted in private, but subsequently declared in his 1927 preface to a collection of essays titled "For Lancelot Andrewes" that he considered himself a classicist in literature, a royalist in politics, and an Anglo-Catholic in religion. When his <a href="Religious%20conversion">conversion</a> became known, it was "an understandable choice to those around him" given his intellectual convictions, and that "he could not have done anything less than seek what he regarded as the most ancient, most sacramental, and highest expression of the Christian faith that forms the indisputable basis for the culture and civilization of modern Europe". Eliot's conversion and his adherence to <a href="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholicism</a> informed and influenced his later poetry.

Critical reviews of Eliot's poems shifted as well, with some critics asserting that Eliot's work suffered with the addition of Christian themes. One critic, Morton Zabel said that this "deprived his art of its once incomparable distinction in style and tone". Other critics thought Eliot's exploration of Christian themes was a positive development in his poetry, including Gordon Symes, who recognised it as "an evaluation of old age, an elucidation of its special grace, and an appreciation of its special function in the progress of the soul".

In 1927, Eliot was asked by his employer, <a href="Geoffrey%20Faber">Geoffrey Faber</a>, to write one poem each year for a series of illustrated pamphlets with holiday themes to be sent to the firm's clients and business acquaintances as Christmas greetings. This series, called the <a href="Ariel%20poems%20%28Faber%29">"Ariel Series"</a>, consisted of 38 <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>s published between 1927 and 1931 featuring poems and brief prose from a selection of English writers and poets. The first poem that Eliot wrote, "<a href="The%20Journey%20of%20the%20Magi">The Journey of the Magi</a>", was printed as the eighth in the series in August 1927. For the second, "A Song for Simeon", Eliot turned to an event at the end of Nativity narrative in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>. The printing of the poem, the sixteenth in the series, was completed on 24 September 1928. Eliot would follow these with three more poems: "Animula" in October 1929, "Marina" in September 1930, and "Triumphal March" in October 1931. Four of Eliot's five "Ariel" poems, including "A Song for Simeon", were accompanied by illustrations by American-born <a href="avant%20garde">avant garde</a> artist, <a href="E.%20McKnight%20Kauffer">E. McKnight Kauffer</a>.

Faber and Gwyer printed "A Song for Simeon" in an 8½-inch × 5½-inch <a href="Paper%20size%23North%20American%20paper%20sizes">Demy</a> <a href="Octavo">Octavo</a> (8vo) pamphlet in blue paper wraps with title in black ink. The poem was printed on two pages, accompanied by a colour image by Kauffer, and included one page of advertisements. Faber and Gwyer contracted with the <a href="Curwen%20Press">Curwen Press</a> in <a href="Plaistow%2C%20Newham">Plaistow</a> to print 3,500 copies. The font of the cover and poem text was Walbaum, created by J. E. Walbaum of Goslar and Weimar in Germany in 1836. According to Gilmour, the edition was printed "in batches of eight".

In 1936, Faber and Faber, the successor firm to Faber and Gwyer, collected "A Song for Simeon" and three of the other poems under the heading "Ariel Poems" for an edition of Eliot's collected poems. ("Triumphal March" appears as Section 1 of "Coriolan" in the "Unfinished Poems" section.) When Faber released another series in 1954, Eliot included a sixth poem, "The Cultivation of Christmas Trees", which was added to Faber's 1963 edition of his collected poems. Both editions of collected poems were published in the United States by <a href="Harcourt%20%28publisher%29">Harcourt, Brace & Company</a>.

All six poems were published together as a separate publication for the first time by Faber & Faber in 2014. This publication included the original illustrations.

"A Song for Simeon" is a 37-line poem written in <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a>. The poem does not have a consistent pattern of <a href="Meter%20%28poetry%29">meter</a>. The lines range in length from three syllables to fifteen syllables. Eliot uses <a href="end%20rhyme">end rhyme</a> sporadically in 21 lines of the poem, specifically:

Eliot's use of "lamentation", "desolation" and "consolation"—a repetition of the two-syllable "-ation" ending—is an example of <a href="Syllable%23Structure">syllable rhyme</a>. Eliot employs <a href="Rhyme%23Types%20of%20rhyme">forced rhyme</a> (also called "oblique rhyme") on "peace" and "ease" (lines 8 and 11), and <a href="eye%20rhyme">eye rhyme</a> on "home" and "come" (lines 14 and 15).

"A Song for Simeon" is structured as a first-person <a href="dramatic%20monologue">dramatic monologue</a> spoken by Simeon. Eliot's style of monologue used in the poem (and in many of his works) draws heavily from the influence of English <a href="Victorian%20literature">Victorian poet</a> <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a> (1812–1889). Literary scholar Martin Scofield directly identifies Simeon's recitation as "the voice of the Browningesque dramatic monologue" and characterises Eliot's use of Simeon as a speaker as a "mask that half hides and half reveals the poet".

Most scholars and critics addressing the poem focus on the Gospel narrative for a source of interpretation as Eliot's poem quotes several lines verbatim from the passage in Luke, from the . Scofield says that the poem is "characterized by deliberately Biblical language, interwoven with actual phrases from the Gospels".

The subject of Eliot's poem is drawn from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke (), and the early Christian <a href="canticle">canticle</a> derived from it. In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the <a href="Temple%20of%20Jerusalem">Temple of Jerusalem</a> at the time <a href="Mary%2C%20Mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary</a> and <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Joseph</a> bring the infant Jesus to be presented in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom. Luke states that Simeon is "waiting for the consolation of Israel" after being promised that "he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ". () Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him into his arms and prays, prophesying the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come. This prayer would become known later as the from its Latin <a href="incipit">incipit</a>.

<poem>
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace : according to thy word.
For mine eyes have seen : thy salvation,
Which thou hast prepared : before the face of all people;
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles : and to be the glory of thy people Israel. ()
</poem>

The is the traditional "Gospel Canticle" of Night Prayer that is often called the "Song of Simeon" or "Canticle of Simeon". In the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> tradition, it was used during the Office for <a href="Compline">Compline</a>, the last of the <a href="Canonical%20hours">Canonical hours</a>, in the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</a>. The Anglican tradition combined liturgy of the Catholic offices of <a href="Vespers">Vespers</a> (especially with the "<a href="Magnificat">Magnificat</a>" canticle) and Compline (with the "Nunc dimittis") into <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evening Prayer</a> when compiling the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" during the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>.

In 1886, Eliot's grandfather, <a href="William%20Greenleaf%20Eliot">William Greenleaf Eliot</a>, an American educator and Unitarian minister, wrote a poem titled "Nunc dimittis". Written a few months before his death (and two years before T. S. Eliot's birth,) the elder Eliot's poem used the same gospel text and the poet asks, in his decline, "When may I humbly claim that kind award, / And cares and labors cease?" "A Song for Simeon" has been seen by the Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, an Anglican cleric, as a tacit tribute by Eliot to his grandfather, "for the last years of a grandfather whose faith his grandson has at last taken up for himself".

Scholars have identified allusions by Eliot to other biblical passages, including:

"A Song for Simeon" is not considered by scholars and critics to be one of Eliot's significant poems. It is thus overshadowed by his comparatively better known works of the period—"<a href="The%20Hollow%20Men">The Hollow Men</a>" (1925), written before his conversion; and "The Journey of the Magi" (1927), "<a href="Ash%20Wednesday%20%28poem%29">Ash Wednesday</a>" (1930), and the later, more substantial "<a href="Four%20Quartets">Four Quartets</a>" (1943), written after his conversion. However, in "A Song for Simeon" and these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world, and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith. Scofield states that the imagery of "A Song for Simeon"—including the symbol of a feather, its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun—conveys "a sense of wonder and fragile new life". Robin Griffith-Jones draws a connection between Eliot's image of the feather to a statement by <a href="Hildegard%20of%20Bingen">Hildegard of Bingen</a> comparing herself "to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God. But Eliot's speaker, still waiting for the wind to blow, imagines only the death wind that will bear him away".

According to writer Joseph Maddrey, "A Song for Simeon" shares themes with his more famous conversion poem "Ash Wednesday", the first parts of which Eliot was writing when "A Song for Simeon" was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon to illustrate the "contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two". Eliot's Ariel poems and "Ash Wednesday" explore this new experience of conversion and the progress of the soul. Scofield writes that Eliot's depiction of Simeon presents "a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has come too late for this life". But as he awaits the death for which he asks, Simeon sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission. Simeon wants nothing of this "time of sorrow" and that the fate of persecution for the consequences of faith is not for him.

<poem>
According to thy word.
They shall praise Thee and suffer in every generation
With glory and derision,
Light upon light, mounting the saints' stair.
Not for me the martyrdom, the ecstasy of thought and prayer,
Not for me the ultimate vision.
</poem>
According to Eliot biographer <a href="Lyndall%20Gordon">Lyndall Gordon</a>, in "Ash Wednesday" and the Ariel poems, "Eliot wonders if he does not belong to those who espouse Christianity officially without being properly committed, whose ostentatious piety is 'tainted with a self-conceit.'" The poem is inherently tied to Eliot's religious conversion experience, and connected to Eliot's reading of Anglican divine <a href="Lancelot%20Andrewes">Lancelot Andrewes</a> during this time. Andrewes, in a 1619 Ash Wednesday sermon, emphasised that conversion "must come from both mind and heart, thought and feeling, 'the principall and most proper act of a true turning to God.'" Andrewes' words are channelled again, when Eliot's Simeon "sees a faith that he cannot inhabit in "the still unspeaking and unspoken Word'". Eliot uses the image of the winding staircase—an image that also appears in "Ash Wednesday"—which Gordon indicates is a direct reference to Andrewes' sermon. According to Gordon, "Eliot's penitent ... 'turning on the winding stair', acts out the two mental turns Andrewes prescribed for a conversion: a turn that looks forward to God and a turn that looks backward to one’s sins, sentencing oneself for the past".

The image of a winding stair has also been tied to scenes in Dante's journey from <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a> to <a href="Paradise">Paradise</a> in the "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>". Further, the image is thought associated with stairs as the path of mystical ascent in the writings of sixteenth-century <a href="Spanish%20mystics">Spanish mystic</a> <a href="Saint%20John%20of%20the%20Cross">Saint John of the Cross</a>. Eliot often alludes to this symbol in several of his poems.

Eliot's Simeon appears similar to Dante's depiction of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> in the "Divine Comedy", as "the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot enter the world that he makes possible". Virgil, in the "Divine Comedy", leads Dante through Hell ("<a href="Inferno%20%28Dante%29">Inferno</a>") and Purgatory ("<a href="Purgatorio">Purgatorio</a>"), but cannot guide him into Paradise ("<a href="Paradiso%20%28Dante%29">Paradiso</a>"). In this context, Virgil was a symbol of non-Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God. In Eliot's depiction, Simeon will never know the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing "the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy".

Eliot's poems have frequently been examined for instances of <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>—<a href="prejudice">prejudice</a> or discrimination against <a href="Jews">Jews</a>. Scholar Louis Menand states that while Simeon is treated respectfully by Eliot, his characterisation is "in the tradition of Christian condescension toward the virtuous heathen". Comparatively, <a href="Craig%20Raine">Craig Raine</a>, a poet and an Emeritus <a href="Oxbridge%20Fellow">Fellow</a> of <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, wrote a book-length defence of Eliot against the claims of deliberate anti-Semitism and argues that "A Song for Simeon" provides a sympathetic discussion of the Jewish diaspora. <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a> scholar John Xiros Cooper states that the accusations of anti-Semitism lodged against Eliot rest "on a few isolated lines of poetry" and a passing reference in one prose text. Indeed, Eliot denied the claim, declaring, "I am not an anti-Semite and never have been. It is a terrible slander on a man." Political theorist and author <a href="Leonard%20Woolf">Leonard Woolf</a>, who was both Jewish and one of Eliot's close friends, believed that Eliot was "slightly anti-Semitic in the sort of vague way which is not uncommon. He would have denied it genuinely."

<a href="Anthony%20Julius">Anthony Julius</a>, a British lawyer who is one of Eliot's most trenchant critics on this issue, writes that "A Song for Simeon" is "exceptional in a poetry in which elsewhere Jews are dumb. The voice, however is a disciplined one and speaks lines prepared for it ... . The song is "for", not "of" Simeon. Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him, and by implication all Jews, wholly within the Christian drama. Incapable of denying its truth, but equally incapable of living that truth." He accuses Eliot of animating "the <a href="Literary%20topos">topoi</a> of the Jew acknowledging his obsolescence"—essentially employing a tired characterisation of a Jewish figure as a voice attesting that Jews have no role in the Christian future. Julius compares Simeon to <a href="Moses">Moses</a> stating that he is "fated to see the <a href="Promised%20Land">Promised Land</a> but not to enter it ... witness to its truth, but denied its redemptive power, the Jew stands solemnly, humbly, outside Christianity's gates". Further, Julius draws on a quote from Eliot's earlier poem "Gerontion" to say that in this Christian future the Jews "may find a ledge there to squat on".

Julius' view is considered extreme by many critics. Comparatively, Julius tempered his harsh criticism by claiming that Eliot's anti-Semitism does not detract from the poetry and that it offers a creative force showing rare imaginative power to Eliot's art. Literary critic and professor <a href="Christopher%20Ricks">Christopher Ricks</a> agreed, citing the wit and commentary of Eliot's depictions of Jews; he asserts that Eliot was at his most brilliant in his prejudice.

Family Trade

Family Trade is an American <a href="Reality%20television">reality television series</a> broadcast by <a href="Game%20Show%20Network">Game Show Network</a> (GSN). The show premiered on March 12, 2013; its eighth and final episode aired on April 16, 2013. Filmed in <a href="Middlebury%2C%20Vermont">Middlebury, Vermont</a>, the series chronicles the daily activities of G. Stone Motors, a <a href="GMC%20%28automobile%29">GMC</a> and <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> car dealership that employs the <a href="barter">barter</a> system in selling its automobiles. The business is operated by its founder, Gardner Stone, his son and daughter, Todd and Darcy, and General Manager Travis Romano. The series features the shop's daily interaction with its customers, who bring in a variety of items that can be resold in order to receive a down payment on the vehicle they are leasing or purchasing. Commentary and narration are also often provided by the Stones during the episodes.

"Family Trade" was a part of GSN's intent to broaden their programming landscape since the network had historically aired traditional <a href="game%20show">game show</a>s in most of its programming. The series was given unfavorable reviews by critics, and its television ratings fell over time; "Family Trade" lost almost half of its audience between the series premiere and finale.

The series depicts interactions and negotiations between customers and staff at G. Stone Motors, a car dealership in <a href="Middlebury%2C%20Vermont">Middlebury, Vermont</a> that allows its customers to bring in anything they believe is resalable (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectible dolls) to the dealership to help cover the cost of a new or used vehicle rather than paying for it with cash. Gardner Stone, founder and owner of the dealership, explains, "I feel everything is worth something. Lots of times you'll get into the middle of a deal and the customer won't be able to go any further. So we always ask them, 'What else you got that you're not using?'" His son Todd also claims that the barter system creates deals that would otherwise not be possible: "It's helped us get some deals that we wouldn't have gotten, and most of the time we do make good money. Even if we break even, we still sold the automobile, and we made money on that."

The customers negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also with other members of the shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Gardner's son and daughter, Todd and Darcy, work with Travis to resell the items they have acquired, which is where the dealership either earns an additional profit or loses some of their earnings.


Production for "Family Trade" began when <a href="Lionsgate">Lionsgate</a> executive Eli Frankel approached the dealership in early 2011 proposing the idea of filming a reality show. The Stones initially thought the pitch was a hoax, though once they recognized the validity of the offer, Gardner agreed to do the show provided the deals aired were truly representative of how the business operates. Before the show premiered, Gardner made this desire clear, saying, "I'm very adamant about making this a legitimate thing. I can't stand these reality shows that you just know aren't right. We don't know where any of the deals are going to go prior to negotiating on the air." Todd echoed his father's desire, remarking, "He made a big point of making this a real show, not a fake show." The Stones eventually agreed to have Lionsgate film a fifteen-minute clip of various trades performed at the dealership. Lionsgate pitched the idea to a few networks, such as <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29">History</a>, but <a href="Game%20Show%20Network">Game Show Network</a> (GSN) eventually picked the series up after ordering a <a href="Television%20pilot">pilot</a> episode. David Schiff, GSN's senior vice president for programming and development, expressed excitement at the prospect of working with the Stone family: "Gardner is a great businessman, and he really goes by his gut. The variety of things that come in that door are so unique and so interesting and so much fun."

In the network's 2012 <a href="Upfront%20%28advertising%29">upfronts</a>, GSN announced plans to launch a new category of programming entitled "Real-Life Games," which would include series that "take place in real-world settings and feature real-life risk and reward, winners and losers, joy and disappointment." "Family Trade" first appeared in the network's upfronts on March 21, 2012, as a half-hour reality show under the new category, then under the title "The Family Trade". Despite this, the Stones insisted that there were no "game" aspects of the series, rather that everything seen on the show was related to business. After three test audiences gave positive reviews of the pilot, GSN proceeded to order eight episodes of the series on August 9, 2012. Filming for the eight episodes, which began September 1, lasted for around five or six weeks. The series was originally expected to premiere on March 5, 2013; on February 1, GSN pushed the premiere date back a week to March 12 (a specific reason was not given). Although the network never made an official cancelation announcement, the show has not aired on GSN since the end of the first season and is thus presumed to have been canceled.

Greg Braxton of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" considered "Family Trade" to be a "game-changer" for GSN due to the network's history of primarily airing <a href="game%20show">game show</a>s. Braxton also called the show a "key part in [GSN's] strategy to broaden its programming and brand". The day after the series premiere, Michael Tyminski of "Manhattan Digest" gave a negative review of the show, calling it "incredibly bland", and stating that it appeared to lack much of the family drama that had previously been advertised. Writing for the "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>", Neal Justin added, "The toughest sell of all [is] convincing me to watch more than one episode."

The series started off with decent television ratings by GSN's standards, averaging 403,000 viewers for the two episodes shown on the night of the show's premiere, slightly above the network's primetime viewership average. The show quickly fell in the ratings, with all new episodes airing in the first quarter averaging 296,000 viewers, and only 40,000 viewers (with a 0.0 rating) among adults 18–49. When averaged as a whole, the series dropped even lower in terms of total viewers, with an average of 274,000, and only improved by a negligible amount among adults 18–49, with 46,000 viewers (again with a 0.0 rating).

First Tennessee Park

First Tennessee Park is a <a href="baseball%20park">baseball park</a> in downtown <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, United States. The home of the <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Triple-A</a> <a href="Nashville%20Sounds">Nashville Sounds</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a> (PCL), it opened on April 17, 2015, and can seat up to 10,000 people. It replaced the Sounds' former home, <a href="Herschel%20Greer%20Stadium">Herschel Greer Stadium</a>, where the team played from its founding in 1978 until 2014.

The park was built on the site of the former <a href="Sulphur%20Dell">Sulphur Dell</a>, a minor league ballpark in use from 1870 to 1963. It is located between Third and Fifth Avenues on the east and west (home plate, the pitcher's mound, and second base are directly in line with Fourth Avenue to the stadium's north and south) and between <a href="Junior%20Gilliam">Junior Gilliam</a> Way and Harrison Street on the north and south. The Nashville skyline can be seen from the stadium to the south.

The design of the park incorporates elements of Nashville's baseball and musical heritage and the use of imagery inspired by Sulphur Dell, the city's former baseball players and teams, and <a href="country%20music">country music</a>. Its most distinctive feature is its guitar-shaped scoreboard—a successor to the original guitar scoreboard at Greer Stadium. The ballpark's wide concourse wraps entirely around the stadium and provides views of the field from every location. A <a href="greenway%20%28landscape%29">greenway</a> beyond the outfield wall connects with two other greenways in the city.

Though primarily a venue for the Nashville Sounds, other collegiate and high school baseball teams based in the area, such as the <a href="Vanderbilt%20Commodores%20baseball">Vanderbilt Commodores</a> and <a href="Belmont%20Bruins%20baseball">Belmont Bruins</a>, have played some games at First Tennessee Park. It is also home to the <a href="City%20of%20Hope%20National%20Medical%20Center">City of Hope</a> Celebrity Softball Game. Since 2018, it has been the home stadium of <a href="Nashville%20SC">Nashville SC</a>, a <a href="soccer">soccer</a> team playing in the <a href="United%20Soccer%20League%20Championship">United Soccer League Championship</a>.

As early as 2006, the <a href="Nashville%20Sounds">Nashville Sounds</a> had planned to leave <a href="Herschel%20Greer%20Stadium">Herschel Greer Stadium</a> for a new ballpark to be called <a href="First%20Tennessee%20Field">First Tennessee Field</a>, but the project was abandoned after the city, developers, and team could not come to terms on a plan to finance its construction. Instead, Greer was repaired and upgraded to keep it close to <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Triple-A</a> standards until a new stadium could be built. In late 2013, talks about the construction of a new ballpark were revived. Three possible sites were identified by the architectural firm <a href="Populous%20%28company%29">Populous</a> as being suitable for a new stadium: the east bank of the <a href="Cumberland%20River">Cumberland River</a>, the North Gulch area, and <a href="Sulphur%20Dell">Sulphur Dell</a>. Sulphur Dell, the site of the city's original ballpark from 1870 to 1963, was chosen.

Mayor <a href="Karl%20Dean">Karl Dean</a> drafted plans for financing the stadium and acquiring the necessary land from the state. The deal involved the <a href="Metropolitan%20Government%20of%20Nashville%20and%20Davidson%20County">Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County</a> (Metro) receiving the state-owned Sulphur Dell property—then in use as a parking lot for state employees—in exchange for paying the state $18 million for the construction of a 1,000-car parking garage on the site and $5 million for an underground parking garage below the proposed new state library and archives. The city also acquired the land on which the <a href="Nashville%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">Nashville School of the Arts</a> is located.

The financing plan involved public and private funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75 million for the acquisition of the land and construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91 million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30 years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group agreed to spend $50 million on a new, mixed-use and retail development located on a plot abutting the ballpark to the east. This land was sold to Chris and Tim Ward, sons of co-owner Frank Ward, on which a two-story retail center is expected to be completed by April 2019. The construction of a 285-unit multi-family apartment building beyond the left field wall, to be known as The Derby, is tentatively planned for completion in 2020, though, , construction has not begun. North of the site, Embrey Development built a privately funded 306-unit luxury apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75 million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3 million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Ward brothers' developments, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in <a href="tax%20increment%20financing">tax increment financing</a>. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.

Memphis-based bank <a href="First%20Tennessee">First Tennessee</a> purchased the naming rights to the stadium for ten years with an option for a further ten years, naming it First Tennessee Park. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. First Tennessee's name had been attached to the team's previous attempt at building a new stadium a decade earlier.

The ballpark project received the last of its necessary <a href="wiktionary%3Aapprobation">approbations</a> from the Metro Council, the State Building Commission, and the Nashville Sports Authority on December 10, 2013. Groundbreaking took place on January 27, 2014; the public ceremony was attended by Mayor Dean, Sounds owner Frank Ward, <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a> president <a href="Pat%20O%27Conner">Pat O'Conner</a>, and <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> General Manager <a href="Doug%20Melvin">Doug Melvin</a>. At the time, the Sounds were the Triple-A affiliate of the Brewers.

The construction team began site excavation on March 3, 2014. Workers excavated artifacts dating to around 1150 AD. Fire pits and broken pieces of ceramic pans were found in the ground below what would be <a href="left%20field">left field</a>. Archaeologists believe the area was the site of a <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> settlement and that the artifacts were the remnants of a workshop where mineral water from underground sulfur-bearing springs was boiled to collect salt. The artifacts are on permanent display in the <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Museum">Tennessee State Museum</a>'s <a href="Mississippian%20culture">Mississippian Period</a> exhibit. A portion of the property was used as a city cemetery in the 1800s. The interred were relocated.

Construction of the ballpark's steel frame began on August 18; of steel and of concrete were used. By November 3, the installation and testing of the stadium's four free-standing light poles and two concourse-based lighting arrays had begun. Installation of the 8,500 seats started on January 20, 2015. The guitar-shaped scoreboard began to be installed on February 23. On March 19, the home plate from Greer Stadium was transferred to First Tennessee Park, and crews began laying the sod.

During construction, the need for new water and electrical supply lines arose. Because these were not factored into the original $65 million cost, another $5 million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5 million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2 million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5 million greenway, $5.6 million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6 million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56 million and the total cost of the project to $91 million.

First Tennessee Park received <a href="Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design">LEED</a> silver certification by the <a href="U.S.%20Green%20Building%20Council">U.S. Green Building Council</a> in April 2015 for its level of environmental sustainability and for using strategies for responsible site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection, and indoor environmental quality. Some of the ballpark's environmentally friendly initiatives include a <a href="green%20roof">green roof</a> on a concessions building along right field, <a href="rainwater%20harvesting">rainwater harvesting</a>, and a <a href="rain%20garden">rain garden</a>. A section of <a href="greenway%20%28landscape%29">greenway</a> beyond the outfield wall connects the Cumberland River Greenway to the <a href="Bicentennial%20Capitol%20Mall%20State%20Park">Bicentennial Mall</a> Greenway. The project team also diverted or recycled 90 percent of construction waste from landfills, and almost a third of building materials were regionally sourced.

In the ballpark's inaugural game on April 17, 2015, the Sounds defeated the <a href="Colorado%20Springs%20Sky%20Sox">Colorado Springs Sky Sox</a>, 3–2 in 10 innings, courtesy of a <a href="walk-off%20win">walk-off</a> <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a> hit by <a href="Max%20Muncy">Max Muncy</a> that scored <a href="Billy%20Burns%20%28baseball%29">Billy Burns</a> from first base. Nashville pitcher <a href="Arnold%20Le%C3%B3n">Arnold León</a> recorded the first <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a> at First Tennessee Park when Colorado Springs' Matt Long struck out swinging as the <a href="leadoff%20hitter">leadoff hitter</a> at the top of the first inning. The park's first <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a> was a left field <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">single</a> that came in the top of the second inning off the bat of Colorado Springs' <a href="Matt%20Clark%20%28baseball%29">Matt Clark</a>. Clark also recorded the stadium's first <a href="run%20batted%20in">RBI</a>, slapping a single to center field in the fourth inning that sent <a href="Luis%20Sardi%C3%B1as">Luis Sardiñas</a> across the plate for the park's first <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">run</a>. The first <a href="home%20run">home run</a> in the park's history was hit by Nashville's <a href="Joey%20Wendle">Joey Wendle</a> four games later on April 21 against the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20Dodgers">Oklahoma City Dodgers</a>.

Tickets for the home opener, which went on sale March 23, sold out in approximately 15 minutes. Though <a href="berm">berm</a> and standing-room-only tickets are normally sold only on the day of games, the team began selling these in advance of the first game due to high demand. Paid attendance for the first game was a standing-room only crowd of 10,459. Before the game, Mayor Dean threw out the ceremonial first pitch. "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>" was performed by <a href="Chip%20Esten">Charles Esten</a> (a star of the television series "<a href="Nashville%20%282012%20TV%20series%29">Nashville</a>"), who also sang at the park's <a href="ribbon-cutting%20ceremony">ribbon-cutting ceremony</a> earlier in the day. Also present at the ribbon-cutting were team owners Masahiro Honzawa and Frank Ward, <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a> president <a href="Branch%20Barrett%20Rickey">Branch B. Rickey</a>, <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> president <a href="Michael%20Crowley%20%28baseball%29">Michael Crowley</a>, Mayor Dean, and members of the Metro Council who voted to approve financing for the stadium. The Sounds were, at this time, the Triple-A affiliate of the Athletics.

By the <a href="Triple-A%20All-Star%20Game">all-star break</a> in mid-July, attendance had reached 332,604, a higher attendance than in the entire 2014 season at Greer Stadium, which had totaled 323,961 people over 66 games. At the end of the 71-game 2015 season, 565,548 people had attended a game at First Tennessee Park, for an average attendance of 7,965 per game, compared to 4,909 per game for the last season at Greer. The ballpark's attendance record was set two years later, when on July 3, 2017, 11,764 people watched the Sounds play against the Oklahoma City Dodgers on the night of the team's <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> celebration, a 6–5 Sounds loss.

In addition to other between-innings entertainment at the park, such as games and giveaways, the Sounds added the Country Legends Race in 2016. It is similar to major league <a href="mascot%20race">mascot race</a>s, such as the <a href="Sausage%20Race">Sausage Race</a> and <a href="Presidents%20Race">Presidents Race</a>. Each game during the middle of the fifth inning, people in oversized foam caricature costumes depicting country musicians <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a>, <a href="George%20Jones">George Jones</a>, <a href="Reba%20McEntire">Reba McEntire</a>, and <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a> race around the warning track from center field, through the visiting bullpen, and to the home plate side of the first base dugout.

First Tennessee Park was home to its first postseason baseball in 2016 when the Sounds competed in games three, four, and five of the Pacific Coast League American Conference championship against Oklahoma City. The Sounds won the first game, 6–5, but lost the next two games and the conference championship to the Dodgers, 7–1 and 10–9.

The Sounds will host the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a>, their <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) affiliate, at First Tennessee Park for an exhibition game on March 24, 2019. This will be the first MLB exhibition game held in Nashville since 1999 at Greer Stadium.

<a href="Nashville%20SC">Nashville SC</a>, an expansion <a href="Association%20football">soccer</a> team of the <a href="USL%20Championship">United Soccer League</a>, entered into a one-year agreement to play its inaugural 2018 season at First Tennessee Park. The club competed in a preseason exhibition <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS) match against <a href="Atlanta%20United%20FC">Atlanta United FC</a> on February 10, 2018, in the first-ever soccer match played at the park. Nashville was defeated amid a rainstorm by Atlanta, 3–1, in front of a crowd of 9,059 people. The park's first goal was scored by Atlanta <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a> <a href="Josef%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Josef Martínez</a> in the 58th minute. <a href="Ropapa%20Mensah">Ropapa Mensah</a>, the youngest player on the Nashville squad, scored the first goal in Nashville SC franchise history in the 64th minute. Nashville's first regular season home match, scheduled for March 24 versus the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Riverhounds">Pittsburgh Riverhounds</a>, was moved to <a href="Nissan%20Stadium">Nissan Stadium</a> in order to accommodate a greater number of fans. Their second home match was played at First Tennessee Park on April 7 against the <a href="Charlotte%20Independence">Charlotte Independence</a> before a crowd of 7,487. Nashville SC won, 2–0, on forward <a href="Alan%20Winn">Alan Winn</a>'s goal in the 24th minute; Mensah added a second goal in the 91st minute. The team's highest attendance occurred on October 13 when 9,083 fans watched Nashville play to a 3–3 draw versus <a href="FC%20Cincinnati%20%282016%E2%80%9318%29">FC Cincinnati</a> in the season finale. At First Tennessee Park, Nashville SC's 2018 season attendance totaled 125,390 over 15 games, with an average attendance of 8,359 per game. In preparation for playing their entire 2019 schedule at the park, they competed in a preseason friendly against MLS side <a href="New%20York%20City%20FC">New York City FC</a> on February 22. Nashville fell to New York, 2–0, in the rain-soaked match attended by 5,384.

First Tennessee Park began hosting the annual <a href="City%20of%20Hope%20National%20Medical%20Center">City of Hope</a> Celebrity Softball Game in 2015. Started in 1990, the event is played during the <a href="CMA%20Music%20Festival">CMA Music Festival</a> held in Nashville, and was previously held at Herschel Greer Stadium from 1991 to 2014. Two teams of country music stars representing the <a href="Grand%20Ole%20Opry">Grand Ole Opry</a> and <a href="iHeartRadio">iHeartRadio</a> compete in the game with all proceeds going to fund the research and treatment of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, and other life-threatening diseases. Past participants have included <a href="Carrie%20Underwood">Carrie Underwood</a>, <a href="Darius%20Rucker">Darius Rucker</a>, <a href="Florida%20Georgia%20Line">Florida Georgia Line</a>, <a href="Jason%20Aldean">Jason Aldean</a>, <a href="Luke%20Bryan">Luke Bryan</a>, and <a href="Vince%20Gill">Vince Gill</a>. Over $200,000 was raised from the first game held at the park.

On March 29, 2016, the <a href="Vanderbilt%20Commodores%20baseball">Vanderbilt Commodores</a> and <a href="Belmont%20Bruins%20baseball">Belmont Bruins</a> became the first collegiate teams to play at the facility. The Commodores defeated the Bruins, 8–2, in front of a crowd of 3,782 people. Vanderbilt, Belmont, and the <a href="Lipscomb%20Bisons">Lipscomb Bisons</a> have since played subsequent games at the venue. The park also hosted a few <a href="Reviving%20Baseball%20in%20Inner%20Cities">Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities</a> youth games in its first season. Since 2016, the course of the <a href="Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%20Nashville%20Marathon">Rock 'n' Roll Nashville Marathon</a> has led runners to complete a lap around the field's warning track. The first non-sports event held at First Tennessee Park was the Nashville Brew Festival, held on October 3, 2015. The festival featured over 50 breweries offering unlimited beer with paid admission. On July 16, 2016, the park hosted the first "Big Guitar Brewfest", a name which refers to the ballpark's large guitar-shaped scoreboard, featuring over fifty local and craft breweries, four liquor sampling tents, and food from The Band Box and concession stands. It has come to be an annual event.

The Nashville-based American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Kings%20of%20Leon">Kings of Leon</a>, with opener <a href="Dawes%20%28band%29">Dawes</a>, performed at First Tennessee Park on September 29, 2017, in the first concert held in the ballpark.

After Sulphur Dell was dismantled on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken field was filled in with rock, dirt, and the remains of the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade at the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed.

The grandstand has a wide concourse that wraps around the playing field. The field is recessed below the street-level concourse so it can be viewed from the entrances and seats. Most of the on-field action can be viewed from the concourse; televisions showing live feeds of the game are located there. The seating bowl provides views of Nashville's skyline to the south.

The ballpark was built to withstand a <a href="100-year%20flood">100-year flood</a> because it is located on a <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a>. Before its redevelopment, the area, including the original Sulphur Dell ballpark, was prone to regular flooding from the nearby Cumberland River and it flooded during the <a href="2010%20Tennessee%20floods">2010 Tennessee floods</a>. To prevent water damage, the grandstand has an <a href="Acrylic%20resin">acrylic</a> floor covering and the field-level suites are equipped with detachable floor boards, food-service tables mounted on casters, and raised floor outlets and electrical switches.

The ballpark's design is inspired by Nashville's heritage, as design elements throughout the park incorporate musical and baseball imagery to connect the park with the city's past. Directional signs are accompanied by information about former Nashville players such as <a href="Al%20Maul">Al Maul</a>, <a href="Tom%20Rogers%20%28baseball%29">Tom Rogers</a>, and <a href="Turkey%20Stearnes">Turkey Stearnes</a>. The park's suites include displays about Sulphur Dell, the <a href="Nashville%20Vols">Nashville Vols</a>, a minor league team that played there from 1901 to 1961, and in 1963, and other past teams from Nashville. The back of the outfield wall's green metal <a href="batter%27s%20eye">batter's eye</a> has a tin sign marking the former location of Sulphur Dell's marquee declaring, "Site of Sulphur Dell, Baseball's Most Historic Park, 1870–1963". A series of nine vertical panels on the right field greenway provide information on the history of baseball in Nashville from the 1860s through 1963. Another five panels beyond left field detail facts about the prehistory of the site. Light stanchions in the grandstand and the outfield resemble the lights installed at Sulphur Dell. Details including <a href="guitar%20pick">guitar pick</a>-shaped seating signage and the use of the Sounds' colors identify the ballpark with Nashville's country music heritage and reflect the visual identity of the team.

Before the ballpark's second season in 2016, additional safety netting was added behind home plate which extended the protective netting to cover the seating area behind both dugouts. Other additions to the ballpark included six ceiling fans on the concourse, new drinking fountains and water bottle filling stations, the opening of a center field entrance adjacent to the new parking garage beyond right-center field, and improvements to the children's fun zone on the first base side.

The playing surface at First Tennessee Park is covered with of <a href="Cynodon%20dactylon">Bermuda Tifway 419 grass</a> sod that was grown on a farm in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, then over-seeded with of <a href="Lolium%20perenne">perennial rye-grass</a>. Over of <a href="red%20clay">red clay</a> infield soil was brought in from <a href="Laceys%20Spring%2C%20Alabama">Laceys Spring, Alabama</a>. The <a href="warning%20track">warning track</a> surrounding the field is made of of crushed red shale on top of of sand and of gravel. The field is equipped with a drainage system capable of draining of water per hour.

The distance from <a href="home%20plate">home plate</a> to the <a href="Baseball%20field%23Outfield%20wall">outfield wall</a> ranges from in left field, in center field, and in right field. First Tennessee Park's right field wall was set at this shorter-than-normal distance to pay homage to Sulphur Dell's short right field fence that measured just . The <a href="backstop%20%28baseball%29">backstop</a> is approximately behind the home plate. The field is set below the street-level concourse.

The <a href="dugout%20%28baseball%29">dugouts</a>, which measure by , are large enough to accommodate each team's staff without the need for <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief pitcher</a>s to sit in the <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a>s. The Sounds' dugout is located on the third-base side; the visiting team's is located on the first-base side. Bullpens are located in <a href="foul%20territory">foul territory</a> along the left-field and right-field lines near the corner of the outfield wall. The home clubhouse has wooden lockers, two couches, three card tables, and a center table. There is an attached kitchen with two full-size refrigerators and room for hot and cold catering. Other player amenities include large, indoor batting cages, a fully equipped workout room, and a family room for players' partners and children. In 2016, the <a href="umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpire</a> dressing room was named after former <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> umpire and Nashville native <a href="Chuck%20Meriwether">Chuck Meriwether</a>.

In its first season, First Tennessee Park developed a reputation as a <a href="pitcher%27s%20park">pitcher's park</a>. In 2015, its <a href="batting%20park%20factor">park factors</a> were significantly lower than those at other ballparks in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and across Triple-A baseball. The park had the lowest run and home-run factors of all 30 Triple-A teams, and its hits factor was the fifth-lowest in Triple-A and the fourth-lowest in the PCL. In 2016, the park had the lowest home-run factors in Triple-A, its runs factor was the sixth-lowest in Triple-A and fifth-lowest in the PCL, and its hits factor was the seventh-lowest in Triple-A and the sixth-lowest in the PCL.

The park was selected to win the 2016 Tennessee Turfgrass Association's Professional Sports Field of the Year Award, recognizing it as the state's top professional sports field with a natural grass playing surface.

When configured for soccer, one side of the field runs parallel to the first base line with the other sideline running from left to right field. One goal is located past the third base dugout, and the other is near the right-center field wall. The pitcher's mound is removed, and the infield dirt and portions of the warning track are sodded over. The pitch measures .

One of Greer Stadium's most distinctive features was its guitar-shaped scoreboard. After First Tennessee Park was approved, the team announced it would not be relocating the original Greer scoreboard, which was technologically outdated and difficult to maintain, to the new stadium. While plans for First Tennessee Park's scoreboard were initially undisclosed, following overwhelming support for Greer's guitar from the community, the team announced plans for a larger, more modern guitar-shaped scoreboard for the new ballpark. The new guitar scoreboard, paid for entirely by the Sounds, was designed by TS Sports in conjunction with <a href="Panasonic">Panasonic</a>, and was installed beyond the right-center field wall on the concourse.

The scoreboard, which has a <a href="High-definition%20video">high definition</a> <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> screen, is located in the middle of the concourse; visitors entering or leaving the park through the stadium's right-field entrance on Fifth Avenue pass under it. Excluding the neck and the borders of the body and headstock, the surface of the guitar is composed of LED screens. Overall, the guitar measures , its body display is , the headstock display is , and the six tuning pegs are each. Whereas the scoreboard at Greer was capable of displaying only basic in-game information such as the <a href="Box%20score%20%28baseball%29">line score</a>, <a href="count%20%28baseball%29">count</a>, and brief player statistics, the new version can display colorful graphics and animations, photographs, live and recorded video, <a href="instant%20replay">instant replay</a>s, the <a href="batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">batting order</a>, <a href="Baseball%20positioning">fielding positions</a>, and expanded statistics.

As well as the main scoreboard, the ballpark has three more LED displays. A display in the left-center field wall is used for showing in-game pitching statistics, upcoming batters, and advertisements. LED ribbon boards are installed on the facings of each side of the upper deck; these are used to display the inning, score, count, and advertisements. The stadium's three pitch clocks—part of professional baseball's pace-of-game initiatives implemented in Triple-A and Double-A baseball games in 2015— are located on the straightaway center field wall and on each side of the backstop.

The lower seating bowl is divided into 24 sections and wraps around the playing field from one <a href="foul%20pole">foul pole</a> to the other. The second level has 16 sections of seating that begin behind <a href="third%20base">third base</a> and wrap around to <a href="first%20base">first base</a>. The last nine rows, from row M, on the first level between the dugouts are sheltered by the upper deck. Seats on both levels are traditional, plastic stadium-style chairs. All lower-level seats behind home plate, seats behind and between the dugouts through row P, and all second-level seats have padded seat cushions. Seats in the three center upper-deck sections behind home plate and all second-level suites also have padded seat backs. A grass berm that can accommodate 1,500 spectators is located beyond the left-center field wall.

The park has several areas reserved for small and large groups. Four field-level suites, each with 33 exterior seats and additional interior space to accommodate up to 50 people, are located directly behind home plate. The second level has 18 suites, each accommodating up to 24 people, with 4 indoor drink rail seats and 13 outdoor seats in front. Two covered party decks are located on the second level—one at each end—both of which can accommodate up to 75 people each. Between the end of the lower seating bowl in left field and the outfield berm lies a group area which can accommodate up to 600 individuals. This area consists of a covered picnic area, round picnic tables, rearrangeable chairs, and the stadium seats of sections 101 to 104. A section of 4-top tables—semi-circular tables surrounded by four chairs—that can accommodate 108 people at 27 tables is located at the end of the lower seating bowl in <a href="right%20field">right field</a> near a specialty concession area called The Band Box. A small private party area is located in the power alley in front of The Band Box and can accommodate up to 35 people at 4-top tables. Next to this, and directly in front of the scoreboard, is a 200-person group picnic area with standing room and stadium seats with drink rails.

Four permanent concession stands and several portable carts located on the concourse offer traditional ballpark foods including hot dogs, <a href="corn%20dog">corn dog</a>s, pizza, <a href="nachos">nachos</a>, soft pretzels, popcorn, and ice cream. Each stand also serves foods unique to and common in Nashville and the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>, including <a href="Nashville%20hot%20chicken">Nashville hot chicken</a>, <a href="pulled%20pork">pulled pork</a> <a href="barbecue">barbecue</a> sandwiches, and <a href="baby%20back%20ribs">baby back ribs</a>. The stadium's second level has a bar, lounge, and concessions area with views of the field; it is accessible only by those with suite, party-deck, or upper-deck tickets. Certain menu items, such as <a href="prime%20rib">prime rib</a> tacos, <a href="slider%20%28sandwich%29">sliders</a>, and onion rings are only available on the second level.

Another specialty concession area is The Band Box, a outdoor restaurant and bar located on the right field concourse. The restaurant serves variations on traditional ballpark foods including cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, <a href="jalape%C3%B1o">jalapeño</a> <a href="corn%20fritter">corn fritter</a>s, smoked chicken nachos, <a href="quinoa">quinoa</a> chopped salads, and local draft <a href="craft%20beer">craft beer</a>. It is accompanied by a 150-person bar to its rear overlooking right field. The bar has an adjoining lounge area with couches, televisions, <a href="ping%20pong">ping pong</a>, <a href="cornhole">cornhole</a>, <a href="foosball">foosball</a>, and <a href="shuffleboard">shuffleboard</a>, which is open to all game ticket-holders. Patrons in the adjacent 4-top seating section can order food and drinks from The Band Box and have items delivered to their seats. On June 28, 2016, a 9-hole <a href="miniature%20golf">miniature golf</a> course, called The Country Club at The Band Box, opened behind the restaurant between the bar and Fifth Avenue. Each of the nine holes exhibits art from different local or regional artists. It is open to game attendees for an additional $5 playing fee.

A 1,000-car above-ground parking garage, owned by the state, is located south of the stadium's center field and right field entrances on Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. As the garage is used by state employees during the day, game attendees are only able to use it for evening and weekend games. Other state-owned free parking lots and paid private lots are located in the vicinity. The <a href="Nashville%20Metropolitan%20Transit%20Authority">Metro Transit Authority</a>'s Music City Circuit provides bus service to and from a drop-off site at Fifth Avenue and Harrison Street. Nashville <a href="BCycle">BCycle</a>, the city's bike-share program, has a station at First Tennessee Park.

First Tennessee Park's single-game attendance record was set on July 3, 2017, on the night of the Sounds' Independence Day celebration when the team took on the Oklahoma City Dodgers in front of a sellout crowd of 11,764 people. The park's season attendance record of 603,135 was set in 2018, while its average attendance record (8,861) was set in 2017. Five of the top-ten highest-attended games occurred in 2017. There have been 75 sellout games at the stadium. Attendance records through the completion of the 2018 season are as follows.

The Demi-Virgin

The Demi-Virgin is a three-<a href="act%20%28drama%29">act</a> <a href="play%20%28theatre%29">play</a> written by <a href="Avery%20Hopwood">Avery Hopwood</a>. Producer <a href="Albert%20H.%20Woods">Albert H. Woods</a> staged it on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>, where it was a hit during the 1921–22 season. The play is a <a href="bedroom%20farce">bedroom farce</a> about former couple Gloria Graham and Wally Deane, both movie actors, whose marriage was so brief that the press speculated about whether Gloria was still a virgin. She attempts to seduce Wally when they are forced to reunite for a movie, but after playing along he surprises her by revealing that their <a href="divorce">divorce</a> is not valid.

Because it contained suggestive dialogue and the female cast wore revealing clothes, the production was considered highly risqué at the time. The script alluded to a contemporary <a href="Roscoe%20Arbuckle%23The%20scandal">scandal</a> involving actor <a href="Roscoe%20Arbuckle">Fatty Arbuckle</a>, and one scene featured actresses stripping as part of a card game. Reviewers generally panned the play as unfunny and vulgar, and local authorities attempted to <a href="Censorship%20in%20the%20United%20States">censor</a> it. A New York City magistrate ruled the Broadway production was <a href="obscenity">obscene</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20obscenity%20law">obscenity charges</a> were brought against Woods, but a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> declined to <a href="indictment">indict</a> him. The city's Commissioner of Licenses attempted to revoke the theater's license, but this effort was blocked in court. Woods promoted the controversy to increase ticket sales, and the play was one of the most successful of the season. It had no long-term literary impact and was never published, but it did stimulate arguments over <a href="theatrical%20constraints">censorship of theatrical performances</a>.

The story centers on the character Gloria Graham, a <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> actress who had previously been married to fellow actor Wally Deane. After he received a late-night call on their wedding night from a former girlfriend, Gloria stormed out and went to <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno, Nevada</a> to <a href="Nevada%23Divorce">obtain a divorce</a>. The brevity of the union leads <a href="gossip%20columnist">gossip columnist</a>s to speculate about whether the marriage was <a href="consummation">consummated</a>. They label Gloria the "demi-virgin". The first act opens with a group of actresses, including Cora Montague and Betty Wilson, filming a scene for a movie and gossiping about the failed marriage. Betty's aunt Zeffie comes to the studio with a magazine article about how the couple has been forced to reunite to complete the movie, for which they were contracted before their break-up. When they arrive for filming, Gloria claims Sir Gerald Sydney has proposed to her. In an act of jealousy, Wally lies and says he is engaged to Betty. Betty is actually interested in another actor, Chicky Belden, although her aunt disapproves of him. The first act culminates with Gloria and Wally being required to film a love scene together.

The second act takes place a week later, when the movie's cast are attending a decadent party at Gloria's house. Wally and Chicky have conspired to use the phony engagement of Betty and Wally to win Zeffie's approval of the real relationship between Betty and Chicky. They think she will find Wally so unacceptable that Chicky will seem good in comparison. Meanwhile, Gloria also wants to prove Wally is an unfit match for Betty, by seducing him to prove that he is unfaithful. She lures Wally to her bedroom suite on the pretense of renewing their relationship, without intending to follow through. She plans to tease him until Zeffie finds them there, but he is prepared for her plan and will not accept any delay; the act ends with him telling her that she must fulfill her "marriage debt" to him.

The third act continues in Gloria's bedroom suite. In the play's most controversial scene, a group of actresses enter the room while Wally hides in another room of the suite. They decide to play "Stripping Cupid", a card-based <a href="strip%20game">strip game</a>, and remove pieces of clothing onstage. One of them, Dot Madison, is down to her last two items of clothing when Wally returns to the room. The actresses leave, and Wally says he is going to get his bag so he has it the next morning. While he is out of the room, Zeffie enters. Gloria asks Zeffie to hide in the bed, so when Wally returns she will see his advances firsthand. In a final <a href="plot%20twist">plot twist</a>, when Wally returns he has a telegram from his lawyer revealing that the Reno divorce is not valid. Gloria and Wally reconcile, and Zeffie gives her approval to the relationship between Betty and Chicky.

For the role of Gloria Graham, producer <a href="Albert%20H.%20Woods">Albert H. Woods</a> cast <a href="Hazel%20Dawn">Hazel Dawn</a>, who was then starring in his production of "<a href="Getting%20Gertie%27s%20Garter%20%28play%29">Getting Gertie's Garter</a>". She had previously starred in another Woods-produced bedroom farce, "<a href="Up%20in%20Mabel%27s%20Room%20%28play%29">Up in Mabel's Room</a>". Dawn left the cast in March 1922 and was replaced by <a href="Belle%20Bennett">Belle Bennett</a>.

The characters and cast from the Broadway production are listed below:

Prior to writing "The Demi-Virgin", Hopwood was a well-established author of bedroom comedies. His past efforts in the genre included "<a href="Fair%20and%20Warmer">Fair and Warmer</a>", produced by <a href="Edgar%20Selwyn">Edgar Selwyn</a> in 1915, and "<a href="The%20Gold%20Diggers%20%281919%20play%29">The Gold Diggers</a>", produced by <a href="David%20Belasco">David Belasco</a> in 1919. Producer Albert H. Woods had an even longer track record in the genre, starting with "<a href="The%20Girl%20from%20Rector%27s">The Girl from Rector's</a>" in 1909. Such material had been very profitable for Woods, who commissioned originals and adapted foreign farces, and for Hopwood, who was one of the most successful authors in the genre. Their first work together was "<a href="The%20Girl%20in%20the%20Limousine%20%28play%29">The Girl in the Limousine</a>" in 1919, which Hopwood revised from an earlier script by <a href="Wilson%20Collison">Wilson Collison</a>. Hopwood then helped revise "<a href="Ladies%27%20Night%20%28play%29">Ladies' Night</a>" in 1920 and "Getting Gertie's Garter" in 1921. "The Demi-Virgin" was Hopwood's first play written for Woods without a collaborator. Hopwood was inspired by an earlier theatrical adaptation of "Les Demi-vierges", an 1894 novel by the French writer <a href="Marcel%20Pr%C3%A9vost">Marcel Prévost</a> that had been dramatized in 1895, but used little from it beyond the title.

Hopwood's completion of "The Demi-Virgin" coincided with a scandal involving Hollywood actor <a href="Roscoe%20Arbuckle">Fatty Arbuckle</a>, who was accused of <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> after the death of a young actress, <a href="Virginia%20Rappe">Virginia Rappe</a>, happened at one of his parties (Arbuckle was widely seen as innocent, and was eventually acquitted). Although the play was largely written before the scandal broke, Hopwood incorporated references to Arbuckle in the first produced version of the script, through a character called "Fatty Belden". These references were toned down after <a href="preview%20%28theatre%29">preview</a> audiences reacted poorly, and the character was renamed "Chicky Belden".

Prior to its Broadway debut, preview performances of the play were staged in several cities. The first was in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, where it began a scheduled one-week run on September 26, 1921. It was closed early on the last day by the local Director of Public Safety, who objected to some of the dialogue. Hopwood was upset by the censorship, but Woods was happy to have free publicity from press coverage of the closure. The tryouts then moved to <a href="Stamford%2C%20Connecticut">Stamford, Connecticut</a> and <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>, where they proceeded without incident. The play's Broadway opening was at the <a href="Times%20Square%20Theatre">Times Square Theatre</a> on October 18, 1921. It ran there for a few weeks until Woods transferred it to his own <a href="Eltinge%2042nd%20Street%20Theatre">Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre</a> on November 7.

On November 3, 1921, Woods and Hopwood were called to the chambers of <a href="William%20McAdoo%20%28New%20Jersey%20politician%29">William McAdoo</a>, the <a href="Chief%20Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</a> of the New York City magistrates' court, to respond to complaints about the play. Woods would not make any changes to address the complaints, so a formal hearing began on November 7. Woods was represented by famed attorney <a href="Max%20Steuer">Max Steuer</a>, who was also a co-owner of the Eltinge Theatre. The witnesses against the show included <a href="John%20S.%20Sumner">John S. Sumner</a>, executive secretary of the <a href="New%20York%20Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">New York Society for the Suppression of Vice</a>, and Edward J. McGuire, vice-chairman of the <a href="Committee%20of%20Fourteen">Committee of Fourteen</a>. On November 14, McAdoo ruled that the play was obscene, describing it as "coarsely indecent, flagrantly and suggestively immoral, impure in word and action". Woods was placed on <a href="bail">bail</a>, and the case was referred to the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Criminal%20Court%23History">Court of Special Sessions</a> for a <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charge of staging an obscene exhibition. Woods successfully requested that the case be transferred to the Court of General Sessions, which provided <a href="jury%20trial">jury trial</a>s and required an <a href="indictment">indictment</a> by a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a>. He was accused of violating section 1140a of the New York state penal law, which prohibited involvement in "any obscene, indecent, immoral or impure drama, play, exhibition, show or entertainment". The grand jury heard the case on December 23, 1921, but dismissed it that same day, even though they had heard only witnesses favoring the prosecution.

As the obscenity case proceeded, the city's Commissioner of Licenses, John Gilchrist, informed Woods on November 22 that he found the play "indecent and subversive of public morals" and would revoke the theater's operating license if the production continued. Gilchrist's effort failed when a <a href="New%20York%20Supreme%20Court%2C%20Appellate%20Division">New York state appeals court</a> ruled on February 20, 1922 that he did not have the legal authority to revoke a theater license once it had been granted.

After the Broadway production ended on June 3, 1922, Woods launched four road companies to present the play in other cities. The tour continued through 1923, with productions in cities such as Albany, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington.

Contemporary reviews were generally negative. Many reviewers condemned the play as immoral due to its sexual situations and suggestive dialogue. The costumes of its female cast members, who mostly wore revealing gowns or scanty bedroom attire, also attracted attention. A few reviewers complimented the cast for being attractive and fashionable. Others considered their clothing inappropriately risqué, especially in the "Stripping Cupid" scene. A reviewer for the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post</a>" described the preview production as "reeking with indecencies". The reviewer for the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Evening Post</a>" gave the Broadway production only three sentences, claiming that there was no need for "wasting space" on the repulsive "concoction" created by Hopwood and Woods. Drama critic <a href="George%20Jean%20Nathan">George Jean Nathan</a> called the play "trash". <a href="Dorothy%20Parker">Dorothy Parker</a> quipped that Dawn had "gone from bed to worse" by being in the production. The reviewer for "Brooklyn Life" said it shocked the audience from beginning to end with more frequency than a <a href="American%20burlesque">burlesque show</a>. In "<a href="The%20Evening%20World">The Evening World</a>", Charles Darnton also compared the show to "cheap burlesque", saying it was filled with "old jokes" but few laughs.

Some critics said that the play's reputation for immorality was overstated, contending it was harmless or even boring. A reviewer writing for "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28New%20York%29">The Sun</a>", for example, said it was "not as shocking as Manager Woods would like theatre goers to believe", while a review in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Clipper">The New York Clipper</a>" said that the plot was more pure than the realities of Hollywood and relied on "sweet little risque 'bits' and a super-abundance of suggestive lines" to keep audience interest. In "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", Percy Hammond described it as entertaining, saying Hopwood had "never been wittier". <a href="Burns%20Mantle">Burns Mantle</a> said Hopwood and Woods had substituted uninteresting stripping and lewd dialogue for better plotting and humor.

Critics' concerns did not stop the play from being a box office success. Several reviewers anticipated that focusing on the play's salacious content would increase patronage. Woods exploited the controversy over the play's content in his advertisements for it. When he was taken to court, "The New York Times" decided Woods could no longer use the name of the play in any ads placed with the paper. Woods worked around the problem by promoting the large number of people who had seen an unnamed production at his theater, with daily updates of the total. In ads where he could mention the name, he traded on its reputation with suggestive taglines, such as one inviting audiences to "complete your education" by seeing the play. Some ads suggested the reader should see the play to stay informed, because there was widespread discussion of it. In other ads, it was declared "the most famous play in America".

News coverage of legal actions also provided considerable free publicity. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" reported that lines for the Broadway production stretched around the corner after it was condemned in the magistrates' court. Before the court proceedings, the play was earning about $12,000 per week. After proceedings began, the box office increased to $14,000–15,000 per week, which "Variety" described as near the theater's capacity. Woods added matinees and increased the top ticket prices; the weekly box office reached over $17,000 at the end of November. By the time the production closed, it was one of the most successful of that season, having sold over 200,000 tickets across 268 performances.

"The Demi-Virgin", like most of Hopwood's farces, was commercially successful, but had no lasting literary significance. Even as a popular entertainment, the play's appeal was limited by cultural context. Before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, in a time with more conservative sexual mores, the production would have been more likely to be suppressed. A decade later, the sexual attitudes conveyed in the play would be considered too unsophisticated for Broadway. As early as the end of 1921, Woods was suggesting a seven-year hiatus in the production of bedroom farces, saying the genre had become stale. In 1925, Hopwood confessed to the audience at another play that he thought "The Demi-Virgin" was boring and that he was tired of writing faddish entertainment. The play's script was never published and no movie adaptation was made.

The legal battle over whether "The Demi-Virgin" was obscene gave new impetus to ongoing controversies about censorship. Conservatives called for new anti-obscenity legislation, while their opponents warned of the dangers of state censorship. Sumner had previously promoted a plan to create citizen-led "play juries" that would review and censor productions. When city officials were unable to shut down "The Demi-Virgin", the play jury idea was revived as a compromise between city officials, who wanted a way to rein in what they saw as uncontrolled smut, and producers, who feared that new censorship laws might be enacted. Among producers, the legal victories achieved by Woods also suggested new opportunities. In 1923, Broadway producer <a href="Earl%20Carroll">Earl Carroll</a> began his "Vanities" <a href="revue">revue</a>, featuring dozens of women in costumes considered daring at the time. Later that same year, <a href="Jacob%20J.%20Shubert">J. J. Shubert</a> opened a revue called "<a href="Artists%20and%20Models%20%28revue%29">Artists and Models</a>", which included an act with topless female models. The explicitness of the revues drew censors' focus away from the innuendo of bedroom farces. Woods later said that in comparison to these revues, he had "never produced an off-color show". The play juries proved unwilling to take the strong anti-obscenity action that Sumner and his colleagues wanted; by 1927 the system had been abandoned in favor of renewed efforts at government regulation.

Flora of Madagascar

The flora of Madagascar consists of more than 12,000 <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular</a> and <a href="non-vascular%20plant">non-vascular plant</a>s and a lesser known number of <a href="fungi">fungi</a>. Around 83% of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>'s vascular plants are only found on the island. These <a href="endemic">endemic</a>s include five plant <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">families</a>, 85% of the over 900 <a href="orchid">orchid</a> species, around 200 species of <a href="palm%20%28plant%29">palm</a>s, and such emblematic species as the <a href="traveller%27s%20tree">traveller's tree</a>, six species of <a href="baobab">baobab</a> and the <a href="Madagascar%20periwinkle">Madagascar periwinkle</a>. The high degree of endemism is due to Madagascar's long isolation following its separation from the African and Indian landmasses in the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>, 150–160 and 84–91 million years ago, respectively. However, few plant lineages remain from the ancient <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>n flora; most <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> plant groups immigrated via across-ocean <a href="biological%20dispersal">dispersal</a> well after continental break-up.

After its continental separation, Madagascar probably experienced a dry period, and <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s expanded only later in the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> to <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> when rainfall increased. Today, humid forests, including the <a href="Madagascar%20lowland%20forests">lowland forests</a>, are mainly found on the eastern plateau where abundant rainfall from the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> is captured by an <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a>. A large part of the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">central highlands</a>, in the <a href="Madagascar%20subhumid%20forests">sub-humid forests ecoregion</a>, is today dominated by <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s. They are widely seen as result of human landscape transformation but some may be more ancient. Grassland occurs in a mosaic with woodland and bushland, including "<a href="Uapaca%20bojeri">tapia</a>" forest, and <a href="Madagascar%20ericoid%20thickets">hard-leaved thickets</a> on the high mountains. <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forest">Dry forest</a> and <a href="Madagascar%20succulent%20woodlands">succulent woodland</a> are found in the drier western part and grade into the unique <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny thicket</a> in the southwest, where rainfall is lowest and the <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a> shortest. <a href="Madagascar%20mangroves">Mangroves</a> occur on the west coast, and a variety of <a href="wetland">wetland</a> habitats with an adapted flora are found across the island.

The first human presence in Madagascar dates only 2000–4000 years back, and settlement in the interior occurred centuries later. The <a href="Malagasy%20people">Malagasy people</a> have used the native flora for various purposes, including food, construction, and medicine. Exotic plants were introduced by early settlers, later traders and <a href="French%20Madagascar">French colonialists</a>, and many have become important to <a href="Agriculture%20in%20Madagascar">agriculture</a>. Among them are <a href="rice">rice</a>, the staple dish of <a href="Malagasy%20cuisine">Malagasy cuisine</a> grown in <a href="terraces%20%28agriculture%29">terraced fields</a> in the highlands, and <a href="greater%20yam">greater yam</a>, <a href="taro">taro</a>, <a href="cowpea">cowpea</a>, and <a href="Cooking%20banana">plantain</a>. Plantation crops include <a href="litchi">litchi</a>, <a href="cloves">cloves</a>, <a href="coffee">coffee</a>, and <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a>, the latter one of the country's main export produce today. More than 1,300 introduced plants are known, of which around 600 have become naturalised, and some <a href="invasive%20species">invasive</a>.

Human population growth and economic activity have put pressure on natural vegetation in the region, especially through <a href="deforestation%20in%20Madagascar">massive deforestation</a>. Madagascar's high <a href="endemism">endemism</a> and species richness coupled with a sharp decrease in primary vegetation make the island a global <a href="biodiversity%20hotspot">biodiversity hotspot</a>. To preserve natural habitats, around 10% of the land surface <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20Madagascar">is protected</a>, including the <a href="World%20Heritage">World Heritage</a> sites <a href="Tsingy%20de%20Bemaraha">Tsingy de Bemaraha</a> and the <a href="Rainforests%20of%20the%20Atsinanana">Rainforests of the Atsinanana</a>. While historically mainly French naturalists described Madagascar's flora, today a number of national and international herbaria, botanical gardens and universities document plant diversity and engage in its <a href="conservation%20biology">conservation</a>.

Madagascar has been described as "one of the most floristically unique places in the world". , 343 families of <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular</a> plants and <a href="bryophytes">bryophytes</a>, with roughly 12,000 species, were known according to the "Catalogue of the plants of Madagascar". Many plant groups are still insufficiently known. Of the vascular plants, 83% are found only on the island. These <a href="endemic">endemic</a>s include five entire plant families: <a href="Asteropeiaceae">Asteropeiaceae</a>, <a href="Barbeuiaceae">Barbeuiaceae</a>, <a href="Physenaceae">Physenaceae</a>, <a href="Sarcolaenaceae">Sarcolaenaceae</a> and <a href="Sphaerosepalaceae">Sphaerosepalaceae</a>. As many as 96% of Madagascan trees and shrubs are estimated to be endemic.

Among the non-flowering plants, <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="lycophyte">lycophyte</a>s and allies count roughly 570 described species in Madagascar. About half of these are endemic; in the scaly tree fern family <a href="Cyatheaceae">Cyatheaceae</a>, native to the humid forests, all but three of 47 species are endemic. Six <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s in genus "<a href="Podocarpus">Podocarpus</a>"—all endemic—and one <a href="cycad">cycad</a> ("<a href="Cycas%20thouarsii">Cycas thouarsii</a>"), are native to the island.

In the <a href="angiosperm">flowering plants</a>, <a href="Basal%20angiosperms">basal groups</a> and <a href="magnoliids">magnoliids</a> account for some 320 Madagascan species, around 94% of which are endemic. The families most rich in species are <a href="Annonaceae">Annonaceae</a>, <a href="Lauraceae">Lauraceae</a>, <a href="Monimiaceae">Monimiaceae</a>, and <a href="Myristicaceae">Myristicaceae</a>, containing mainly trees, shrubs, and <a href="liana">liana</a>s, and the predominantly herbaceous pepper family (<a href="Piperaceae">Piperaceae</a>).

<a href="Monocot">Monocot</a>s are highly diversified. They include Madagascar's most species-rich plant family, the orchids (<a href="Orchidaceae">Orchidaceae</a>), with over 900 species of which 85% are endemic. Palms (<a href="Arecaceae">Arecaceae</a>) have around 200 species in Madagascar (most in the large genus "<a href="Dypsis">Dypsis</a>"), more than three times as many as in continental Africa; all but five are endemic. Other large monocot families include the <a href="Pandanaceae">Pandanaceae</a> with 88 endemic pandan ("<a href="Pandanus">Pandanus</a>") species, mainly found in humid to wet habitats, and the <a href="Asphodelaceae">Asphodelaceae</a>, with most species and over 130 endemics in the succulent genus "<a href="Aloe">Aloe</a>". Grasses (<a href="Poaceae">Poaceae</a>, around 550 species) and sedges (<a href="Cyperaceae">Cyperaceae</a>, around 300) are species-rich, but have lower levels of endemism (40% and 37%, respectively). The endemic traveller's tree ("<a href="Ravenala%20madagascariensis">Ravenala madagascariensis</a>"), a national emblem and widely planted, is the sole Madagascan species in the family <a href="Strelitziaceae">Strelitziaceae</a>.

The <a href="eudicots">eudicots</a> account for most of Madagascar's plant diversity. Their most species-rich families on the island are:

A checklist from 2012 records 751 <a href="moss">moss</a> species and <a href="infraspecific%20taxa">infraspecific taxa</a>, 390 <a href="liverworts">liverworts</a>, and three <a href="hornworts">hornworts</a>. About 34% of the mosses and 19% of the liverworts are endemic. It is unknown how many of these species may have gone extinct since their discovery, and a number likely remain to be described.

Microscopic organisms such as micro-<a href="algae">algae</a> are in general poorly known. A review of freshwater <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s listed 134 species; most of them have been described from fossil deposits and it is unknown if they have become extinct. It is assumed that Madagascar harbours a rich endemic diatom flora. Diatom deposits from lake sediments have been used to reconstruct <a href="paleoclimatic">paleoclimatic</a> variations on the island.

Many undescribed species of <a href="fungi">fungi</a> are suspected in Madagascar. A number of <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a>s are consumed in the country, especially from the genera "<a href="Auricularia">Auricularia</a>", "<a href="Lepiota">Lepiota</a>", "<a href="Cantharellus">Cantharellus</a>" (the chanterelles), and "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>" (the brittlegills). Most of the <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l species are found in plantations of introduced <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> and <a href="pine">pine</a>, but also in native tapia ("<a href="Uapaca%20bojeri">Uapaca bojeri</a>") woodlands. Five hundred species of <a href="lichen">lichen</a> were listed for Madagascar in 2016, but the true number was estimated to be at least twice as high. The chytrid fungus "<a href="Batrachochytrium%20dendrobatidis">Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</a>", responsible for <a href="chytridiomycosis">chytridiomycosis</a>, an infectious disease threatening amphibian populations worldwide, was long considered absent from Madagascar. In 2010 it was recorded, however, and has been confirmed since in various areas and in numerous frog families, alerting scientists to a new threat to the island's already endangered <a href="List%20of%20amphibians%20of%20Madagascar">frog fauna</a>.

Madagascar features contrasting and unique <a href="vegetation%20type">vegetation type</a>s, determined mainly by topography, climate, and geology. A steep eastern <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a> captures most of the rainfall brought by <a href="trade%20winds">trade winds</a> from the Indian Ocean. Consequently, the eastern belt harbours most of the humid forests, while the west has a drier vegetation. The <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> region in the southwest has a <a href="semi-arid">sub-arid</a> climate. The <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">central highland</a>s, above , feature some high mountains, though the <a href="Tsaratanana%20Massif">Tsaratanana Massif</a> in the north has the highest elevation, namely . Temperatures are highest on the west coast, with annual means of up to , while the high <a href="massif">massif</a>s have a cool climate with a annual mean. The <a href="geology%20of%20Madagascar">geology of Madagascar</a> features mainly <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous</a> and <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic</a> basement rocks, with some <a href="lava">lava</a> and <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> in the central and eastern plateaus, while the western part has belts of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="limestone">limestone</a> (including the <a href="tsingy">tsingy</a> formations), and unconsolidated sand.

The marked east–central–west distinction among Madagascan flora was already described by the English naturalist <a href="Richard%20Baron%20%28botanist%29">Richard Baron</a> in 1889. Twentieth-century authors, including <a href="Joseph%20Marie%20Henry%20Alfred%20Perrier%20de%20la%20B%C3%A2thie">Henri Perrier de la Bâthie</a> and <a href="Jean-Henri%20Humbert">Henri Humbert</a>, built upon this concept and proposed several similar classification systems, based on <a href="floristic">floristic</a> and structural criteria. A classification from 2007, the "Atlas of the vegetation of Madagascar", distinguishes 15 vegetation types (including two degraded types and cultivation) based on satellite imagery and ground surveys; they are defined mainly based on vegetation structure and differ in species composition in different parts of the island. They partly correspond to the seven <a href="List%20of%20terrestrial%20ecoregions%20%28WWF%29">terrestrial ecoregions</a> defined by the <a href="World%20Wildlife%20Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> (WWF) in Madagascar.

<a href="Tropical%20rainforest">Tropical rainforest</a> covers around 8% of the island, but used to encompass more than twice as much. It ranges from sea level to elevation and is mainly found on the eastern plateaus, on basement rocks with <a href="lateritic%20soil">lateritic soil</a>s. In the north, humid forest extends west to the <a href="Sambirano%20River">Sambirano</a> river basin and islands including <a href="Nosy%20Be">Nosy Be</a>. Annual rainfall is —up to in areas such as <a href="Masoala%20Peninsula">Masoala peninsula</a>—and the dry season is short or absent. The predominantly evergreen forest, up to , is composed of tree and understory species from various families such as <a href="Burseraceae">Burseraceae</a>, <a href="Ebenaceae">Ebenaceae</a>, Fabaceae, and Myristicaceae; <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>s and <a href="liana">liana</a>s are frequent. <a href="Cyclone">Cyclone</a>s hit the east coast of Madagascar in some years and can destroy habitats. The WWF classifies the eastern belt of humid forest, below elevation, in the "<a href="Madagascar%20lowland%20forests">lowland forests</a>" ecoregion and the montane forests of the highlands in the "<a href="Madagascar%20subhumid%20forests">sub-humid forests</a>" ecoregion.

Degraded humid forest—"savoka" in <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a>—covers ca. 10% of the island. It spans various states of degradation and is composed of forest remnants and planted or otherwise introduced species. It is primarily the result of <a href="slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a> cultivation in primary forest. Some forest fragments still harbour a considerable amount of biodiversity.

Littoral forest, found in several isolated areas along the eastern coast, covers less than 1% of the land area, on mainly sandy sediments. Climate is humid, with annual rainfall. Littoral forest covers sandy soil forest, marsh forest, and grasslands. Its flora includes various tree families, lianas, and <a href="epiphytic">epiphytic</a> orchids and ferns; in the marsh forests, pandans ("Pandanus") and the traveller's tree ("Ravenala madagascariensis") are common. It is part of the WWF's "lowland forests" ecoregion.

An isolated area of humid forest in the south west, on the eastern slope of the <a href="Analavelona">Analavelona</a> massif, is classified as "Western humid forest" by the "Atlas". It occurs on lavas and sand, at elevation. The forest is maintained through condensating moisture from ascending air. It is unprotected but the local population considers it sacred. The WWF includes it in the "sub-humid forests" ecoregion.

Dry forest, accounting for roughly 5% of the surface, is found in the west, from the northern tip of the island to the <a href="Mangoky%20river">Mangoky river</a> in the south. It ranges from sea level to in elevation. Climate is sub-humid to dry, with annual rainfall and a dry season of around six months. Geology is varied and can include limestone forming the eroded tsingy outcrops. Vegetation is diverse; it ranges from forest to bushland and includes trees of the Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and baobab species. The WWF classifies the northern part of this vegetation as "<a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forest">dry deciduous forest</a>" ecoregion and the southern part, including the northernmost range of Didiereaceae, as "<a href="Madagascar%20succulent%20woodlands">succulent woodlands</a>" ecoregion.

"Western sub-humid forest" occurs inland in the southwest and covers less than 1% of the surface, mainly on sandstone, at elevation. Climate is sub-humid to sub-arid, with annual rainfall. The vegetation, up to with a closed canopy, includes diverse trees with many endemics such as baobabs ("Adansonia"), "<a href="Givotia%20madagascariensis">Givotia madagascariensis</a>", and the palm "<a href="Ravenea%20madagascariensis">Ravenea madagascariensis</a>". Cutting, clearing and invasive species such as <a href="opuntia">opuntia</a>s and <a href="agave">agave</a>s threaten this vegetation type. It is part of the WWF's "sub-humid forests" ecoregion.

The driest part of Madagascar in the southwest features the unique "<a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20forests">spiny forests</a>" ecoregion (WWF). They cover ca. 4% of its area, at an elevation below , on limestone and sandstone bedrocks. Mean annual rainfall is very low and concentrated in one month or less. It is a dense thicket composed of plants adapted to dry conditions, notably through <a href="succulent">succulent</a> stems or leaves transformed into spines. The characteristic plants are the endemic <a href="Didiereoideae">Didiereoideae</a> subfamily, baobabs, and "Euphorbia" species. A more open coastal bushland within the region is classified separately by the "Atlas". Degraded spiny forest accounts for ca. 1% of the surface and is the result of cutting, clearing, and encroachment. Introduced species such as agaves and opuntias are found with remnants of the native flora.

<a href="Grassland">Grassland</a>s dominate a large part of Madagascar, more than 75% according to some authors. Mainly found on the central and western plateaus, they are dominated by <a href="C4%20carbon%20fixation">C</a> grasses such as the common "<a href="Aristida%20rufescens">Aristida rufescens</a>" and "<a href="Loudetia%20simplex">Loudetia simplex</a>" and <a href="wildfire">burn</a> regularly. While many authors interpret them as the result of human degradation through tree-felling, cattle raising and intentional burning, it has been suggested that at least some of the grasslands may be primary vegetation. Grassland is often found in a mixture with trees or shrubs, including exotic pine, eucalypt, and <a href="cypress">cypress</a>.

The "Atlas" distinguishes a "wooded grassland–bushland mosaic" covering 23% of the surface and a "plateau grassland–wooded grassland mosaic" covering 42%. Both occur on various substrates and account for most of the WWF's "sub-humid forests" ecoregion. At higher altitudes on thin soil, they grade into an indigenous, <a href="sclerophyllous">hard-leaved</a> vegetation that includes Asteraceae, <a href="Ericaceae">Ericaceae</a>, Lauraceae, and <a href="Podocarpaceae">Podocarpaceae</a> shrubs, among others, and is singled out by the WWF as "<a href="Madagascar%20ericoid%20thickets">ericoid thickets</a>" ecoregion.

An evergreen open forest or woodland type, tapia forest, is found on the western and central plateaus, at altitudes of . It is dominated by the eponymous tapia tree ("Uapaca bojeri") and covers less than 1% of the surface. The broad regional climate is sub-humid to sub-arid, but tapia forest is mainly found in drier <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a>s. Trees other than tapia include the endemic Asteropeiaceae and Sarcolaenaceae, with a herbaceous understory. Tapia forest is subject to human pressure, but relatively well adapted to fire. It falls in the WWF's "sub-humid forests" ecoregion.

Marshes, <a href="swamp%20forests">swamp forests</a> and lakes are found in all regions, along with rivers and streams. Typical species of wet habitats include several endemic "<a href="Cyperus">Cyperus</a>" sedges, ferns, pandans ("Pandanus"), and the traveller's tree. Two species of water lilies ("<a href="Nymphaea%20lotus">Nymphaea lotus</a>" and "<a href="Nymphaea%20nouchali">N. nouchali</a>") are found in the west and east, respectively. <a href="Lagoon">Lagoon</a>s are mainly found on the east coast, but also occur in the west; they have a specialised <a href="halophyte">halophyte</a> flora. <a href="Peat%20bog">Peat bog</a>s are restricted to highlands above elevation; their distinct vegetation includes, among others, "<a href="Sphagnum">Sphagnum</a>" moss and sundew species ("<a href="Drosera">Drosera</a>"). Many wetlands have been converted into rice paddies and are otherwise threatened by destruction and pollution.

<a href="Mangrove">Mangrove</a>s occur on the western, <a href="Mozambique%20channel">Mozambique channel</a> coast, from the very north to just south of the Mangoky river delta. Eleven mangrove tree species are known from Madagascar, of which the most frequent belong to the families Acanthaceae, <a href="Lecythidaceae">Lecythidaceae</a>, <a href="Lythraceae">Lythraceae</a>, <a href="Combretaceae">Combretaceae</a>, and <a href="Rhizophoraceae">Rhizophoraceae</a>. Mangrove forests are threatened by encroachment and cutting. The WWF lists the mangroves of Madagascar as <a href="Madagascar%20mangroves">separate ecoregion</a>.

Madagascar's high species richness and endemicity are attributed to its long isolation as a <a href="continental%20island">continental island</a> since the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era. Once part of the <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> supercontinent, Madagascar separated from continental Africa and from the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> around 150–160 and 84–91 million years ago, respectively. The Madagascan flora was therefore long seen predominantly as a <a href="relict%20%28biology%29">relict</a> of an old Gondwanan vegetation, separated by <a href="vicariance">vicariance</a> through the continental break-up. <a href="Molecular%20clock">Molecular clock</a> analyses however suggest that most plant and other organismal lineages immigrated via across-ocean <a href="Biological%20dispersal">dispersal</a>, given that they are estimated to have diverged from continental groups well after Gondwana broke up. The only endemic plant lineage on Madagascar sufficiently old to be a possible Gondwana relict appears to be "<a href="Takhtajania%20perrieri">Takhtajania perrieri</a>" (<a href="Winteraceae">Winteraceae</a>). Most <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> plant groups have African affinities, consistent with the relatively small distance to the continent, and there are also strong similarities with the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> islands of the <a href="Comoros">Comoros</a>, <a href="Mascarenes">Mascarenes</a>, and <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>. There are however also links to other, more distant floras, such as those of India and <a href="Malesia">Malesia</a>.

After their separation from Africa, Madagascar and India moved polewards, to a position south of 30° latitude. During the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> and <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, now separated from India, Madagasar moved northwards again and crossed the <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a>. This passage likely induced a dry, desert-like climate across the island, which later contracted to what is today the sub-arid spiny thicket in the southwest. Humid forests probably established since the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, when India had cleared the eastern seaway, allowing trade winds to bring in rainfall, and Madagascar had moved north of the subtropical ridge. The intensification of the Indian Ocean <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> system after around eight million years ago is believed to have further favoured the expansion of humid and sub-humid forests in the <a href="Late%20Miocene">Late Miocene</a>, especially in the northern Sambirano region. Some of the grasslands may also date to the Late Miocene, when there was a global grassland expansion.

Several hypotheses exist as to how plants and other organisms have <a href="speciation">diversified</a> into so many species in Madagascar. They mainly assume either that species diverged in <a href="parapatric%20speciation">parapatry</a> by gradually adapting to different environmental conditions on the island, for example dry versus humid, or lowland versus montane habitats, or that barriers such as large rivers, mountain ranges, or open land between forest fragments, favoured <a href="allopatric%20speciation">allopatric speciation</a>. A Madagascan lineage of "Euphorbia" occurs across the island, but some species evolved succulent leaves, stems and tubers in adaptation to arid conditions. In contrast, endemic tree ferns ("Cyathea") all evolved under very similar conditions in Madagascan humid forests, through three recent radiations in the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>.

<a href="Fauna%20of%20Madagascar">Madagascar's fauna</a> is thought to have <a href="coevolution">coevolved</a> to a certain extent with its flora: The famous plant–pollinator <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualism</a> predicted by <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, between the orchid "<a href="Angraecum%20sesquipedale">Angraecum sesquipedale</a>" and the moth "<a href="Xanthopan%20morganii">Xanthopan morganii</a>", is found on the island. Highly unstable rainfall in Madagascar was suggested to have created unpredictable patterns of flowering and fruiting in plants; this in turn would have narrowed opportunities for flower- and fruit-feeding animals and could explain their relatively low numbers in Madagascar. Among these, <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s are the most important, but the historic extinctions of <a href="giant%20lemur">giant lemur</a>s probably deprived some large-seeded plants of their seed dispersers. The extinct Madagascan <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> also included <a href="grazing">grazer</a>s such as two giant tortoises ("<a href="Aldabrachelys">Aldabrachelys</a>") and the <a href="Malagasy%20hippopotamus">Malagasy hippopotamus</a>es, but it is unclear to what extent their habitats resembled today's widespread grasslands.

Madagascar and its natural history remained relatively unknown outside the island before the 17th century. Its only overseas connections were occasional Arab, Portuguese, Dutch, and English sailors, who brought home anecdotes and tales about the fabulous nature of Madagascar. With the <a href="French%20colonial%20Empire">growing influence of the French</a> in the Indian Ocean, it was mainly French naturalists that documented Madagascar's flora in the following centuries.

<a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20Flacourt">Étienne de Flacourt</a>, envoy of France at the military post of Fort Dauphin (<a href="Tolagnaro">Tolagnaro</a>) in the south of Madagascar from 1648 to 1655, wrote the first detailed account of the island, "Histoire de la grande isle Madagascar" (1658), with a chapter dedicated to the flora. He was the first to mention the endemic pitcher plant "<a href="Nepenthes%20madagascariensis">Nepenthes madagascariensis</a>" and the Madagascar periwinkle. About one century later, in 1770, French naturalists and voyagers <a href="Philibert%20Commerson">Philibert Commerson</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Sonnerat">Pierre Sonnerat</a> visited the island from the "Isle de France" (now <a href="Mauritius%20Island">Mauritius</a>). They collected and described a number of plant species, and many of Commerson's specimens were described later by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20de%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck</a> and <a href="Jean%20Louis%20Marie%20Poiret">Jean Louis Marie Poiret</a> in France. Sonnerat described, among others, the emblematic traveller's tree. Another contemporary, <a href="Louis-Marie%20Aubert%20du%20Petit-Thouars">Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars</a>, also visited Madagascar from the "Isle de France"; he collected on the island for six months and wrote, among others, "Histoire des végétaux recueillis dans les îles australes d'Afrique" and a work on orchids of Madagascar and the Mascarenes.

French naturalist <a href="Alfred%20Grandidier">Alfred Grandidier</a> was a preeminent 19th-century authority on Malagasy wildlife. His first visit in 1865 was followed by several other expeditions. He produced an atlas of the island and, in 1885, published "L'Histoire physique, naturelle et politique de Madagascar", which would comprise 39 volumes. Although his main contributions were in zoology, he was also a prolific plant collector; several plants were named after him, including Grandidier's baobab ("<a href="Adansonia%20grandidieri">Adansonia grandidieri</a>") and the endemic succulent genus "<a href="Didierea">Didierea</a>". The British missionary and naturalist Richard Baron, Grandidier's contemporary, lived in Madagascar from 1872 to 1907 where he also collected plants and discovered up to 1,000 new species; many of his specimens were described by <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Kew</a> botanist <a href="John%20Gilbert%20Baker">John Gilbert Baker</a>. Baron was the first to catalogue Madagascar's vascular flora in his "Compendium des plantes malgaches", including over 4,700 species and varieties known at that time.

During the <a href="French%20Madagascar">French colonial period</a> (1897 to 1958), Henri Perrier de la Bâthie was a major botanist in Madagascar. Beginning study in 1896, he compiled a large herbarium which he later donated to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20%28France%29">National Museum of Natural History</a> in Paris. Among his publications were notably the first classification of the island's vegetation, "La végétation malgache" (1921), and "Biogéographie des plantes de Madagascar" (1936), and he directed the publication of the "Catalogue des plantes de Madagascar" in 29 volumes. His contemporary and collaborator Henri Humbert, a professor in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> and later in Paris, made ten expeditions to Madagascar and, in 1936, initiated and edited the monograph series "Flore de Madagascar et des Comores". A number of other important botanists, working in the colonial era through to Madagascar's independence, described more than 200 species each: <a href="Aim%C3%A9e%20Antoinette%20Camus">Aimée Camus</a> lived in France and specialised in grasses; <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Paul%20Raymond%20Capuron">René Capuron</a> was a major contributor to the woody plant flora; and <a href="Jean%20Bosser">Jean Bosser</a>, director of the French <a href="ORSTOM">ORSTOM</a> institute in <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>, worked with grasses, sedges, and orchids. <a href="Roger%20Heim">Roger Heim</a> was one of the major <a href="mycologist">mycologist</a>s working in Madagascar.

Today, national and international research institutions are documenting the flora of Madagascar. The <a href="Botanical%20and%20Zoological%20Garden%20of%20Tsimbazaza">Botanical and Zoological Garden of Tsimbazaza</a> hosts a botanical garden and the country's largest herbarium with over 80,000 specimens. The FO.FI.FA (Center for Research on Rural Development) herbarium has some 60,000 specimens of primarily woody plants; a number of them and those of the Tsimbazaza herbarium have been digitised and are available online through <a href="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> and <a href="Tropicos">Tropicos</a>. The <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20d%27Antananarivo">University of Antananarivo</a> has a department for plant biology and ecology.

Outside the country, England's Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew is one of the leading institutions in the revision of Madagascar's plant families; it also maintains a permanent conservation centre in Madagascar and cooperates with the "Silo National des Graines Forestières" to build a <a href="seed%20bank">seed bank</a> of Madagascan plants in the <a href="Millennium%20Seed%20Bank">Millennium Seed Bank</a> project. The National Museum of Natural History in Paris has traditionally been one of the centres of research on the flora of Madagascar. It holds a herbarium with roughly 700,000 Malagasy plant specimens and a seed bank and living collection, and continues to edit the "Flore de Madagascar et des Comores" series begun by Humbert in 1936. The <a href="Missouri%20Botanical%20Garden">Missouri Botanical Garden</a> maintains the "Catalogue of the plants of Madagascar", a major online resource, and also has a permanent base in Madagascar.

Madagascar was colonised rather recently compared to other landmasses, with first evidence for humans—arrived from either Africa or Asia—dating to 2,300 or perhaps 4,000 <a href="years%20before%20present">years before present</a>. It is assumed that humans first stayed near the coast and penetrated into the interior only several centuries later. The settlers had a profound impact on the long-isolated environment of Madagascar through land clearing and fire, introduction of <a href="zebu">zebu</a> cattle, and probably hunting to extinction the native megafauna including, among others, <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a>s, giant lemurs and giant tortoises. The first Europeans arrived in the 16th century, starting an age of overseas exchange. Population growth and transformation of the landscape was particularly rapid since the mid-20th century.

The native flora of Madagascar is used for a variety of purposes by the <a href="Malagasy%20people">Malagasy people</a>. Richard Baron, at the end of the 19th century, described more than one hundred native plants used locally and commercially. These include many timber trees such as native ebony ("<a href="Diospyros">Diospyros</a>") and rosewood ("<a href="Dalbergia">Dalbergia</a>") species, the raffia palm "<a href="Raphia%20farinifera">Raphia farinifera</a>" used for fibre, <a href="Natural%20dye">dyeing</a> plants, as well as medicinal and edible plants.

The traveller's tree has various uses in the east of Madagascar, chiefly as building material. Madagascar's national instrument "<a href="valiha">valiha</a>" is made from bamboo and lent its name to the endemic genus "<a href="Valiha%20%28genus%29">Valiha</a>". <a href="Yam%20%28vegetable%29">Yam</a>s ("Dioscorea") in Madagascar include introduced, widely cultivated species as well as some 30 endemics, all edible. Edible mushrooms, including endemic species, are collected and sold locally (see above, "Diversity and endemism: Non-vascular plants and fungi").

Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. An <a href="ethnobotanical">ethnobotanical</a> study in the southwestern littoral forest, for instance, found 152 native plants used locally as medicine, and countrywide, over 230 plant species have been used as traditional <a href="Antimalarial%20medication">malaria treatments</a>. The diverse flora of Madagascar holds potential for <a href="natural%20product">natural product</a> research and drug production on an industrial scale; the Madagascar periwinkle ("Cataranthus roseus"), a source of alkaloids used in the treatment of different cancers, is a famous example.

One of the characteristic features of agriculture in Madagascar is the widespread cultivation of <a href="rice">rice</a>. The cereal is a staple of <a href="Malagasy%20cuisine">Malagasy cuisine</a> and has been an important export crop since pre-colonial times. It was likely introduced with early <a href="Austronesian">Austronesian</a> settlers, and <a href="Archaeobotany">archaeobotanical</a> remains evidence its presence in Madagascar at least by the 11th century. Both the "indica" and "japonica" varieties were introduced early on. Rice was first cultivated in mud flats and marshes near the coast, reaching the highlands much later. Its widespread cultivation in <a href="terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terraced fields</a> was promoted with the expansion of the <a href="Imerina">Imerina</a> kingdom in the 19th century. Land conversion for rice cultivation has been an important cause of wetlands loss.

Other major crops, such as <a href="greater%20yam">greater yam</a>, <a href="coconut">coconut</a>, <a href="taro">taro</a> and <a href="turmeric">turmeric</a> are also believed to have been brought in by early settlers from Asia. Other crops have a likely African origin, such as <a href="cowpea">cowpea</a>, <a href="bambara%20groundnut">bambara groundnut</a>, <a href="oil%20palm">oil palm</a>, and <a href="tamarind">tamarind</a>. Some crops like <a href="teff">teff</a>, <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="common%20millet">common millet</a> and <a href="Cooking%20banana">plantain</a> may have been present before colonisation, but it is possible that humans brought new <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s. Arab traders presumably brought fruits such as <a href="mango">mango</a>, <a href="pomegranate">pomegranate</a>, and <a href="grapes">grapes</a>. Later European traders and colonists introduced crops like <a href="litchi">litchi</a> and <a href="avocado">avocado</a> and promoted the cultivation of exports like <a href="cloves">cloves</a>, coconut, <a href="coffee">coffee</a> and <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a> in <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s. Today Madagascar is the primary vanilla-producing country worldwide.

<a href="Forestry">Forestry</a> in Madagascar involves many exotic species such as eucalypts, pines and <a href="acacia">acacia</a>s. The traditional slash-and-burn agriculture ("tavy"), practised for centuries, today accelerates the loss of primary forests as populations grow (see below, "Threats and conservation").

More than 1,300 <a href="introduced%20species">exotic plants</a> have been reported in Madagascar, with the legumes (Fabaceae) the most frequent family. This represents around 10% relative to the native flora, a ratio lower than in many islands and closer to what is known for continental floras. Many exotic plant species have been introduced for agriculture or other uses. Around 600 species have <a href="Naturalisation%20%28biology%29">naturalised</a> and some are considered <a href="invasive%20species">invasive</a>. A notorious example is the South American water hyacinth ("<a href="Eichhornia%20crassipes">Eichhornia crassipes</a>"), which spread widely through subtropical and tropical regions and is considered a serious plant pest in wetlands. In general, invasive plants spread mostly in already disturbed, secondary vegetation, and the remaining primary forests of the east appear little affected.

A prickly pear cactus, "<a href="Opuntia%20monacantha">Opuntia monacantha</a>", was introduced to southwest Madagascar in the late 18th century by French colonialists, who used it as natural fence to protect military forts and gardens. The cactus quickly spread and found use as cattle feed by <a href="Antandroy">Antandroy</a> pastoralists. In the early 20th century, <a href="Dactylopius">cochineals</a> were introduced as a <a href="biological%20control">biological control</a> for the plant, which had become a nuisance; they rapidly eradicated most of the cacti. This probably led to famine among the Antandroy people, although some authors challenge the causal link between famine and cactus eradication. Today, several "Opuntia" species are again present mainly in the south, spreading into native vegetation in some areas.

The prickly pear illustrates the dilemma of plant introductions: while many authors see exotic plants as a threat to the native flora, others argue that they have not yet been linked directly to the extinction of a native species, and that some may actually provide economic or ecological benefits. A number of plants native to Madagascar have become invasive in other regions, such as the traveller's tree in <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> and the flamboyant tree ("<a href="Delonix%20regia">Delonix regia</a>") in various tropical countries.

Madagascar, together with its neighbouring islands, is considered a <a href="biodiversity%20hotspot">biodiversity hotspot</a> because of its high species richness and endemism coupled with a dramatic decrease of primary vegetation. Six of the seven WWF ecoregions in Madagascar (see "<a href="%23Vegetation%20types">Vegetation types</a>") are considered "critical/endangered". Data on the distribution and status of many native plants in Madagascar are still lacking, but a 2011 <a href="Red%20List">Red List</a> assessed 1,676 endemic vascular plant species and found over 1,000 of them to be endangered or critically endangered.

Rapid human population increase and economic activity entail <a href="habitat%20loss">habitat loss</a> and <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">fragmentation</a>, in particular <a href="Deforestation%20in%20Madagascar">massive deforestation</a>. Forest cover decreased by around 40% from the 1950s to 2000, and the remaining forests are highly fragmented. Slash-and-burn cultivation has a long tradition but with an ever-denser population, forest is cut faster than it regrows, especially in the humid east. In addition, <a href="Illegal%20logging%20in%20Madagascar">illegal logging</a> of luxury timber species such as rosewood and ebony increased especially with the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">2009 Malagasy political crisis</a>. Rare plants, such as endemic succulents and baobabs, are threatened by harvest and trade for horticulture, food, or cosmetics. <a href="Global%20warming">Global warming</a> is expected to reduce or shift climatically suitable areas for plant species and threatens coastal habitats, such as littoral forests, through rising sea levels.

Conservation of natural habitats in Madagascar is concentrated in over —around 10% of the total land surface—of <a href="National%20parks%20of%20Madagascar">national parks</a> and other nature reserves, an area that has tripled from 2003 to 2013. These protected areas include the <a href="World%20Heritage">World Heritage</a> sites <a href="Tsingy%20de%20Bemaraha%20Strict%20Nature%20Reserve">Tsingy de Bemaraha</a> and the <a href="Rainforests%20of%20the%20Atsinanana">Rainforests of the Atsinanana</a>. Some critically endangered plant species have been grown "<a href="Ex%20situ%20conservation">ex situ</a>" in nursery programmes, and seeds have been collected and stored in the Millennium Seed Bank project. Madagascar is the country with the highest proportion of its flora listed in the <a href="CITES">CITES</a> convention, which aims to control trade in endangered species. To reduce unsustainable deforestation by local communities, better <a href="land-use%20planning">land-use planning</a>, crop <a href="intensive%20farming">intensification</a> and <a href="Agricultural%20diversification">diversification</a>, promotion of <a href="non-timber%20forest%20product">non-timber forest product</a>s, economic empowerment through <a href="land%20tenure">land tenure</a> security and access to credit, and <a href="family%20planning">family planning</a> have been proposed. The <a href="ecological%20restoration">restoration</a> of <a href="wildlife%20corridor">wildlife corridor</a>s between fragmented habitats to support species migration has been proposed for <a href="climate%20change%20adaptation">climate change adaptation</a>. To reduce species loss along coastal areas targeted for <a href="titanium">titanium</a> extraction, agreements with the <a href="QIT%20Madagascar%20Minerals">QMM</a> mining company include the setting aside of conservation areas and habitat restoration.

Finn M. W. Caspersen

Finn Michael Westby Caspersen Sr. (October 27, 1941 – September 7, 2009) was an American financier and philanthropist. A graduate of the <a href="Peddie%20School">Peddie School</a>, <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> and <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a>, he followed his father, Olaus Caspersen, a <a href="Norwegian%20Americans">Norwegian immigrant</a> to the United States, as chairman and chief executive of <a href="Beneficial%20Corporation">Beneficial Corporation</a>, one of the largest <a href="consumer%20finance">consumer finance</a> companies in the United States. After an $8.6 billion acquisition of Beneficial by <a href="Household%20International">Household International</a> in 1998, Caspersen ran Knickerbocker Management, a private financial firm overseeing the assets of trusts and foundations.

As a philanthropist, Caspersen donated tens of millions of dollars to the <a href="Peddie%20School">Peddie School</a>, Brown, Harvard, and <a href="Drew%20University">Drew University</a>, while overseeing the Hodson Trust, which benefitted four institutions in Maryland. He described education as his "particular love" and regarded it as "an investment in the future—an investment in human capital." Buildings and endowed professorships have been named in his honor. Caspersen's philanthropy extended to rowing and equestrian sports, and service to the <a href="United%20States%20Equestrian%20Team%20Foundation">United States Equestrian Team Foundation</a>, Princeton National Rowing Association, and the National Rowing Foundation.

Caspersen was an influential donor to <a href="Republican%20party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidates at the state and national level. In the 1980s, he was a major supporter of former New Jersey governor <a href="Thomas%20Kean">Thomas Kean</a>. He served as a town commissioner in <a href="Jupiter%20Island%2C%20Florida">Jupiter Island, Florida</a>, an exclusive upper-class enclave, for four years, resigning a few weeks before his suicide in September 2009.

News reports linked Caspersen with financial problems and accusations of alleged large-scale tax evasion that were discovered in the course of federal investigations into offshore tax shelters managed by financial firms <a href="UBS">UBS</a> and <a href="LGT%20Bank">LGT Bank</a>, and used by wealthy American clients. Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts. An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts or anything else.

Finn Michael Westby Caspersen was born on October 27, 1941 in New York City. He was one of two sons of Olaus Westby Caspersen (1896–1971), a Norwegian immigrant, and Freda Resika (1909–1991), an American-born <a href="Eastern%20European%20Jews">Eastern European Jew</a> thought to be of Russian or Polish descent. Olaus's widowed mother and siblings had emigrated to the United States earlier, leaving Olaus in Norway to complete his education. Olaus came to the United States in 1912 at age 16, settling in <a href="Weehawken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Weehawken, New Jersey</a>.

Finn Caspersen's mother, Freda, was a non-practicing Jew, and his father thought that his sons needed a religious upbringing. Finn attended a <a href="congregational%20church">congregational church</a> near the family home in his youth. He later reflected that "being Protestant was important. There was a kind of anti-Catholicism in the family." The family moved to homes in <a href="Andover%2C%20New%20Jersey">Andover, New Jersey</a>, and <a href="Venice%2C%20Florida">Venice, Florida</a>. Caspersen frequently visited Norway as a child, vacationing there during summers after 1947.

Caspersen attended private schools until the ninth grade. He attended the <a href="Peddie%20School">Peddie School</a>, a private <a href="University-preparatory%20school">preparatory school</a> in <a href="Hightstown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hightstown, New Jersey</a>, and was graduated in 1959. Caspersen received a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> (B.A.) degree from <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> in 1963 and a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">law degree</a> (LL.B.) from <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> in 1966.

In 1972, Caspersen joined the legal department at Beneficial Corporation, a large American consumer finance firm. Four years later, he was named the firm's chief executive officer. Beneficial had been established in 1914 in <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a>, by Clarence Hodson. Caspersen's father, Olaus, joined Beneficial in 1920 and served as Hodson's secretary for several years. In 1929, Hodson and Caspersen reorganized the firm as Beneficial Finance Corporation and transformed it into one of the largest consumer loan providers in the United States. Freda Caspersen was one of the company's directors.

Under the younger Caspersen's leadership, Beneficial expanded into credit finance and offered credit cards through its People's Bank and Trust subsidiary. It purchased Parliament Leasing in 1977, and First Texas Financial Corp., a savings and loan firm, in 1978. In 1977, Beneficial entered the reinsurance business through subsidiaries, but these endeavors led to significant financial losses in the 1980s. Beneficial later downsized its reinsurance holdings and restructured to emphasize its <a href="second%20mortgage">second mortgage</a> business. According to Charles "Sandy" Hance, former senior vice president and general counsel of Beneficial, Caspersen was a "pioneer in second mortgages, which later evolved into <a href="home%20equity%20loan">home equity loan</a>s", and that he "saw this trend developing at a very early stage".

Caspersen purchased <a href="Harbour%20Island%20%28Tampa%29">Harbour Island</a> in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, from a Beneficial subsidiary in 1979, and in 1983 began to re-develop the island into an upscale residential and commercial development similar to the <a href="Inner%20Harbor">Inner Harbor</a> in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>. Beneficial purchased the 177-acre man-made island, formerly known as Seddon Island. Before it was developed, local newspapers described the Harbour Island as "an industrial wasteland inhabited by wild pigs" and the only structures as rusted railroad tracks and an unused phosphate facility. When the first phases were complete, the island opened with events hosted by former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. president</a> <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>. After seven years of dwindling business, Beneficial converted the development into office space, and renamed it Knights Point in 1995.

Caspersen ran Beneficial for 22 years before its 1998 acquisition by <a href="Household%20International">Household International</a> for $8.6 billion. At the time of the acquisition, Beneficial had 25,000 employees and operated 1,650 branch offices throughout the United States. Caspersen was paid $24 million in severance and other payments. His next business endeavor was Knickerbocker Management, which he founded in 1998 with a few partners. Knickerbocker, a private investment firm that oversaw approximately $1 billion in assets of trusts and foundations, had offices in Gladstone, New Jersey and Hobe Sound, Florida.

Caspersen became an influential donor to state and federal Republican party candidates, including former New Jersey governors <a href="Thomas%20Kean">Thomas Kean</a> and <a href="Christine%20Todd%20Whitman">Christine Todd Whitman</a>, and Kean's son <a href="Thomas%20Kean%20Jr.">Thomas Kean Jr.</a>, a <a href="New%20Jersey%20Senate">state senator</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20New%20Jersey%2C%202006">candidate for United States Senator</a>. Caspersen was a major supporter of Kean's two campaigns for governor in 1981 and 1985. When Kean was inaugurated in 1982, Caspersen, an avid equestrian, dressed in period costume and drove the incoming governor and his wife, as well as outgoing governor <a href="Brendan%20Byrne">Brendan Byrne</a>, to an inauguration party in a four-horse carriage. One writer described the scene as "something out of '<a href="Currier%20and%20Ives">a Currier & Ives print</a>. In 1998, Whitman appointed Caspersen to chair a 15-member advisory panel to recommend future development for <a href="Ellis%20Island">Ellis Island</a>, and to a public-private partnership to foster business in the state. According to "Vanity Fair" contributor William D. Cohan, left-wing magazine "<a href="Mother%20Jones%20%28magazine%29">Mother Jones</a>" found that "Caspersen and his wife donated $602,250 to political campaigns, making them the eighth-largest political donors in the U.S." during the 2000 election cycle.

In 2005, Caspersen sought a seat on the town commission in <a href="Jupiter%20Island%2C%20Florida">Jupiter Island, Florida</a>; his platform focused on conservation, limiting development, and burying utility cables. He served a four-year term, and ran unopposed for re-election in 2009. He surprised his fellow commission members and neighbors by suddenly resigning on August 4, 2009, claiming that he anticipated moving from the community.

In 1967, Caspersen married Barbara Warden Morris, the daughter of <a href="Samuel%20Morris%20%28Pennsylvania%20politician%29">Samuel Wheeler Morris Jr.</a> (1918–1995) and Eleanor May Jones (1919–2011), one of Philadelphia's socially prominent <a href="Philadelphia%20Main%20Line">Main Line</a> families. They were married for 42 years. Caspersen met his wife when she was an undergraduate student at <a href="Wellesley%20College">Wellesley College</a>. She later obtained a masters and doctoral degree from <a href="Drew%20University">Drew University</a>, submitting a masters thesis on <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>'s "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>", and a doctoral dissertation on the works of <a href="Willa%20Cather">Willa Cather</a>. For several years, Barbara Caspersen has served on the university's board of trustees and currently serves in an emeritus capacity. The Caspersens had two homes in New Jersey—in Andover and <a href="Bernardsville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bernardsville</a> in areas described as "in New Jersey horse country", a 6,500-square-foot waterfront estate Westerly, Rhode Island, and a residence in Jupiter Island, Florida. The couple had four sons, Finn M. W. Caspersen Jr., Erik M. W. Caspersen, Samuel M. W. Caspersen, and <a href="Andrew%20Caspersen">Andrew W. W. Caspersen</a>. All four of his sons were graduated from Harvard Law School. <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Beat%20Reporting">Pulitzer Prize-winning</a> journalist and Harvard alumnus <a href="Daniel%20Golden">Daniel Golden</a>, in a book criticizing the role of privilege and wealth at elite colleges, attributed their admission to the prestigious law school to their father's generosity. Caspersen served as an officer in the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a>. He was a member of the <a href="Knickerbocker%20Club">Knickerbocker Club</a>, an exclusive, upper-class, men-only social club on New York City's <a href="Upper%20East%20Side">Upper East Side</a>.

Caspersen was a talented equestrian in <a href="Combined%20driving">carriage driving</a>, winning three national championships and representing the United States at three <a href="World%20Equestrian%20Games">world championships</a>. In 1985, he won the <a href="Four-in-hand%20%28carriage%29">four-in-hand</a> carriage driving competition at the <a href="Royal%20Windsor%20Horse%20Show">Royal Windsor Horse Show</a> in the United Kingdom and later was an honorary lifetime officer of the show. According to "Sports Illustrated", Caspersen, described as "portly and patrician, tall and splendidly erect, with a lot of beef in his jowls" recalled being asked by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> at the awards ceremony about his role in driving his team of <a href="Holsteiner%20horse">Holsteiners</a>: "I told her it was to lower the carriage's center of gravity, ... She looked at my midriff and said I was well suited for the job."

He was the father of <a href="Andrew%20Caspersen">Andrew Caspersen</a> and three other sons.

Finn Caspersen died on September 7, 2009 in the Shelter Harbor community of Westerly, Rhode Island, from an apparent <a href="Ballistic%20trauma">gunshot wound</a> to the head. The <a href="cause%20of%20death">cause of death</a> was ruled a suicide. A <a href="Bluing%20%28steel%29">blued-steel</a> <a href=".38">.38-calibre</a>, five-shot <a href="Smith%20%26amp%3B%20Wesson">Smith & Wesson</a> revolver belonging to Caspersen was found near his body. According to law enforcement sources investigating the suicide, Caspersen left a note stating that he "was tired, diminished and in constant pain, and that he did not want to be a burden to his loving family".

Caspersen had been battling <a href="kidney%20cancer">kidney cancer</a> before his death, and reportedly pursued regular <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> treatment. Several sources described his health as deteriorating and the cancer severe. Others indicated that his medical condition led to depression, describing an uncertainty that left him "sort of horrified about his medical outcome". Bernard Davidoff, an <a href="Internal%20medicine">internist</a> from New Jersey apparently familiar with Caspersen's medical care, advised police that Caspersen "suffered from severe depression and was taking antidepressant meds, heart meds, liver meds, kidney meds and diabetes meds". It was also reported that medical issues and chemotherapy treatments "had severely hobbled him in recent years".

A <a href="memorial%20service">memorial service</a> held on September 15, 2009 at St. Peter's Episcopal Church in <a href="Morristown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morristown, New Jersey</a>, was attended by 900 friends and relatives. Caspersen was <a href="Eulogy">eulogized</a> by former New Jersey governor and Drew University president Thomas Kean.

In the weeks after his death, reports emerged that Caspersen had listed his Westerly, Rhode Island, home for sale for $10.9 million, was facing financial and legal difficulties. Caspersen had begun to step back from various philanthropic efforts and institutional boards at Harvard, Peddie, and the Hodson Trust. Eight days after his death in 2009, a "New York Times" article cited an anonymous source, to report that Caspersen was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and was suspected of owing as much as $100 million in back taxes and fines, and facing possible imprisonment. "The New York Times" article reported that Caspersen was caught up in a broader federal investigation into <a href="Offshore%20financial%20centre">tax havens</a> and <a href="Offshore%20bank">offshore bank accounts</a> used by wealthy Americans to avoid paying taxes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It was reported that his name was turned over to federal investigators by Swiss banking giant <a href="UBS">UBS</a> earlier in the year, and in connection to <a href="LGT%20Bank">Liechtenstein Global Trust</a> (LGT), a private bank controlled by <a href="Prince%20of%20Liechtenstein%20Foundation">Liechtenstein’s royal family</a>.

In 2015 an attorney for Caspersen’s estate stated Caspersen’s tax returns for 2005-2008 had been audited, in an investigation that did not conclude until 2013. The attorney, Denis Conlon, stated that the net result of the four-year audit was a $7,000 refund from the government for overpayment in one year, $14,000 of additional tax due for another year (in which Caspersen had over $2.7 million of income), no refunds or additional taxes dues for the other two years, and no fines or penalties imposed for alleged offshore accounts or other conduct.

Caspersen served as a board member, president, and chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Equestrian%20Team">United States Equestrian Team</a> from 1982 to 2002. He was considered "the man who put American combined driving on the international map". During his 20-year tenure, American riders and drivers earned 71 medals, including 25 gold, in the <a href="Equestrian%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympics</a>, <a href="FEI%20World%20Equestrian%20Games">World Championships</a>, and <a href="Pan%20American%20Games">Pan American Games</a>. Caspersen helped the U.S. Equestrian Team establish a permanent home at Hamilton Farm, the former estate of U.S. Treasury Secretary <a href="Nicholas%20F.%20Brady">Nicholas F. Brady</a> in <a href="Bedminster%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bedminster, New Jersey</a>. The Hamilton Farm property was owned by Beneficial and was located next to the corporation's headquarters. Beneficial deeded the property to the team at Caspersen's urging.

Caspersen supported rowing, and was involved with the Princeton National Rowing Association (PNRA) and Princeton International Regatta Association (PIRA). In 1998, he provided funding to build a boathouse to benefit the rowing programs of Peddie and the nearby <a href="Lawrenceville%20School">Lawrenceville School</a> on the north shore of <a href="Mercer%20Lake">Mercer Lake</a> in <a href="West%20Windsor%2C%20New%20Jersey">West Windsor, New Jersey</a>. Located at the Mercer Lake Race Course—site of the 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008 United States Olympic Rowing Team Trials—the facility is used for training, racing, camps, clinics and administration by Peddie, Lawrenceville, the <a href="Hun%20School">Hun School</a>, high schools in <a href="Mercer%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mercer County, New Jersey</a>, <a href="USRowing">USRowing</a>, the US National Team, and the Mercer Junior Rowing Club, as well as PNRA and PIRA.

Throughout his life, Caspersen was closely involved with the management of several universities and schools, serving on the directing boards of the Peddie School, Brown, and the Dean's Advisory Board at Harvard Law School. In a 2008 interview, he stated that he believed education was "investment in the future—an investment in human capital. I've been active in a range of other things, but education's always been my particular love".

Caspersen <a href="Endowed%20professor%23Endowed%20professorships">endowed two professorships</a> at Harvard Law School—the Beneficial Professorship of Law, and the Finn M.W. Caspersen and Household International Professorship of Law. In 2003, he was chairman of Harvard Law School's <a href="Fundraising">capital campaign</a>, which he helped jump-start by pledging $30 million—the largest single donation in the school's history. The campaign ultimately raised $476,475,707. The law school honored Caspersen by naming a <a href="special%20collections">special collections</a> room in its <a href="Langdell%20Hall">Library</a> after him. In April 2012, Harvard dedicated part of a 250,000-square-foot multipurpose construction project, which housed student organizations, journals, and social activities, to Caspersen, calling it the "Caspersen Student Center". Critics attacked Harvard's decision to name the facilities after Caspersen after his alleged tax evasion was made public.

Barbara Caspersen has served as trustee (currently as an emeritus trustee) of <a href="Drew%20University">Drew University</a> and as both chairwoman and vice-chairwoman of the liberal arts college's board. In 1999, the Caspersens provided a $5 million gift for expanding graduate education programs at Drew. In honor of their service to the university, Drew renamed its graduate school as the "Caspersen School of Graduate Studies". The university's Rose Memorial Library houses a collection of books, manuscripts, artifacts and papers of Nebraska-born author <a href="Willa%20Cather">Willa Cather</a> (1873–1947) assembled from items given by several donors—including significant contributions by Caspersen and his wife. It is regarded as one of the best collection of Cather's papers assembled in the United States.

Caspersen donated funds to build a four-level annex, named in honor of his parents, to Brown University's historic <a href="John%20Carter%20Brown%20Library">John Carter Brown Library</a>, dedicated in 1991. Caspersen also served as a trustee of the Peddie School starting in 1970, and as the board's chairman starting in 1976. In 1998, he and philanthropist <a href="Walter%20H.%20Annenberg">Walter H. Annenberg</a> each donated $10 million to the school. The "Caspersen Campus Center", which opened in 1996, and "Caspersen History House", dedicated in 2006, were named in his honor.

From 1976 until a few weeks before his death, Caspersen ran the Hodson Trust, established by Beneficial founder Clarence Hodson to award grants to four colleges in Maryland: <a href="Hood%20College">Hood College</a>, <a href="The%20Johns%20Hopkins%20University">The Johns Hopkins University</a>, <a href="St.%20John%27s%20College%20%28Annapolis/Santa%20Fe%29">St. John’s College</a>, and <a href="Washington%20College">Washington College</a>. Under the first 25 years of Caspersen's stewardship, the trust donated over $118 million to the four institutions. Caspersen was awarded <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a>s for his service to education; Washington College conferred an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 1981 and Hood College awarded Caspersen with an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> degree in 1983.

Florence Fuller

Florence Ada Fuller (1867 – 17 July 1946) was a South African-born Australian artist. Originally from <a href="Port%20Elizabeth">Port Elizabeth</a>, Fuller migrated as a child to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> with her family. There she trained with her uncle <a href="Robert%20Hawker%20Dowling">Robert Hawker Dowling</a> and teacher <a href="Jane%20Sutherland">Jane Sutherland</a> and took classes at the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria%20Art%20School">National Gallery of Victoria Art School</a>, becoming a professional artist in the late 1880s. In 1892 she left Australia, travelling first to South Africa, where she met and painted for <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>, and then on to Europe. She lived and studied there for the subsequent decade, except for a return to South Africa in 1899 to paint a portrait of Rhodes. Between 1895 and 1904 her works were exhibited at the <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Paris Salon</a> and London's <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>.

In 1904, Fuller returned to Australia, living in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>. She became active in the <a href="Theosophical%20Society">Theosophical Society</a> and painted some of her best-known work, including "A Golden Hour", described by the National Gallery of Australia as a "masterpiece" when it acquired the work in 2013. Beginning in 1908, Fuller travelled extensively, living in India and England before ultimately settling in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. There, she was the inaugural teacher of <a href="figure%20drawing">life drawing</a> at the School of Fine and Applied Arts, established in 1920 by the New South Wales Society of Women Painters. She died in 1946.

Highly regarded during her active career as a portrait and landscape painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries—three in Australia and one in South Africa—a record for a woman who was an Australian painter at that time. In 1927 she began almost twenty years of institutionalization in a mental asylum, however, and her death went without notice. After her death, information about her was frequently omitted from reference books about Australian painters and knowledge of her work became obscure despite her paintings being held in public art collections including the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20South%20Australia">Art Gallery of South Australia</a>, the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Western%20Australia">Art Gallery of Western Australia</a>, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>, the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a> and Australia's <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28Australia%29">National Portrait Gallery</a>.

Florence Fuller was born in <a href="Port%20Elizabeth">Port Elizabeth</a>, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters <a href="Amy%20Fuller%20%28singer%29">Amy</a> and <a href="Christie%20Fuller">Christie</a>, both of whom subsequently became singers.

The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria%20Art%20School">National Gallery of Victoria Art School</a> in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of <a href="Jane%20Sutherland">Jane Sutherland</a>, referred to in the "<a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a>" as "the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature".

Fuller's uncle was <a href="Robert%20Hawker%20Dowling">Robert Hawker Dowling</a>, a painter of <a href="orientalism">orientalist</a> and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for "Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines", a formal oil on canvas portrait of the <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous Australian</a> leader, <a href="William%20Barak">William Barak</a>. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed:
one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that "Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person".

In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England. Giving up her work as a governess, Fuller began to paint full-time, and had opened her own studio before she had turned twenty. Dowling had intended to return to Australia and had left behind an incomplete portrait of the Victorian governor's wife, Lady Loch. He died, however, not long after arriving in England; Fuller then completed Dowling's commission. Lady Loch became her patron. Other early portraits followed: two pictures of homeless children, entitled "Weary" (inspired by <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>'s poem on child labour "Weariness") and "Desolate", in 1888; and "Gently Reproachful" circa 1889. "Weary" was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2015. The gallery's curator of Australian art described the depiction of billboard posters in the painting as giving it a "sense of gritty realism that was arguably unprecedented in Australian art."

Also in 1889, Fuller was awarded a prize by the <a href="Victorian%20Artists%20Society">Victorian Artists Society</a> for best portrait by an artist under twenty-five.

In 1892, Fuller travelled to the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> "to convalesce", although from what illness or injury, her biographer Joan Kerr does not say. While there, she was a guest of her uncle Sir <a href="Thomas%20Ekins%20Fuller">Thomas Ekins Fuller</a>, a member of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope</a>, and through him she met <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>, the <a href="British%20Cape%20Colony">Colony</a>'s Prime Minister, who commissioned her to paint a landscape showing his home. Two years later, she travelled on to England and France, where she remained for a decade. In the 1890s, Australian artists studying abroad favoured Paris over London, and Fuller was no exception. Other Australians studying in France around that time included <a href="Agnes%20Goodsir">Agnes Goodsir</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Preston">Margaret Preston</a>, <a href="James%20Peter%20Quinn">James Quinn</a>, and <a href="Hugh%20Ramsay">Hugh Ramsay</a>. Fuller studied first at the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Julian">Académie Julian</a>, where her teachers included <a href="William-Adolphe%20Bouguereau">William-Adolphe Bouguereau</a>, and later, <a href="Rapha%C3%ABl%20Collin">Raphaël Collin</a>, one of whose studios she managed for a time. Many of the French art schools had only recently opened their doors to women, and those at Académie Julian experienced poor, overcrowded conditions and contempt from the (mostly male) teachers. Despite this, Fuller's skills developed, and contemporary critics commented favourably on the influence of the French training.

During her time in Europe, Fuller had great success. After a pastel portrait of hers was accepted for the <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Paris Salon</a> in 1895, two of her paintings were shown there in 1896. That was followed by another, "La Glaneuse", in 1897, in which year she also had a work accepted by the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> in London. She exhibited in many other locations: the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20Oil%20Painters">Royal Institute of Oil Painters</a> and <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a> in England, as well as the Victorian Artists Society and the New South Wales Society of Artists, and at the Melbourne studio of Jane Sutherland. There was even a painting, "Landscape", hung in the exhibition for the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of <a href="Bendigo">Bendigo</a>. Not all her time was spent in Europe, however; in 1899 she returned to South Africa to paint Cecil Rhodes. One source suggests that she ultimately prepared five portraits of the founder of Rhodesia. A later newspaper report stated that Fuller also travelled and made sketches in Wales, Ireland, and Italy.

While in Europe, Fuller painted "Inseparables", which portrays the figure of a girl sitting reading a book. It was acquired by the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20South%20Australia">Art Gallery of South Australia</a>. When hanging the work as part of its exhibition "The Edwardians", the National Gallery of Australia described the painting as one suggesting a love of reading. In contrast, art historian Catherine Speck regarded the work as "subversive" because of its portrayal of a young woman "gaining knowledge". In November 1902, the Australian Federal International Exhibition was held. It was opened by the <a href="Governor%20of%20Victoria">Governor of Victoria</a> <a href="George%20Clarke%2C%201st%20Baron%20Sydenham%20of%20Combe">Sir George Clarke</a>, who spoke of its goal to advance "the industrial progress of Australia". The event occupied the entire <a href="Royal%20Exhibition%20Building">Royal Exhibition Building</a> in Melbourne, and was dominated by an exhibition of art, both Australian and international. Included in this extensive survey of painting were six works by Fuller.

Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, "Summer Breezes", at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included <a href="Rupert%20Bunny">Rupert Bunny</a>, <a href="E.%20Phillips%20Fox">E. Phillips Fox</a>, <a href="Albert%20Henry%20Fullwood">Albert Fullwood</a>, <a href="George%20Washington%20Lambert">George Lambert</a>, and <a href="Arthur%20Streeton">Arthur Streeton</a>. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in "<a href="The%20West%20Australian">The West Australian</a>" observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.

By the time "Summer Breezes" was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to <a href="Perth">Perth</a> in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her "one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician <a href="James%20George%20Lee%20Steere">James George Lee Steere</a>, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Western%20Australia">gallery whose board he chaired</a>. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist <a href="Kathleen%20O%27Connor%20%28painter%29">Kathleen O'Connor</a>.

Fuller's paintings from this period included "A Golden Hour", described by the National Gallery of Australia as "a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history". The painting, an oil on canvas high and wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and "<a href="Xanthorrhoea">Xanthorrhoea</a>". When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the <a href="auction">auction</a> house catalogue stated that it had been owned by <a href="William%20Ride">William Ride</a>, former director of the <a href="Western%20Australian%20Museum">Western Australian Museum</a>. It reported:The current owners assert that Professor Ride always understood the figures in the picture were Sir <a href="John%20Winthrop%20Hackett">John Winthrop Hackett</a>, (then owner of "The West Australian" newspaper, well known business man and philanthropist, whose gift allowed the construction of the impressive University of Western Australia buildings and St. George's Residential College) and his new wife, <a href="Deborah%20Vernon%20Hackett">Deborah Vernon Hackett</a>".
In addition to appearing as the small figure of a woman in "A Golden Hour", Deborah Vernon Hackett was also the subject of a portrait, painted around 1908, again during Fuller's time in Perth. Anne Gray, the head of Australian art at the National Gallery of Australia, observed of Fuller's approach to the newspaperman's wife, that:Fuller portrayed her sitter sympathetically, capturing the young woman's grace and charm. But she also conveyed the complexity of the young Mrs Hackett's character through her soft, feminine, pale-blue dress counterpoised by the dramatic black hat and direct gaze.
Fuller painted other works for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece reflecting on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, and he was a constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase ... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.

Biographer Joan Kerr speculated that it may have been Jane Sutherland who introduced Fuller to <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">Theosophy</a>, a spiritual and <a href="mysticism">mystical</a> philosophy that teaches the unity of existence and emphasises the search for universal wisdom. Described by art historian Jenny McFarlane as "the most important counter-cultural organisation of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries", it was influential throughout Fuller's life. She joined the society in Perth on 29 May 1905, after hearing charismatic theosophist <a href="Charles%20Webster%20Leadbeater">Charles Webster Leadbeater</a> during his lecture tour. <a href="Bessie%20Rischbieth">Bessie Rischbieth</a> was a feminist who joined at the same time, and together they influenced the movement's development in early twentieth century Perth. Fuller was variously secretary, treasurer, and librarian of the local branch of the <a href="Theosophical%20Society">Theosophical Society</a>.

In 1906 Fuller's portrait of feminist and theosophist <a href="Annie%20Besant">Annie Besant</a> was among the paintings exhibited at the West Australian Art Society's annual exhibition. Around the same period, she painted other portraits of the movement's leading figures, including <a href="Henry%20Steel%20Olcott">Henry Steel Olcott</a> and <a href="Helena%20Petrovna%20Blavatsky">Helena Petrovna Blavatsky</a>. These representations departed from the academic portraiture in which Fuller had trained, as she incorporated practices of intuition and visualisation "inspired by Indian aesthetics as mediated by the Theosophical Society".

In 1907, Besant became the president of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at <a href="Adyar%2C%20Chennai">Adyar</a>, in what was then, <a href="Madras">Madras</a>. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent two and a half years in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society ... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.

Fuller's time at Adyar was eventful. Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he "discovered" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, <a href="Jiddu%20Krishnamurti">Jiddu Krishnamurti</a> (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and "Portrait of the Lord Buddha". McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is "strikingly modern" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by <a href="Grace%20Cossington%20Smith">Grace Cossington Smith</a> and <a href="Roland%20Wakelin">Roland Wakelin</a>, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject "through a psychic, visionary experience".

Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a> protests associated with the coronation of <a href="George%20V">George V</a>. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.
Fuller subsequently travelled from London to India in 1914. One newspaper report described her as a "visitor" to Sydney in 1916, although McFarlane says she travelled there with Leadbeater and remained in the city. Another report stated that she visited Brisbane a year later. Both newspaper pieces indicated that Fuller had spent a period painting in <a href="Java">Java</a> (at that time part of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>), although when this occurred is not clear, and such a visit is not mentioned by McFarlane. There was at least one subsequent substantial journey, as Fuller arrived again to Sydney, via Perth, from India in 1919. At some point following these travels, Fuller settled permanently in <a href="Mosman%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mosman</a> in Sydney's northern suburbs, where she continued to paint, including <a href="Portrait%20miniature">miniatures</a>. Her 1916 visit to Sydney had included an exhibition of a group of her miniatures, all of them portraits of theosophists including Besant and <a href="Henry%20Steel%20Olcott">Henry Olcott</a>, co-founder of the Theosophical Society.

In 1920, the Society of Women Painters in New South Wales established a School of Fine and Applied Arts, with Florence Fuller appointed as the inaugural teacher of <a href="figure%20drawing">life classes</a>. At the exhibition held to mark the school's establishment, Fuller displayed a portrait of the organisation's founder, Mrs Hedley Parsons. When the society held a show in 1926, a portrait by Fuller was one of those selected for favourable comment, but the general opinion of "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" reviewer was that "the exhibitors have let their style harden into a groove". Fuller continued to be associated with the theosophical community as her health and economic circumstances deteriorated.

In 1927, at the age of sixty, she was committed to <a href="Gladesville%20Mental%20Hospital">Gladesville Mental Asylum</a> (as it was then known), where she died nearly two decades later, on 17 July 1946. She was buried at <a href="Rookwood%20Cemetery">Rookwood Cemetery</a>.

Gwenda Robb and Elaine Smith, in their "Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists", considered Fuller's art to be created in "a free painterly style indebted to <a href="Impressionism">Impressionism</a>". During the first decade of the twentieth century, reviews drew attention to her distinctively Australian style. When one of Fuller's works was included in an exhibition of colonial artists in London (including paintings from Canada and Australia), the correspondent from the "<a href="Adelaide%20Advertiser">Adelaide Advertiser</a>" described Fuller's contribution as "most Australian in feeling". Reviewing her work hung in the Royal Academy in 1904, a Perth critic reported: "Of the 16 or 17 Australian artists exhibiting at the Academy, Miss Fuller was the only one who chose a typically Australian scene. Her picture shows a young girl in thin white, clinging, dress, standing on a bushy piece of country ... As the London "<a href="The%20Observer">Observer</a>" says, the atmosphere that bathes the graceful figure of the girl is capitally managed with its note of subtropical heat". One reviewer thought very highly of her portraits, but was less convinced about Fuller's approach to the Australian light, writing:She had less success with our landscapes than with her figure subjects. That was the result of her passion for toning her pictures for ultimate indoor hanging. Thereby she lost, or illuminated, the hard Australian, hard light and shade, and startling relative values. Observable too was the influence of the English school in her rendering of our foliage; never could she bring herself to see our trees as dim coloured as they usually are.
Art critic and curator Jenny McFarlane considered Fuller's work to be complex, drawing not only on European <a href="modernism">modernist</a> academic traditions and Australian subjects, but also at times, incorporating "radical stylistic innovations" that drew on Indian artistic tradition and theosophy's ideas.

Reviewing the Western Australian Art Society's exhibition in 1906, the critic for Perth's "<a href="Western%20Mail%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Western Mail</a>" considered Fuller's works to be the finest on show, and that "the occasion provides another triumph for Miss Fuller". In 1914, it was reported that Fuller was represented in four public galleries—three in Australia and one in South Africa—a record for an Australian woman painter at that time. Yet although she experienced considerable success during her early life, Fuller subsequently became almost invisible. No obituaries appeared in the newspapers in 1946. She is not mentioned at all in Janine Burke's "Australian Women Artists 1840–1940", <a href="Max%20Germaine">Max Germaine</a>'s "Dictionary of Women Artists in Australia", nor Caroline Ambrus's "Australian Women Artists". However her work toured with the Completing the picture: women artists and the Heidelberg era exhibition in 1992-1993 and also was discussed in detail and illustrated in Janda Gooding's "Western Australian art and artists, 1900-1950" exhibition and publication. In 2013, Ann Gray described Fuller as "an important Australian woman artist and arguably Western Australia's most significant artist from the Federation period". Works by Fuller are held by the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>, the City of Perth, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>, Australia's <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28Australia%29">National Portrait Gallery</a>, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the State Library of Victoria. Internationally, her work is held by the <a href="Newport%20Museum">Newport Museum and Art Gallery</a> in South Wales.

Cyclone Joy

Severe Tropical Cyclone Joy struck Australia in late 1990, causing the third highest floods on record in <a href="Rockhampton">Rockhampton</a>, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. This cyclone began as a weak <a href="low%20pressure%20area">tropical low</a> near the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, and initially moved westward. On 18 December, it was named Joy, becoming the 2nd <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> of the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Australian%20region%20cyclone%20season">1990–91 Australian region cyclone season</a>. After turning southwest, Joy developed a well-defined <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> and strengthened to <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of while approaching <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> in <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a>. Brushing the city with strong winds, the cyclone soon weakened and turned southeast. Joy later curved back southwest, making <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland on 26 December. It dissipated the next day; remnant moisture continued as torrential rainfall over Queensland for two weeks.

While drifting offshore northeastern Australia, the cyclone produced wind gusts as high as in Cairns, strong enough to cause power outages. In <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay</a>, a <a href="tornado">tornado</a> spawned by Joy damaged 40 homes, while torrential rainfall just south of the city peaked at over . Most storm-associated damage was wrought by severe flooding, which persisted for weeks in hardest-hit locations. Rains significantly increased water levels on 10 rivers, among them the <a href="Fitzroy%20River%20%28Queensland%29">Fitzroy River</a>, which <a href="discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharged</a> about of freshwater into <a href="Keppel%20Bay">Keppel Bay</a> over 25 days. In turn, the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> suffered biological damage from <a href="coral%20bleaching">coral bleaching</a> and decreased <a href="salinity">salinity</a>. The Fitzroy River rose to a peak at Rockhampton, forcing thousands to evacuate homes; some stranded individuals could only obtain food by helicopter. Elsewhere in Australia, storm moisture alleviated drought conditions and diminished fires near <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. Overall, Joy killed six people and caused 300 million in damage ($234 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). Afterwards, the Queensland government issued a disaster declaration for about 30% of the state, and the name Joy was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Australian%20cyclone%20names">retired</a> from the <a href="list%20of%20historic%20tropical%20cyclone%20names">list of tropical cyclone names</a>.

In mid-December, a <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> persisted along the west Pacific Ocean, spawning a pair of tropical disturbances both north and south of the equator. In the northwestern Pacific Ocean, the system became <a href="1990%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Typhoon%20Russ">Typhoon Russ</a>. On 15 December, a <a href="low%20pressure%20area">tropical low</a> formed east of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. During the next few days, the system passed south of the country while slowly organizing. On 18 December, the Australia <a href="Bureau%20of%20Meteorology">Bureau of Meteorology</a> began tracking it, <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">naming</a> the system "Joy" after it upgraded the low to <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">tropical cyclone status</a>. A meteorologist from <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> later apologised that the name was used so close to Christmas, although "Joy" was predetermined by a rotating list of <a href="list%20of%20historic%20tropical%20cyclone%20names">list of tropical cyclone names</a>. Also on 18 December, the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) began issuing warnings on the storm, labeling it as Tropical Cyclone 06P. With a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to the south, Joy continued generally west-southwestward.

While in its origins, Joy was experiencing upper-level <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, but as it approached the <a href="jet%20stream">jet stream</a> while turning to the southwest, conditions became more favourable for intensification. The storm quickly intensified, reaching the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on 21 December. At 00:00 UTC on 23 December, the Bureau estimated Joy reached peak <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">10-minute sustained winds</a> of , which made the system a category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the <a href="Australian%20tropical%20cyclone%20intensity%20scale">Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale</a>. Around the same time, the JTWC also estimated the same peak winds, but sustained over one minute. Joy developed an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> about in diameter with <a href="Eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">concentric eyewalls</a>. The storm began moving slowly off the northeast coast of Australia, passing within of Cairns, and the motion shifted to a southeast drift. A building <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">high pressure area</a> to the south caused the change in movement, and there were initial concerns the storm would loop to the west and affect Cairns again. Drier air caused Joy to weaken gradually from its peak to the equivalent of a strong tropical storm. At 06:00 UTC on 26 December, after turning back to the southwest, the storm made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, with winds estimated at . That day, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and on 27 December, Joy dissipated inland over Queensland. A remnant system persisted into early January, producing continued rainfall across Queensland.

Before Joy struck Australia, residents evacuated from resorts on <a href="Fitzroy%20Island%20%28Queensland%29">Fitzroy</a> and <a href="Green%20Island%20%28Queensland%29">Green</a> islands by boat or plane. Officials set up evacuation centres on the mainland and put the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> on standby. The military evacuated its fleet of <a href="Sikorsky%20UH-60%20Black%20Hawk">Blackhawk helicopters</a> inland from <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">RAAF Base Townsville</a>. A man required rescue from <a href="Hope%20Island%2C%20Queensland">Hope Island</a> by helicopter in advance of the storm. The threat of the storm caused shopping malls and the airport near Cairns to close just before Christmas. Several flights were diverted or delayed, stranding about 1,000 travellers, many of whom spent Christmas in the airport. Road travel was banned in some areas of northeastern Queensland, and residents in <a href="Port%20Douglas%2C%20Queensland">Port Douglas</a> were forced to evacuate. The Flood Warning Centre in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> issued 192 <a href="flood%20warning">flood warning</a>s related to Cyclone Joy in December and January, beginning on 23 December. Most of the warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers.

Joy passed within of Green Island off the coast of Queensland, generating a wind gust of . Heavy damage occurred on other islands, and one person drowned while surfing in <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay</a>. A boat became disabled during the storm, forcing its four occupants to ride out the storm for four days on <a href="South%20Cumberland%20Islands%20National%20Park">Cockermouth Island</a> until they were rescued by helicopter. Several boats were damaged in the <a href="Whitsunday%20Islands">Whitsunday Islands</a>.

The storm and its remnants dropped heavy rainfall throughout Queensland for about two weeks, totaling over south of Mackay and over between <a href="Bowen%2C%20Queensland">Bowen</a> and <a href="St%20Lawrence%2C%20Queensland">St. Lawrence</a>. The highest daily total was about west of <a href="Sarina%2C%20Queensland">Sarina</a>. Three day rainfall totals around when Joy made landfall included in Blue Mountain and in Waitara. Rainfall continued through the region through March 1991, resulting in the third largest flood in the region in over 100 years.

Overall, Cyclone Joy killed six people, including five in river flooding, and caused about 300 million in damage ($234 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). While stalling off the northeast Australia coast, Joy produced widespread <a href="gale">gale</a> force winds, with gusts to recorded at Cairns. After the winds knocked over trees, causing power and phone outages, storm damage cut the water supply and briefly isolated Cairns due to debris blocking roads. An outer rainband struck Mackay as the storm moved ashore, spawning a tornado that damaged 40 houses, destroyed two others, and damaged a <a href="RV%20park">caravan park</a>. The windstorm was unexpected there, and damage in Mackay was estimated at 10 million. Flooding from rainfall affected about 90% of the city, which restricted train travel, causing three trains to be canceled and stranding hundreds of travelers. In Port Douglas, Joy produced an inconsequential <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> of . In Innisfail, the cyclone ruined 90% of the town's crops, and over 20 houses sustained wind damage. Banana farmers in the Cairns region lost a combined total of 1.2 million bunches of the fruit. Collectively, crop damage totalled over 70 million, mostly to sugar cane and banana. About 30,000 head of livestock were killed in the region.

Rain from Cyclone Joy caused rampant flooding across the region, significantly raising water levels along 10 rivers. The Fitzroy River alone swelled to inundate about of terrain. Heightened discharge caused extensive erosion along river channels that removed about of soil and vegetation. In late December, the <a href="Pioneer%20River">Pioneer River</a> at Mackay peaked at , safely within the confines of its levee system. The town of <a href="Giru%2C%20Queensland">Giru</a> endured flooding of streets and houses, which would reoccur several times through February. High water levels along the <a href="Tully%20River">Tully River</a> flooded a portion of the <a href="Bruce%20Highway">Bruce Highway</a>. In the second week of January, the <a href="Herbert%20River">Herbert River</a> peaked at , causing residential flooding in <a href="Ingham%2C%20Queensland">Ingham</a>. Elsewhere in Australia, moisture from the storm eased ongoing bushfires near <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>.

At <a href="Rockhampton">Rockhampton</a>, the Fitzroy River rose to an initial peak of , temporarily dropped, and rose to a final peak of in early January 1991, the third highest since records began in 1860, after floods in 1918 and 1954. Inflow from several tributaries ensured the Fitzroy River near Rockhampton remained over for 13 days. The river entered 350 houses in what was the city's most damaging flood since 1954. The town was isolated for about three weeks after flooding covered roads, railways, and the airport. Before the worst of the flooding, Acting <a href="Premier%20of%20Queensland">Premier</a> <a href="Tom%20Burns%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Tom Burns</a> declared a state of disaster for Rockhampton, giving local police the authority to force individuals living in flood zones to leave their homes. Ultimately, over 1,000 people sought higher ground, staying mainly at the houses of friends or relatives, or at nearby schools. In an attempt to mitigate damage, 150 volunteers filled 43,000 sandbags to protect properties. Nearby, residents rescued about 100 dogs from an affected kennel.

Storm-related flooding damaged portions of the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> through <a href="coral%20bleaching">coral bleaching</a>. Over 25 days, the <a href="Fitzroy%20River%20%28Queensland%29">Fitzroy River</a> <a href="discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharged</a> about of water into <a href="Keppel%20Bay">Keppel Bay</a>, reaching the Great Barrier Reef in early January and causing a drop in salinity levels. On <a href="Great%20Keppel%20Island">Great Keppel Island</a>, about 85% of shallow-water reefs died. Reef damage also occurred in the Whitsunday Islands. The discharge from the Fitzroy River affected various islands and coral groups, depending on the offshore wind direction and ocean current. The water flow washed a group of freshwater turtles from the mainland to <a href="North%20West%20Island">North West Island</a>, though they were later returned to their native habitat. The influx of freshwater reduced commercial fishing productivity by 30%.

Workers in Cairns had restored power and water supplies within a few days of Joy's passage. After the initial flooding from Joy ended, there was additional rainfall in February 1991 that caused flooding across the region. Residual flooding cost the coal industry about 60 million due to loss of production and hindered exporting. While Rockhampton was still isolated by flooding, a helicopter airdropped food to hundreds of stranded families, after the town experienced food and water shortages. Transportation to Rockhampton was not normalised until 20 January, when the airport and incoming roads were reopened. The city of Rockhampton later created a flood plain management policy as a result of the effects from Joy. The floods helped fill the <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> of the <a href="Peter%20Faust%20Dam">Peter Faust Dam</a> within a few weeks, speeding up a process which would have otherwise taken several years. Months after the storm, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service collected reports on environmental impacts from the flooding; they included some beneficial aspects such as new locations for animal breeding, and alleviation of drought conditions. The Queensland government upgraded a portion of the Bruce Highway near Rockhampton to reduce flooding in similar storms.

Officials declared about a third of the state of Queensland as a disaster area following Cyclone Joy, directing state funds toward recovery efforts. The Queensland government provided monetary assistance to eligible families in the disaster zone and offered special loans to farmers affected by the storm. The federal government agreed to contribute 75% of overall relief costs. Following the cyclone's impacts in Australia, the name Joy was later <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Australian%20cyclone%20names">retired</a> by the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a>.

<doc id="40986946" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40986946" title="Franklin Peale">
Franklin Peale

Benjamin Franklin Peale (born Aldrovand Peale; October 15, 1795 – May 5, 1870) was an employee and officer of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> from 1833 to 1854. Although Peale introduced many innovations to the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a>, he was eventually dismissed amid allegations he had used his position for personal gain.

Peale was the son of painter <a href="Charles%20Willson%20Peale">Charles Willson Peale</a>, and was born in the museum of curiosities that his father ran in Philadelphia. For the most part, Franklin Peale's education was informal, though he took some classes at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. He became adept in machine making. In 1820, he became an assistant to his father at the museum, and managed it after Charles Peale's death in 1827.

In 1833, Peale was hired by the Mint, and was sent for two years to Europe to study and report back on coining techniques. He returned with plans for improvement, and designed the first steam-powered coinage press in the United States, installed in 1836. Peale was made Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint that year, and Chief Coiner three years later upon the retirement of the incumbent, <a href="Adam%20Eckfeldt">Adam Eckfeldt</a>, who continued in his work without pay. Eckfeldt's labor allowed Peale to run a medal business using Mint property. This sideline eventually caused Peale's downfall: conflicts with Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a> and Melter and Refiner <a href="Richard%20Sears%20McCulloh">Richard Sears McCulloh</a> led to Peale being accused of misconduct, and he was dismissed by President <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> in 1854.

In retirement, Peale continued his involvement in and leadership of many civic organizations; he died in 1870. Numismatic author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> suggests that the facts of Peale's career allow writers to draw very different conclusions about him.

Benjamin Franklin Peale was born October 15, 1795, to painter <a href="Charles%20Willson%20Peale">Charles Willson Peale</a> and his second wife, the former Elizabeth de Peyster. As well as pursuing his art, Charles Peale ran a museum of curiosities housed in <a href="Philosophical%20Hall">Philosophical Hall</a> in Philadelphia, home of the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Society">American Philosophical Society</a>. The boy was born in the family quarters in the museum. He was given the name Aldrovand, after the Italian naturalist <a href="Ulisse%20Aldrovandi">Ulisse Aldrovandi</a>.

Charles Peale recorded family births on the flyleaf of a copy of <a href="Matthew%20Pilkington">Matthew Pilkington</a>'s "Dictionary of Painters", rather than in a Bible, and after recording "Aldrovand" added the notation, "if he likes that name when he comes of age". The father was a member of the American Philosophical Society, and in February 1796 brought his young son to a meeting, and asked the members to select another name for the child. They decided on Benjamin Franklin Peale, naming the boy after the Society's founder, <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. Society legend holds that the boy was given the name while placed in the chair of the president of the Society, which had been donated by Franklin.
Franklin Peale was one of sixteen children his father would have by his three wives. Elizabeth Peale died when Franklin was eight years old, but his father soon remarried, and the child was thereafter cared for by his stepmother. He was given little classroom education, though he did spend some time at a local school in nearby <a href="Bucks%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bucks County</a>, as well as at <a href="Germantown%20Academy">Germantown Academy</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. For the most part, his education was informal, as was usual in the Peale family, with the student given the means to study what interested him, or what he appeared to be good at. In Franklin Peale's case, he made toys as a boy, and surveyed his father's farm near <a href="Germantown%2C%20Philadelphia">Germantown</a>. Although he lacked the artistic talent of some of his brothers, such as <a href="Titian%20Peale">Titian Peale</a>, he proved mechanically inclined.

At age 17, Peale began to work for the Delaware cotton factory of William Young, on the <a href="Brandywine%20River">Brandywine River</a>, learning the making of machines. He was an apt student, becoming adept as a <a href="turning">turner</a>, <a href="foundry">founder</a>, and <a href="draftsman">draftsman</a>. He was tolerated in his desire for a mechanical career by his father, who considered it a foolish whim. Within a year, one of the Hodgson brothers, who ran a nearby machine shop, described Peale as highly capable with tools. At age 19 Peale returned to Germantown, where, having designed and supervised the installation of the machinery for a cotton factory there, he was put in charge, and continued to manage the factory for several years. He then moved to nearby Philadelphia, and worked for the firm of John & Coleman Sellers, which made machinery for card sticking.
On April 24, 1815, Peale, still a minor at age 19, married Eliza Greatrake without his father's consent. Almost immediately, it became evident she had mental problems. Although Eliza bore Peale a child within the first year of the marriage (a daughter, Anna), she thereafter left him, returning to live with her mother, who had her committed to Pennsylvania Hospital as a "lunatic". The Peale family began a lengthy effort to show that Eliza Peale was mad when she married Franklin, a ground for <a href="annulment">annulment</a>. With aid from the testimony of Captain <a href="Allen%20McLane">Allen McLane</a>, they were successful, and the annulment was granted on March 22, 1820. Franklin Peale was required to post assets as security for the support of his former wife; his sister Sophy lent him some of her stock in the museum for that purpose.

In 1820, Peale left factory management to assist his aging father in running the museum, and remained there for over a decade. When Charles Willson Peale died in 1827, Franklin became the manager of the museum, and like his siblings, inherited stock in it. He not only maintained the exhibits, but added to them, contributing a "curious speaking toy" as well as the model for an early locomotive, which was used to draw two small cars in the museum, with seating for four people. At the time, the museum was located in the Old State House (today, <a href="Independence%20Hall">Independence Hall</a>), and Peale worked out a system for using the State House bell to inform fire companies of the location of a blaze.
Peale was one of the founders of <a href="The%20Franklin%20Institute">The Franklin Institute</a> in 1824, one of several mechanics' institutes that came into being in the early 1820s to provide working men with technical education. It quickly became important and influential, organizing an exhibition of American manufactured goods that October, one of at least 26 such shows that it put on in the first 34 years of its existence. Peale taught natural history, mechanics (illustrating his lectures with models and drawings), and chemistry, livening the talks with experiments. He was for many years actively involved with The Franklin Institute, writing articles for its "Journal" and serving on key committees.

The second building to house the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> opened in 1833, with up-to-date technology except in the coining process. For this, it used the transplanted machinery of its predecessor, using human muscle power to strike coins. Although the Mint wanted all coins to be identical to others of the same denomination, the use of the screw press was an impediment to this, as the force used to impress the design on the coins was not uniform. Additionally, the coinage dies were made by hand, leading to differences between coins of the same year struck from different dies. This state of affairs was unsatisfactory to the director, <a href="Samuel%20Moore%20%28congressman%29">Samuel Moore</a>, who had for several years contemplated purchasing a modern set of steam machinery for the production of coins from the <a href="Soho%20Mint">Soho Mint</a> in Birmingham, England, founded by coining pioneer <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a>. Moore instead decided to engage a new employee and send him on a special tour of European mints and refineries, in order to learn the best features of each and bring the knowledge home for use at the Philadelphia facility. The individual would be given the title of Assistant to the Assayer, <a href="Jacob%20R.%20Eckfeldt">Jacob R. Eckfeldt</a>. Moore obtained the approval of Treasury Secretary <a href="Louis%20McLane">Louis McLane</a> and an appropriation of $7,000 for the purpose.

Moore, in a letter to McLane, noted that sending an agent to Europe to gather technology had been discussed in the past, but proposals had foundered over the difficulty of finding a person both competent enough to undertake the trip successfully and not too busy to spend a year or more in Europe. At the recommendation of the director's first cousin, <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a>, Moore hired Peale for the position. According to Patterson, "I do not know any man more likely to succeed in such a mission. His skill, his perseverance, his address all fit him for the errand." Peale was willing to go, writing, "a variety of circumstances render me very desirous of vacating the situation that I have held for many years as Manager of the Phil Museum, it will therefore be agreeable to change even at a pecuniary sacrifice."

Peale departed from New York for <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> on May 8, 1833, arriving in Paris late in the month. At this time, it was only certain that Peale would visit Paris—a visit to England, with instruction at local mints and refineries, was still under discussion. Peale had been instructed to learn "parting," a newly developed method for separating gold and silver. This process, also dubbed refining, is necessary because nuggets that contain gold also contain some silver, and the latter metal must be removed before the gold can be alloyed with copper for coining. The older method of removing silver involved the use of <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric</a> and <a href="sulphuric%20acid">sulphuric acid</a>s, and was dangerous and expensive. Director Moore also instructed Peale to gain the method of <a href="metallurgical%20assay">assaying</a> silver by the "humid process" (<a href="titration">titration</a>), and to learn everything he could of coining technology and how it was powered by steam. Moore warned, "a very material object of your mission is to be regarded as unaccomplished, until you have become familiar with everything requisite for directing the formation of an establishment "de novo" [from nothing] ... and until you shall have acquired a good share of adroitness in the actual manipulations ... Whatever can be added to our information in regard to the treatment of the precious metals, and Mint processes and machinery is within the scope of your inquiries." Moore asked that, if Peale had any time remaining, to look into other technologies that might be useful to the United States, such as the <a href="Gas%20lighting">gas illumination</a> of cities.

With the aid of the <a href="United%20States%20Minister%20to%20France">United States Minister to France</a>, <a href="Edward%20Livingston">Edward Livingston</a>, Peale gained permission to study closely the workings of the "<a href="Monnaie%20de%20Paris">Monnaie de Paris</a>". The staff there was cooperative, and Peale was able to learn the "humid" method from watching the assayer as he verified the silver content of the coins from the French branch mints. Peale's notes were supplemented by detailed engravings of all the fixtures used in the process, published and sold by the Paris mint at an expense of 98 francs 50 centimes, which Peale deemed worth the purchase on the US government's behalf. Peale also purchased a set of the apparatus for the humid method, made and sold by the mint; Peale paid 500 francs for this.

Some of the machinery that would be installed on Peale's return to Philadelphia was based on what he saw in Paris. He sketched the "Monnaie de Paris"'s Thonnelier model coin presses. He also copied the Paris facility's "Tour á portrait" <a href="reducing%20lathe">reducing lathe</a>. He could not learn parting there as the facility contracted the process to private refineries; attempts to gain permission to learn the process at these facilities failed when their owners demanded huge sums, believing that Peale, as a government agent, was flush with money.

Peale journeyed to London, hoping that Moore's connections could get him instruction in the parting process. Although he visited the <a href="Royal%20Mint">Royal Mint</a>, he found officials there unhelpful and unwilling to teach him. In England, Peale studied the method of assaying via the humid process at Percival N. Johnson's refinery, and in 1835 introduced it to the Philadelphia Mint, replacing assaying by <a href="cupellation">cupellation</a>. Peale wrote that he "cannot speak in too high terms of Mr. Percival Johnson ... I have derived much useful information in his refinery particularly his method of separating silver, gold and paladium [palladium] by a shortened process". While in London, Peale ordered a delicate balance scale from his friend, expatriate American <a href="Joseph%20Saxton">Joseph Saxton</a>, and later induced Saxton to return to the United States and work for the Philadelphia Mint.

Peale returned to France where, as the refiners wanted payment for teaching him the French method of parting, he learned it by observing the assayer at the branch mint in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>. He was not completely happy with this, as he was not allowed to practice it himself, or to experiment, but felt that he could reproduce what he had seen on his return to Philadelphia. Peale also visited the German mints of Dresden, Stuttgart, and Karlsruhe. In Germany, parting was done in iron vessels; although Peale noted these were cheaper than platinum ones, he preferred the latter, writing in December 1834 that use of iron "sometimes leads to losses that are embarrassing." He also visited <a href="Freiberg">Freiberg</a>, in Saxony, observing the smelting and refining of lead ore.

On June 17, 1835, Peale submitted his report to Moore, 276 pages of his observations at the various European mints he had visited, and his comments and recommendations. He warned, "in the organization of Mints in both France and England that there are offices and incumbents, that are useless, and who render no services of importance for their appointment". He recommended favorably the French practice of not appointing a coin designer, but having competitions judged jointly by Mint officers and by artists. Peale also urged the passage of a single, comprehensive Mint Act, to replace the scattered bits of legislation passed over the years; this was done in 1837. One recommendation submitted by Peale, but not adopted, was to have the Mint set up a guaranty department, to <a href="hallmark">hallmark</a> items made of gold or silver by the private sector as public assurance of their quality, as done by the <a href="Goldsmiths%20Company">Goldsmiths Company</a> in London. He also recommended that the Philadelphia Mint strike medals, as did its French counterpart. He suggested that the Mint establish a museum of coins and coining, as the Paris facility had.
Peale returned from Europe with plans he had drawn for a steam-powered coinage press, borrowing the steam machinery design from English mints and the <a href="Linkage%20%28mechanical%29%23Other%20interesting%20linkages">toggle joint</a> technology from French ones. In September, Patterson, by then Mint Director in place of the retired Moore, wrote to Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Levi%20Woodbury">Levi Woodbury</a>, "we have just completed under the superintendence of Mr. Peale, a model of a coining press from plans which he saw in successful operation in France and in Germany, and possessing many very manifest advantages over the Screw press now applied at the Mint. Among these one of the most important is that [it] admits the immediate and easy application of steam power." Director Patterson called March 23, 1836 "an epoch in our coinage". To take advantage of the new press's increased production capacity, Peale designed a new machine to cut <a href="planchet">planchet</a>s, or blanks, from metal strips. This machine remained in use, almost unmodified, until 1902.

Another of the steam-powered machines Peale had installed on his return was a milling machine, which was used to "upset" the coin—to form a rim around it. A Contamin portrait lathe was imported from France and installed at the Philadelphia Mint in 1837. Prior to this time, all coin dies for American coins had to be made individually, by hand at Philadelphia. Once the lathe was installed, they could be reproduced mechanically by the <a href="pantograph">pantograph</a>-like device.
The first pieces produced by steam power at the Philadelphia Mint, commemorative medals, were struck on March 23, 1836. The first steam press there then began minting <a href="Large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">cents</a>, with silver and gold coinage first struck there by steam towards the end of the year. Built by the Philadelphia firm of Merrick, Agnew, and Taylor to Peale's design, the press was able to coin 100 pieces per minute. After being retired from government service, the press was used at The Franklin Institute to strike miniature medals for many years, and in 2000 was moved to the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>'s Money Museum in Colorado Springs. Patterson wrote, 
Numismatist Roger Burdette notes, "in most respects, Peale seems to have selected the best from European examples, and discarded all unnecessary complexity and ineffective motion." Although minor improvements were made from time to time, these machines struck the nation's coinage for the remainder of Peale's life.

According to numismatist David Lange, "the fact-finding journey of [future] Philadelphia Mint Melter and Refiner Franklin Peale through the mints of Europe from 1833 to 1835 assured that United States coins would be second to none in terms of technology." Lange, in his history of the Mint, notes that though Peale ended his career by being fired amid accusations of impropriety, upon his return from Europe, "he was the bearer of many innovations devised in the mints of Europe and now made available to the United States Mint at Philadelphia".
Robert Patterson III, son of the Mint Director under whom Peale served for many years, wrote that through Peale's report, "our Mint was placed in full possession of all that was then worthy to be known" from foreign mints and refineries. Patterson indicated that he had often thought, as he passed through the Philadelphia Mint's coining department, that a plaque should be set up to Peale reproducing the tribute to Sir <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a> in London's <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St. Paul's Cathedral</a>, "Si Monumentum Requiris, Circumspice" (if you seek his monument, look around you).

<a href="Joseph%20Cloud">Joseph Cloud</a> had held the position of Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint since 1797. The Washington administration appointee resigned, effective at the start of 1836. Peale was nominated as Cloud's replacement by President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> on December 21, 1835, and was confirmed by the Senate on January 5, 1836.
On taking office as Melter and Refiner, Peale implemented the changes he had recommended based on what he had seen in Europe. He also wanted additional mechanization in the mint's Coining Department, headed by Chief Coiner <a href="Adam%20Eckfeldt">Adam Eckfeldt</a>, whose son Jacob was the Philadelphia Mint's Assayer. Adam Eckfeldt had helped strike some of the first federal coins in 1792 and had been in his office since 1814. Eckfeldt was reluctant to adopt all Peale's recommendations, telling Peale's nephew, engineer <a href="George%20Sellers">George Sellers</a>, "If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down ... he wants something better and no doubt he would have it if we were starting anew." As improvements crept in despite Eckfeldt's caution, the Chief Coiner saw their value and became more enthusiastic, noting the savings in working time afforded by the Contamin lathe, which had been imported from France after being seen by Peale there. To help deal with the increased output from the Philadelphia Mint, Peale invented a piling-box, allowing planchets or coins to be quickly stacked, and a counting board, speeding the work of the clerks. The counting board remained in use until the mints installed mechanical counters in 1934.

One of the innovations that Peale introduced as Melter and Refiner was the use of salt in parting, using it to recover the silver dissolved in nitric acid when gold bullion was being purified. Previously, this could only be done by using copper, a process that generated dangerous and offensive fumes. Table salt (sodium chloride), dissolved in nitric acid, caused silver chloride to precipitate, which could be recovered as metallic silver through the use of zinc and sulfuric acid. This was a further refinement of the parting process; the director of the "Monnaie de Paris", <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Gay-Lussac">Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac</a>, had first used a salt solution as an easy, accurate means of assaying silver. A Senate report in 1873 stated that Peale's advancement of this process "attests to his genius, enterprise, and high attainments". When there were calls in Congress in 1836 for a <a href="two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%29">two-cent piece</a> to be made of debased silver, or <a href="billon%20%28alloy%29">billon</a>, Patterson had Peale, working with Second Engraver <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>, strike <a href="pattern%20coins">pattern coins</a> to show that the coins would be easily counterfeited using base metals.

In 1835, Congress had authorized branch mints at <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, <a href="Dahlonega%2C%20Georgia">Dahlonega, Georgia</a>, and <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, to strike into American coin the gold being mined in or entering the country through the South. Despite the rich gold deposits nearby, both Charlotte and Dahlonega were in areas lacking men with technical training; accordingly trained personnel would have to be sent from Philadelphia. New buildings were to be constructed. In August 1837, Mint Director Patterson received word of problems at both sites, including a partial collapse of the Dahlonega building. He wrote to Treasury Secretary <a href="Levi%20Woodbury">Levi Woodbury</a>, proposing "to send, to both the Gold mints, a confidential & skillful person, who may ... give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been committed ... I know of no one competent to this task, except our Melter & Refiner, Mr. Peale." Woodbury agreed, informing Patterson, "you are authorized to send Mr. Peak."

Peale, accompanied by his daughter Anna, arrived in Charlotte on September 23, 1837. He found that necessary equipment had not yet arrived, and without it he could do little. Peale ordered a search made, and reported to Patterson that he was "in a trap" in "this fag end of creation" in a town where "the only active beings are the hogs". Peale spent time visiting the mines on which the <a href="Charlotte%20Mint">Charlotte Mint</a> would rely for bullion. He proposed to Patterson that he continue to New Orleans after Dahlonega, to which the Mint Director replied that he would "exercise my "veto" upon your proposed long delay" and "your presence [in Philadelphia] cannot be dispensed with". On October 27, much of the missing equipment arrived in Charlotte, and Peale was able to complete his mission there and leave for Dahlonega on November 10. Following a difficult journey over primitive mountain roads, Franklin and Anna Peale arrived there on November 15. After assessing the problems at the nascent <a href="Dahlonega%20Mint">Dahlonega Mint</a>, Peale reported to Patterson,

Nevertheless, Peale recommended that construction on the building continue, as he deemed Congress unlikely to pass another appropriation for construction. The Peales left Dahlonega at the end of November. On their way north, Anna was slightly injured when the train in which they were riding though Virginia derailed. Peale was back at his desk at the Philadelphia Mint on December 23, 1837.

Roger Burdette discusses the influence Peale had on the Mint in the 1830s:

When Adam Eckfeldt retired in 1839, he recommended Peale as his successor. As the Senate was not sitting, Peale was given a <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a> as Chief Coiner of the Philadelphia Mint by President <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> on March 27, 1839. On January 23, 1840, after the Senate reconvened, Van Buren nominated Peale; the Senate gave its approval on February 17. Despite his retirement, Eckfeldt continued to come to the mint every day until shortly before his death in February 1852, performing the function of Chief Coiner and leaving Peale with time on his hands.

Soon after his appointment, Peale began to engage in a private business on the Mint's premises. He did this by designing, striking and selling medals for private commission, using government property and labor, and the Philadelphia Mint's facilities. Peale's enterprise was very profitable, as his expenses were minimal. This activity took place with the knowledge of the other officers of the Philadelphia Mint, most of whom were Peale's friends and relatives. Clients included corporations as well as one couple celebrating a 50th wedding anniversary. According to Robert E. Wright in his history of Philadelphia as an early financial center, the legality of Peale's business was unclear, but "the uncertainty of the situation made it almost inevitable that someone would make a stink on [Philadelphia's] Chestnut Street."

This activity has been variously characterized by numismatic writers. According to coin dealer and numismatic author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, "Peale started to abuse his position and privileges, in effect stealing services from the government". Burdette notes, "Overall, it appears that Peale used mint equipment and employees to make medals as instructed by Congress and the mint director, and to produce copies from private and official dies for sale to anyone who was interested. In the case of private sales, Peale seems to have used government metal, then reimbursed the bullion accounts when he collected for the medal. Profits were not accounted for in mint ledgers and it is unknown how much went to Peale, others at the mint or into the mint's Cabinet of Coins. The total amount was probably not large."

After scalemaker Saxton left the Mint Service in 1844, much of the work of maintaining and modifying the sensitive balances for which Saxton was responsible fell to Peale. The Chief Coiner made a number of improvements to the scales, which he wrote up for an article in the "Journal of The Franklin Institute" in 1847. These balances, sensitive to , were protected by plate glass from air currents and dust.

In 1844, Engraver Gobrecht died, and was replaced by <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>. The new incumbent had obtained his appointment through the influence of South Carolina Senator <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>. He had no relationship to the families that dominated the Philadelphia Mint, such as the Pattersons and Eckfeldts, and the connection with the Southerner Calhoun was objectionable to Peale, Patterson, and their associates. They would have preferred no replacement for Gobrecht, with the New York engraver <a href="Charles%20Cushing%20White">Charles Cushing White</a> or others they knew and trusted brought in on contract as necessary. This would ensure Peale's highly profitable medal business was not threatened. Additionally, Longacre had no training, prior to his appointment, in coin or medal design, being a successful plate engraver, and Lange states that the Mint officers were "understandably" prejudiced against him.
Peale sometimes worked on medals for the government, taking care to exclude Longacre from the process. During the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>, Congress voted a gold medal to Major General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> for his victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Palo%20Alto">Palo Alto</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Resaca%20de%20la%20Palma">Resaca de la Palma</a>. Peale engraved the design from a portrait by William Carl Brown and a model by John T. Battin. After Taylor became president, Peale designed his <a href="Indian%20Peace%20Medal">Indian Peace Medal</a>; Peale also engraved Indian Peace Medals for presidents <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> and <a href="James%20Polk">James Polk</a>, working from designs or models by other men. In 1846, Peale designed and engraved the Coast Survey Medal (also called the George M. Bache medal). Peale believed that all national commemorative medals, those authorized by Congress, should have their dies lodged at the Philadelphia Mint, and be struck there, and with Patterson's support urged the issuance of medals for presidents for whom no Indian Peace Medal had been designed, such as <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> and <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>. This was done, but not in Peale's time—for example, the William Henry Harrison medal was designed by later Assistant and Chief Engraver <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>. These works, like Peale's Indian Peace Medals, form part of the Mint's Presidential series, which continues to the present day.

Peale's improvements had made it possible for dies to be reproduced mechanically, relieving the Mint's Engraver of much of his routine duties. In the absence of a need for new designs or denominations, Longacre had little to do but add the dates to dies. Some of these insertions were blundered, and modern-day numismatic scholars, such as <a href="R.%20W.%20Julian">R. W. Julian</a>, have wondered if, as Peale and those who worked under him also sometimes inserted dates into dies, these mistakes were done intentionally in an attempt to bring discredit on Longacre. Nevertheless, Longacre's first few years at the Philadelphia Mint passed without serious conflict with Peale. All this changed in 1849, when Congress authorized a <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> and a <a href="Liberty%20Head%20double%20eagle">double eagle</a> ($20 piece). This made Longacre the center of attention at the mint, as he would be responsible for producing the new designs and dies. It also brought him into direct conflict with Peale: the Engraver would need to use the Contamin lathe, which was necessary to Peale's medal business. Peale sought to sabotage Longacre's attempts, with the goal of having him dismissed, and such work contracted for outside the government, allowing the medal business to continue undisturbed. In this, Peale had the support of Director Patterson.

As Longacre worked to complete the two new coins, he had to deal with interference from Peale. In early 1849, according to a letter written by Longacre the following year, the Engraver was approached by a member of the Mint staff, warning him that another officer (plainly Peale) sought to have the engraving work done outside the Mint, making Longacre redundant. Longacre's response to the information was to spend much of March 1849 preparing the dies for the gold dollar, at some cost to his health, as he later related. Longacre proceeded with work on the double eagle through late 1849, and described the obstacles set in his path by Peale:

According to numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, "under the circumstances, Peale's adoption of a process not normally used at the Mint, together with its catastrophic failure, seems more than coincidental." When Longacre completed the double eagle dies, they were rejected by Peale, who stated that the design was engraved too deeply to fully impress the coin, and the pieces would not stack properly. Taxay, however, noted that the one surviving 1849 double eagle displays no such problems, and by appearance would be level in a stack. Peale complained to Patterson, who wrote to Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20M.%20Meredith">William M. Meredith</a> asking for Longacre's removal on December 25, 1849, on the ground he could not make proper dies. Meredith was apparently willing to have Longacre fired, but relented after the Engraver journeyed to Washington and met with him personally.

Beginning in 1849, there were calls for a silver <a href="three-cent%20piece">three-cent piece</a>, and pattern coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint. Longacre's design featured a shield within a six-pointed star on one side. Peale offered a competing design, showing a <a href="pileus%20%28hat%29">Liberty cap</a>, very similar to one Gobrecht had made in 1836 when a gold dollar had been proposed. Patterson preferred Peale's design, but reluctantly endorsed Longacre's, since it was in lower relief and could be struck more easily, and Treasury Secretary <a href="Thomas%20Corwin">Thomas Corwin</a> approved the Engraver's work. The three-cent piece went into circulation in 1851.

In 1850, with the Mint faced with a vast increase in gold deposits due to the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, Peale suggested that the Mint hire women to supplement the staff assigned to weigh and adjust gold planchets, or coin blanks, describing the work as "being entirely suited to their capacity". The Mint did hire 40 women, who were (as of 1860) paid $1.10 per ten-hour day, a sum considered generous. The Mint's hiring of women was the first time the American government had employed women to fill specific jobs at regular wages.

In 1851, Peale designed a new steam engine for the Philadelphia Mint, using a "steeple" design without exterior pipes. Although designed to generate 100 horsepower, wear soon reduced its capacity. American journals of engineering mentioned Peale's latest work without comment; British journals pointed out the defects and suggested that time had passed Peale by.

Not all of Peale's innovations were successful. He caused the Mint to purchase a large lathe for <a href="turning">turning</a> heavy metal rolls, which cost the government at least $2,000 and that Peale conceded had never worked and likely never would. He bought from his nephew, George Sellers, a set of molds for casting ingots and accompanying equipment, which proved unusable as they were not adapted to the Mint's machinery. A drawbench made by Peale at the cost of at least $1,500 proved dangerous as the piston would drive with tremendous force against the end of its cylinder, causing a concussion and endangering those nearby. "Peale's machine gun" was put aside by Mint staff as useless soon after its introduction. An 1853 attempt by Peale to convert the Philadelphia Mint's wood-burning annealing furnaces to use anthracite coal destroyed the furnaces, cost the government several thousand dollars, and led to Peale being ordered to undertake no more such projects. One invention that worked well was the "noisy sofa"—sitting on it set off a trumpet blast. Constructed at the cost of about $200 in government funds, it graced in turn the offices of Peale and Patterson.
These activities were financed through a provision of the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201837">Mint Act of 1837</a> that Patterson interpreted to allow the Mint to decline to give credit for small amounts of silver in gold deposits. This practice was twice approved by the then-Secretary of the Treasury, in 1837 and 1849. Small deposits of bullion were rounded down to be divisible by $5, with the surplus kept and used at the discretion of Mint officials. This, and similar practices whereby officials financed activities without an appropriation from Congress, were brought to an end after Peale proposed a $20,800 renovation of part of the Philadelphia Mint building in 1850, and ran over budget by $12,000. To pay this, Patterson used the profits, or <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a>, projected to be made from the new three-cent pieces. When Congress heard of this, it passed the Act of February 21, 1853, requiring the Mint Director to regularly pay the seignorage into the Treasury.

One flaw in Peale's medal business was his need to acquire gold and silver bullion within the Mint. This was paid for once the medal sold, and there was no problem while the Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint was Peale's friend <a href="Jonas%20R.%20McClintock">Jonas R. McClintock</a>. But in 1846, McClintock resigned and was replaced by <a href="Richard%20Sears%20McCulloh">Richard Sears McCulloh</a>. At first, McCulloh gave Peale whatever gold and silver he needed without question, but came to object to doing so. Peale and McCulloh made a deal whereby the struck medal would remain in McCulloh's custody until Peale had replaced the bullion, but Peale objected that the procedure was "inconvenient". Beginning in August 1849, McCulloh refused further requests from Peale for bullion, and Peale instead gained it from the Mint's Treasurer.

Peale did his best to make McCulloh's position difficult, such as refusing to accept bullion for coins except from McCulloh personally. In 1850, McCulloh resigned. In November of that year, the former official published an article in the "<a href="New%20York%20Evening%20Express">New York Evening Express</a>" alleging that those employed at the Mint had transformed "it into a workshop for their gain". President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> sent the article to Secretary of the Treasury Corwin for an explanation; Corwin forwarded it to Patterson, who confirmed that Peale was running a private medal business on the premises, but stated that there was no interference with the performance of Peale's duties as Chief Coiner. Taxay noted that this was only true because the retired Adam Eckfeldt was still performing the duties of that office without salary, and this ceased in February 1852 when Eckfeldt died after a brief illness. The death of his predecessor caused Peale to write "a frantic letter" to the new Mint Director (Patterson had retired), <a href="George%20N.%20Eckert">George N. Eckert</a>, stating that he urgently needed an assistant.

McCulloh's campaign had continued; on August 1, 1851, he wrote directly to President Fillmore, accusing Peale of "lavish and unnecessary expenditure of public money", and stating that Peale was unfit to hold office. He alleged that Mint workmen had been detailed to make repairs to Peale's house while being paid for their time by the government. One man subsequently stated that he and another Mint employee spent two days working on Peale's house; another alleged that whenever the archery club of which Peale was a member met, Mint employees were sent to help with the arrangements. McCulloh also accused Peale of having Mint workers make furniture for his use when they would otherwise be idle. Corwin ordered an investigation, which dragged on for the next year and a half. Peale entered a statement in April 1852, alleging that McCulloh was accusing the Director and the accounting staff of "gross neglect of duty", and that McCulloh's attack on Peale's medal business was a slight on "the late venerable and much loved Adam Eckfeldt", whose precedent Peale stated he was following. Peale wrote in his defense, "I boldly claim to have done for the Mint and my country, much that will entitle me gratitude."

Eckert was friendly towards Peale, and worked to discredit the accusations. McCulloh urged Corwin to review the correspondence himself, and the Secretary agreed, but both Corwin and Eckert left office in early 1853 with no action having been taken against Peale. McCulloh that summer published a pamphlet, "The Proceedings of the Late Director of the Mint in Relation to the Official Misconduct of Franklin Peale Esq., Chief Coiner and Other Abuses in the Mint", printing much of the correspondence. This tract was reviewed by the new Mint Director, <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a>; he and the new Treasury Secretary, <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a>, decided to forbid private enterprises on the Mint's property. In August 1854, Guthrie issued regulations banning the practice.

Taxay recorded that the new policy "seem[s] to have been ill-received in certain quarters of the Mint" but that as not all records are extant, the specifics are uncertain. According to Taxay,

The reasons for Peale's firing were not publicly announced, and his friends and allies, such as William DuBois (Adam Eckfeldt's son-in-law and the Assistant Assayer (later Assayer) of the Philadelphia Mint) stated that it was so President Pierce could have the position to fill from the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>. Taxay noted that this explanation ignored the fact that <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, under whose administration Peale had been appointed Chief Coiner, was also a Democrat as president. Nevertheless, an 1873 Senate report on Peale's request for compensation after being dismissed stated, "why such a valuable officer was displaced does not appear".

After his departure from the Philadelphia Mint, Peale initially retired from all employment. In 1864, he returned to the private sector as president of the Hazelton Coal and Rail Road Company, in which he had long been involved, remaining in that position through 1867. Civic organizations of which he was president included the Musical Fund Society of Pennsylvania and the Institution for Instruction to the Blind. He had been elected a manager of the latter organization in 1839, served on many important committees, and was elected its president in 1863, still holding the office at his death in 1870. A member of the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Society">American Philosophical Society</a> since 1833, he served as one of its curators from 1838 to 1845 and from 1847 until 1870. A longtime member of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts</a>, which his father had helped to found, he served as one of its directors through much of his retirement. He was elected a member of the <a href="American%20Antiquarian%20Society">American Antiquarian Society</a> in 1865.

In his later years, Peale spent some of his autumns at the <a href="Delaware%20Water%20Gap">Delaware Water Gap</a> north of Philadelphia, searching for <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> artifacts and amassing a major collection. Peale catalogued his finds and added narrative descriptions, bequeathing the collection to the American Philosophical Society. An adept archer, he helped found the United Bowmen club, members of whom carried his casket to his grave, at his instructions. He was also, at his death, president of the Skater's Club. He was a lifelong skater, and developed a method for extracting a skater who broke through the ice that saved many lives.

Peale was among those consulted in 1870 by Treasury Secretary <a href="George%20Boutwell">George Boutwell</a> in preparing the legislation to reform the Mint that became the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>. Peale advocated for the office of the Mint Director to be moved from Philadelphia to Washington; this was enacted. He supported the abolition of the gold dollar and the <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a>, but these coins were not ended by Congress until 1890. He denigrated recent coin issues (many designed by Longacre, who had died in 1869), saying that their designs have, "hitherto been lamentably, if not disgracefully deficient".

Peale married twice; his first marriage to Eliza Greatrake, contracted in 1815 while he was still a minor, produced one daughter, Anna, who survived him. His second, childless, marriage was to Caroline Girard Haslam, a widow, and the niece of the wealthy <a href="Stephen%20Girard">Stephen Girard</a>; it lasted from 1839 to his death. He enjoyed the company of children, making toys by his own hand for them. Peale was in declining health in his final months, but was still able to continue his activities, and only a short illness preceded his death at his home at 1131 Girard Street in Philadelphia, on May 5, 1870. His final words were, "If this is death, it is as I wished, perfect peace, perfect comfort, perfect joy."

Mint Director <a href="Henry%20Linderman">Henry Linderman</a> stated in 1873 of Peale, "Although Mr. Peale undoubtedly received the cooperation of [Patterson and others], the inventions and improvements were peculiarly Mr. Peale's. I have no doubt whatever on that point. They were of almost incalculable value to the public service." George G. Evans, in his late 19th century history of the Mint, described Peale, "his mildness, integrity, gentlemanly bearing and high moral and mental culture constituted him a model officer". <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> deemed Peale, "brilliant but unscrupulous". Burdette writes of Peale and his effect on the Mint, "during the generation from about 1830 to 1855, the greatest influence to operations and production came from one man: Benjamin Franklin Peale. He was the consummate 'machinist' of the day at a time when this term encompassed imaginative design, planning, construction and improvement of working processes ... While he had the complete support of mint directors Moore and Patterson, he was also held in high esteem by the common mint workers and Philadelphia's scientific elite. Results of many of his ideas lasted a century or more, until growth in population made nineteenth century engineering insufficient for modern coinage needs." According to Bowers, "today Peale is one of several Mint people who can be viewed from many different angles, each perspective sometimes leading certain writers to draw widely differing conclusions."

After his dismissal, Peale petitioned Congress for $30,000 as payment for improvements and inventions he had made for the government. The Senate twice, in 1858 and 1860, passed legislation to pay Peale $10,000, but the House of Representatives declined to vote on it. In 1870, it was introduced in the Senate again, but did not pass. Legislation to compensate Peale in the amount of $10,000 was enacted on March 3, 1873, after his death—the act was, according to its title, in relief of Anna E. Peale, Franklin Peale's daughter. The following month, Caroline Peale, Franklin's widow, gave the Mint a marble bust of her late husband, "to be set upon a pedestal, in some position, where it may be open to the inspection of visitors and preserve his memory to future generations." Taxay, writing in 1966, stated that he had been unable to ascertain the bust's whereabouts.

The Carpet from Bagdad

The Carpet from Bagdad is a 1915 American <a href="silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="adventure%20film">adventure film</a> directed by <a href="Colin%20Campbell%20%28director%29">Colin Campbell</a> and based on <a href="Harold%20MacGrath">Harold MacGrath</a>'s 1911 eponymous novel. In the story, Horace Wadsworth (played by <a href="Guy%20Oliver">Guy Oliver</a>), one of a gang of criminals also planning a bank robbery in New York, steals the titular <a href="prayer%20rug">prayer rug</a> from its <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> mosque. He sells the carpet to antique dealer George Jones (<a href="Wheeler%20Oakman">Wheeler Oakman</a>) to fund the robbery scheme. But the theft places both men and Fortune Chedsoye (<a href="Kathlyn%20Williams">Kathlyn Williams</a>), the innocent daughter of another conspirator, in danger from the carpet's guardian.

Marketing for the film included a media tour of part of the set and an invitation-only screening sponsored by the publisher of MacGrath's book. "The Carpet from Bagdad" was released on May 3, 1915 to mostly positive reviews. Many praised the <a href="film%20tinting%23Tinting%20in%20the%20silent%20era">tinted</a> desert scenes and realistic Middle East imagery, although some felt the scenery overshadowed the characters. The film is now mostly <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>, although one badly damaged reel was salvaged from the <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS "Lusitania"</a> in 1982.

Horace Wadsworth, disinherited brother of New York banker Arthur Wadsworth, joins a gang of international criminals. He plots to rob his brother's bank by constructing a tunnel from the nearby home of antique dealer George Jones, who is currently on a trip to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> to purchase antique rugs. Horace follows him there, and, learning of the Sacred Carpet of Bagdad, joins the caravan of its sworn guardian, Mohamed. Meanwhile, Horace's confederates Major Callahan and Mrs. Chedsoye arrive in Cairo along with Mrs. Chedsoye's daughter, Fortune, who is unaware of her mother's illicit activities.

When the criminals meet with Jones in Cairo, Jones becomes enamored of Fortune. Horace steals the Sacred Carpet from Mohamed's mosque and sells it to Jones to fund the robbery plan. Fortune, becoming suspicious of her mother and the surrounding events, steals the prayer rug from Jones and hides it in her mother's effects. Unable to locate the stolen carpet, Mohamed kidnaps Horace, Jones, and Fortune. Meanwhile, Mrs. Chedsoye and Major Callahan return to New York, where a fourth member of the conspiracy, Wallace, has acquired forged paperwork to gain access to the Jones residence.

The captives escape from Mohamed's planned torture and flee to <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. Horace immediately returns to New York to rejoin his compatriots. Fortune and Jones, who have fallen in love, also travel back to New York. Once there, Jones learns of the forgery, and returns home to confront the gang, who still have the Sacred Carpet and who have completed their tunnel into the vaults of Arthur Wadsworth's bank. Sympathetic to Horace after their shared experiences, Jones offers the robbers a two-hour lead before he notifies the police, but keeps the prayer rug. Meanwhile, Mohamed resigns himself to the loss of the carpet.


"The Carpet from Bagdad" is a <a href="film%20adaptation">film adaptation</a> of <a href="Harold%20MacGrath">Harold MacGrath</a>'s 1911 novel of the same name. MacGrath was a well-traveled, successful author of over a dozen novels. Stories with Asian settings were in vogue at the time, and both "The Carpet from Bagdad" and the <a href="Selig%20Polyscope%20Company">Selig Polyscope Company</a>'s previous adaptation of MacGrath's work, the popular serial "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Kathlyn">The Adventures of Kathlyn</a>", are set in part in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>.

Director <a href="Colin%20Campbell%20%28director%29">Colin Campbell</a> was concerned with the film's realism. He had sets constructed to represent the streets of Cairo, <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, and Damascus, and used animals from the <a href="Selig%20Zoo">Selig Zoo</a>. Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' clothing was genuine, and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was <a href="film%20tinting%23Tinting%20in%20the%20silent%20era">hand tinted</a>. Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms.

<a href="William%20Nicholas%20Selig">William Selig</a> aggressively promoted his studio and its films. One such promotion, a March 1915 media tour of the unfinished Selig Zoo, allowed reporters a visit to "The Carpet from Bagdad"'s bazaar set. This was the first film distributed by <a href="V-L-S-E">V-L-S-E</a>, a conglomerate created by <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a>, <a href="Lubin%20Manufacturing%20Company">Lubin Manufacturing Company</a>, Selig Polyscope Company, and <a href="Essanay%20Studios">Essanay Studios</a>. The film was also <a href="film%20screening">screened</a> in a special invitation-only showing at the art gallery of the <a href="Bobbs-Merrill%20Company">Bobbs-Merrill Company</a>, publisher of MacGrath's novel, an early example of a sponsored exhibition of a feature film in a location other than a theater.

"The Carpet from Bagdad" was released on May 3, 1915, to generally positive reviews. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" described it as a more interesting film than its title might imply, with "perfect direction and faultless acting". <a href="Peter%20Milne%20%28screenwriter%29">Peter Milne</a> of "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20News">Motion Picture News</a>" approved of Campbell's attention to detail and realism. "<a href="The%20Moving%20Picture%20World">The Moving Picture World</a>"'s James McQuade praised the film's acting and special effects. Although he believed an unfilmed Cairo scene made Mohamed's motivations easier to understand in the novel, he considered the film a "close second" to Campbell's 1914 "<a href="The%20Spoilers%20%281914%20film%29">The Spoilers</a>". Clarence Caine's review in "<a href="Motography">Motography</a>" also compared "The Carpet from Bagdad" favorably to "The Spoilers", but he viewed the film's color as its best feature, especially the closing scene of a desert sunset. Several newspaper reviews also complimented the tinted desert scenes, with New Zealand's "The Levin Chronicle" describing the film as "a gem of the cinematographer's art" for its use of color. The "<a href="Chicago%20Daily%20Tribune">Chicago Daily Tribune</a>" offered a more mixed opinion on the film; reviewer Kitty Kelly found it difficult to care about characters "overshadowed by environment", and considered the 35-year-old Williams unconvincing as an <a href="ingenue%20%28stock%20character%29">ingenue</a>.

Despite the acclaim from many contemporary reviewers, modern scholars of the silent film era would not consider "The Carpet from Bagdad" a masterpiece, according to the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s Clyde Jeavons.

Like many films from the silent era, "The Carpet from Bagdad" was believed completely <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>, but in 1982 an <a href="Oceaneering%20International">Oceaneering International</a> diving expedition salvaged a number of artifacts from the wreck of the <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS "Lusitania"</a>, including one reel of film. With the assistance of <a href="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="technical%20advisor">technical advisor</a> Laurie Ward, the <a href="BFI%20National%20Archive">BFI National Archive</a> was able to recover images from several feet of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on the "Lusitania", this <a href="film%20print">print</a> of "The Carpet from Bagdad" was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, as was the case for several other films known to have been on board.

William Beach Thomas

Sir William Beach Thomas, (22 May 186812 May 1957) was a British author and journalist known for his work as a <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a> and his writings about nature and country life.

Beach Thomas was the son of a rural clergyman. He attended <a href="Shrewsbury%20School">Shrewsbury School</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> before embarking on a short-lived career as a schoolmaster. Finding that work unpleasant, he turned his attention to writing articles for newspapers and periodicals, and began to write books.

During the early part of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, Beach Thomas defied military authorities to report news stories from the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> for his employer, the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>". As a result, he was briefly imprisoned before being granted official accreditation as a war correspondent. His reportage for the remainder of the war received national recognition, despite being criticised by some and parodied by soldiers. His book "With the British on the Somme" (1917) portrayed the English soldier in a very favourable light. Both France and Britain rewarded him with knighthoods after the war, but Beach Thomas regretted some of his wartime output.

Beach Thomas's primary interest as an adult was in rural matters. He was conservative in his views, and feared that the post–<a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> <a href="Attlee%20ministry">socialist governments</a> regarded the countryside only from an economic perspective. He was an advocate for the creation of <a href="National%20parks%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">national parks in England and Wales</a>, and mourned the decline of traditional village society. He wrote extensively, particularly for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" newspaper and "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>", a conservative magazine. His book "The English Landscape" (1938) includes selections from his contributions to "<a href="Country%20Life%20%28magazine%29">Country Life</a>" magazine.

William Beach Thomas was born on 22 May 1868 in <a href="Godmanchester">Godmanchester</a>, in the county of <a href="Huntingdonshire">Huntingdonshire</a>, England. He was the second son of Daniel George Thomas and his wife, Rosa Beart. In 1872, his father was appointed <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> of <a href="Hamerton">Hamerton</a> and the countryside location of that parish inspired an affection in Beach Thomas which greatly influenced his later observational writings about natural history and rural subjects. Beach Thomas was not a hyphenated <a href="double-barrelled%20name">double-barrelled name</a>; he used his second name as part of his surname.

Beach Thomas attended Shrewsbury School from 1882. He was a keen sportsman there and was appointed huntsman to the Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt, the world's oldest <a href="cross-country%20running">cross-country running</a> club. He continued his interest in sports after earning an <a href="Exhibition%20%28scholarship%29">exhibition</a> to <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a> in 1887 and became a <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a>, representing the university in various running events over several years. He became president of the Oxford University Athletics Club and played <a href="association%20football">association football</a>, <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> and <a href="cricket">cricket</a> at college level. <a href="John%20Black%20Atkins">J. B. Atkins</a>, who competed against him for the <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> athletics team, said: "With his stately height and gigantic stride, he was magnificent in action; his final effort, always, triumphant, when he saw the goal of all, the tape, waiting for him, was a sight never to be forgotten – though I had a strong reason for regretting it at the time." His exhibition was superseded by a scholarship but he was not academically successful, managing only a <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification">third-class degree</a>.

Athletic prowess and the time spent in achieving it may have contributed to Beach Thomas's poor academic performance but probably also assisted him in getting his first job. He taught at <a href="Bradfield%20College">Bradfield School</a>, a <a href="Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public school</a>, after leaving Oxford in 1891. Although he described teaching as "uncongenial", he subsequently took a similar position at <a href="Dulwich%20College">Dulwich College</a> in 1897, where he remained until the following year. Journalism became the object of his interest; he contributed columns for "<a href="The%20Globe%20%28London%20newspaper%29">The Globe</a>", "<a href="The%20Outlook%20%28British%20magazine%29">The Outlook</a>" and "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">The Saturday Review</a>", as well as for many other publications of which he was not a member of staff. He also wrote a book entitled "Athletics", published by <a href="Ward%20Lock%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Ward Lock & Co</a> in 1901, following his 1900 contribution of a chapter titled "Athletics and Schools" to the "Athletics" volume in the <a href="Badminton%20Library">Badminton Library</a> series, published by <a href="Longmans">Longman, Green & Co</a> and edited by <a href="Montague%20Shearman">Montague Shearman</a>. He became a regular reviewer for "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>" from its formation in 1902.

The "Daily Mail" took on Beach Thomas as a writer of material relating to the countryside. <a href="Alfred%20Harmsworth%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Northcliffe">Lord Northcliffe</a>, who owned the newspaper, recognised that Beach Thomas would need to live in a rural environment if he was to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Beach Thomas because it meant he could limit his visits to London. He moved to the <a href="Mimram">Mimram Valley</a> in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard.

Beach Thomas's "From a Hertfordshire Cottage" was published in 1908, followed by a three-volume collaboration with <a href="Anthony%20Collett">A. K. Collett</a>, "The English Year" (1913–14). He did not entirely abandon his interest in athletics and was one of those in Britain who criticised his country's poor performance in the <a href="1912%20Olympic%20Games">1912 Olympic Games</a>. Writing that the Olympics were by then being seen as a measure of "national vitality", he explained 

The "Daily Mail" sent Beach Thomas to France as a <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a> during the First World War. Many newspapers were keen to support the war effort and to take advantage of the demand for news from the <a href="Front%20%28military%29">front</a>. The British military authorities were opposed to the presence of journalists, preferring instead to control the media by issuing official press releases. <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> in particular was opposed to their presence, having had bad experiences of journalists during the <a href="Boer%20War">Boer War</a>. He formed a press bureau headed by , and demanded that all reports be channelled through the bureau for review by censors; the resulting output was bland and impersonal. The newspapers countered with subterfuge. Beach Thomas was one of several journalists who managed to reach the front lines in Belgium. He was discovered there and imprisoned for some time by the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>. He described the episode as "the longest walking tour of my life, and the queerest". Even these early unapproved reports, which consisted mostly of <a href="Human%20interest%20story">human interest stories</a> because there was little opportunity for contact with the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a>, were censored at home owing to a paradox that Beach Thomas described: "the censors would not publish any article if it indicated that the writer had seen what he wrote of. He must write what he thought was true, not what he knew to be true."

When the British government relented in mid-1915, having been warned by <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> that the reporting limitations were affecting public opinion in the United States, <a href="Valentine%20Williams">Valentine Williams</a> became the "Daily Mail's" first accredited war correspondent. No longer in prison, Beach Thomas resumed his war reporting in December of the same year, when Williams enlisted in the <a href="Irish%20Guards">Irish Guards</a>. As with the other accredited journalists, he was paid by the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> rather than by his newspaper and they were all assured that they would be able to publish memoirs of their service to offset the differential between an officer's pay and that of a journalist. Beach Thomas filed reports from places such as <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">the Somme</a> in a format matching that of his colleagues, who regularly downplayed the unpleasant aspects of the conflict such as the nature of death. His reports were published in the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" as well as the "Daily Mail".

The soldiers derided the attempts that were made to indoctrinate them, but the British public was more susceptible. <a href="Philip%20Gibbs">Philip Gibbs</a>, a fellow war correspondent, noted that he and his colleagues "identified absolutely with the Armies in the field ... There was no need of censorship in our despatches. We were our own censors." The journalistic support for the cause was appreciated by military commanders such as <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Douglas Haig</a>, who saw the propaganda generated by the correspondents as an integral part of the Allies' efforts. Haig eventually went so far as to ask Gibbs and Beach Thomas to produce his own weekly news-sheet. Public opinion at home may have been mollified, even uplifted, by the efforts of the correspondents but the troops were not, despite the high demand among them for newspapers from home. One soldier, Albert Rochester, was <a href="court%20martial">court martial</a>led for attempting to send to the "Daily Mail" a letter that stated the realities as he saw them and was critical of Beach Thomas's work, noting the "ridiculous reports regarding the love and fellowship existing between officers and men". Beach Thomas himself later regretted his wartime reports of the Somme, saying, "I was thoroughly and deeply ashamed of what I had written for the good reason that it was untrue ... the vulgarity of enormous headlines and the enormity of one's own name did not lessen the shame."

Northcliffe's brother, <a href="Harold%20Harmsworth%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Rothermere">Lord Rothermere</a>, expressed frustration with the war correspondents: "They don't know the truth, they don't speak the truth, and we know that they don't." Stephen Badsey, a historian who specialises in World War I, has noted that their situation was not easy as they "found themselves as minor players trapped in a complicated hierarchical structure dominated by politicians, generals and newspaper owners". Beach Thomas received particular opprobrium. <a href="Paul%20Fussell">Paul Fussell</a>, the historian, describes him as "notoriously fatuous" during the war period. <a href="Peter%20Stothard">Peter Stothard</a>, editor of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" between 1992 and 2002, describes him as "a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous "Daily Mail" war correspondent" and believes that he may have been the inspiration for the character of <a href="William%20Boot">William Boot</a> in <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>'s "<a href="Scoop%20%28novel%29">Scoop</a>". <a href="John%20Simpson%20%28journalist%29">John Simpson</a>, a war correspondent, describes him as "charming but unlovable" and thinks that the troops despised Beach Thomas more than they did the other British war correspondents, even though all those journalists were playing a similar disinformation role. They considered his writing to be a trivialisation of the realities of war, jingoistic, pompous and particularly self-promoting, often giving the reader an impression that he was writing from the battlefield when in fact he was being fed information of dubious value by the authorities while based in their headquarters.

An example of his reporting is as follows:
His style was parodied using the by-line of "Teech Bomas" in the "<a href="Wipers%20Times">Wipers Times</a>", a trench newspaper, but he was lauded by the readership back in Britain. One example from the "Wipers Times", based on a report published in the "Daily Mail" of 18 September 1916, was:

Beach Thomas published a book based on his wartime experiences in 1917, entitled "With the British on the Somme". It was a favourable depiction specifically of the English soldier, somewhat contrary to the official line that tried to emphasise that this was a British war rather than an English one. A review in "The Times Literary Supplement" noted that Beach Thomas
In 1918, Northcliffe asked Beach Thomas to travel to the US. According to Beach Thomas, the rationale was that "he didn't know what the Americans were doing, and they did not know what we were thinking". He met with influential people such as <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>, Roosevelt and <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> during this visit.

Beach Thomas sometimes accompanied <a href="George%20V">George V</a> and the <a href="Edward%20VIII">Prince of Wales</a> on their visits to France, noting on one occasion a situation he considered reminiscent of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>:
Beach Thomas's war work led to state recognition, as it did for many of the correspondents and newspaper owners; France appointed him a <a href="Chevalier%20of%20the%20Legion%20of%20Honour">Chevalier of the Legion of Honour</a> in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE award, which he too received: "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it so much that I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency." This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.

After the war, Beach Thomas stayed in Germany until 1919 and returned there in 1923 at the time of the <a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Ruhr">Occupation of the Ruhr</a>. He also undertook a tour of the world for the "Daily Mail" and "The Times" in 1922. His main focus returned to his lifelong interest in matters of the countryside, notably in his writings for "The Observer" from 1923 to 1956. Beach Thomas was also a regular contributor of notes on nature, gardening and country life to "The Spectator" for almost 30 years, with some short breaks between 1935 and 1941, when <a href="H.%20E.%20Bates">H. E. Bates</a> took responsibility. In 1928 he produced a history of the magazine under the title of "The Story of the 'Spectator", in commemoration of its centenary. He wrote many more books and articles in his later years, as well as two autobiographical books: "A Traveller in News" (1925) and "The Way of a Countryman" (1944). Fond of peppering quotations throughout his writing, his style was considered to be clear but his hand was poor; a profile of him in "The Observer" said "perhaps he gave less pleasure to those who had to decipher his handwriting. Rarely has more limpid English been conveyed in a script more obscure."

<a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> wrote in the "<a href="Manchester%20Evening%20News">Manchester Evening News</a>":

Even as traditional English village living was in collapse, he saw the romanticised paternalism and general life of the village as the epitome of English society and equivalent to anything that might be found elsewhere in the world. He said that one of the aspects of village life he admired was that "comparative wealth [there] is admired, not envied". He also viewed the natural world as something to be wondered at rather than scientifically examined. In his last column for "The Spectator", written in September 1950, he wrote:
In his desire to encourage a love of the countryside, especially during the Second World War, Beach Thomas was similar to other writers on rural matters, such as <a href="G.%20M.%20Trevelyan">G. M. Trevelyan</a> and <a href="H.%20J.%20Massingham">H. J. Massingham</a>. He described Massingham as "perhaps the best of all present writers on Rural England" and considered him among those writers who were "so fond of the past that they seem sometimes almost to despair of the future". Malcolm Chase, a historian, says that these authors, including Beach Thomas himself, advocated an ultra-conservative, socially reactionary and idealistic philosophy that formed an important part of a national debate about the future of the land and agriculture. This attitude was coupled with an increasing public interest in pastimes such as cycling, motoring and walking; it was supported by the publication of popular, fairly cheap and colourful articles, books and maps that catered both to those pursuing such interests and those who were concerned about conservation and the effects of the influx of urban and suburban visitors. John Musty, in his comparative literary review of the works of Beach Thomas and Massingham, believes that Beach Thomas had a more "gentle touch" than Massingham, whose writings have "frequently been judged as narrow and reactionary"; he quotes Beach Thomas as saying of the likes of Massingham that they "preach an impossible creed, albeit an attractive one".

Much of one book, "The English Landscape" (1938), had previously appeared in various issues of "Country Life" magazine, and in part echoed concerns raised by <a href="Clough%20Williams-Ellis">Clough Williams-Ellis</a> in works such as "England and the Octopus" (1928). Williams-Ellis believed that building on <a href="greenfield%20land">greenfield land</a> was too great a price to pay for socio-economic progress. Beach Thomas argued in favour of protecting open spaces by creating national parks, for which he thought that the coastline would be the most suitable candidate. He stressed the relationship between the people and the land and saw a need for planning control to manage human ingress into areas that remained mostly untouched. In 1934 he supported the Nature Lovers Association in their appeal to make the mountainous <a href="Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a> region, near the coast of <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a>, such an entity. He also supported the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society.

In 1931 Beach Thomas lamented the inability of the <a href="National%20Farmers%20Union%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">National Farmers Union of England and Wales</a> to arrest what he saw as the decline of the farming industry. In "A Countryman's Creed" (1946) he harked back to a lost world, perhaps even a world that was more of his imagination than it ever was fact. As <a href="F.%20R.%20Leavis">F. R. Leavis</a> had done before him, Beach Thomas sought a rural revival to curtail what he perceived to be the rapid changes to traditional modes of living that had been evident in particular in the aftermath of the First World War and which were now ideologically challenged following the substantial victory of the socialist <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 general election</a>. The new government was a threat to Beach Thomas's view of the world because, in the words of literary critic Robert Hemmings, it saw the countryside "as merely a giant dairy and granary for the city".

Beach Thomas was opposed to the use of the <a href="Animal%20trapping">toothed steel trap</a> for catching rabbits, supporting the <a href="RSPCA">RSPCA</a> in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it both inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.

Beach Thomas married Helen Dorothea Harcourt, a daughter of <a href="Augustus%20George%20Vernon%20Harcourt">Augustus George Vernon Harcourt</a>, in April 1900, and with her had three sons and a daughter. Their second son, Michael Beach Thomas, was killed in 1941 while serving as a naval officer during the Second World War. Helen survived her husband, who died on 12 May 1957 at their home, "High Trees", <a href="Gustardwood%20common">Gustardwood</a>, <a href="Wheathampstead">Wheathampstead</a>, Hertfordshire. He was buried in the village churchyard at <a href="St%20Helen%27s%20Church%2C%20Wheathampstead">St Helen's Church</a>. Among the obituaries to Beach Thomas were those published in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" and "The Times".

Aside from his journalism, Beach Thomas wrote and contributed to many books, all published in London and some also in places such as New York. These include:

Nine Stones, Winterbourne Abbas

The Nine Stones, also known as the Devil's Nine Stones, the Nine Ladies, or Lady Williams and her Dog, is a <a href="stone%20circles%20in%20the%20British%20Isles%20and%20Brittany">stone circle</a> located near to the village of <a href="Winterbourne%20Abbas">Winterbourne Abbas</a> in the <a href="Southwest%20England">southwestern</a> <a href="England">English</a> county of <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. <a href="Archaeology">Archaeologists</a> believe that it was likely erected during the <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Bronze Age</a>.

The Nine Stones is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread through much of Great Britain, Ireland, and Brittany between 3,300 and 900 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>, during the <a href="Neolithic%20British%20Isles">Late Neolithic</a> and Early Bronze Age. The stone circle tradition was accompanied by the construction of timber circles and earthen <a href="henge">henge</a>s, reflecting a growing emphasis on circular monuments. The purpose of such rings is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> entities for the circle's builders. At least nine of these stone circles are known to have been constructed near modern Dorset. They are smaller than those found elsewhere in Great Britain and are typically built from <a href="sarsen">sarsen</a> stone.

Located in the bottom of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a diameter of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen <a href="megalith">megalith</a>s, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the northwestern side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in southwestern Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.

<a href="Antiquarianism">Antiquarians</a> like <a href="John%20Aubrey">John Aubrey</a> and <a href="William%20Stukeley">William Stukeley</a> first took an interest in the site during the eighteenth century. It later received archaeological attention, although it has not been <a href="excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavated</a>. Local <a href="folklore">folklore</a> has grown up around the circle, associating it with <a href="the%20Devil">the Devil</a> and with children petrified into rock. The Nine Stones are regarded as a <a href="sacred%20site">sacred site</a> by local <a href="Neo-Druidism">Druids</a>, who perform religious ceremonies there. The circle is adjacent to the <a href="A35%20road">A35 road</a> and encircled by trees. The site is owned by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> and is open without charge to visitors.

The Nine Stones circle is positioned at the <a href="Ordnance%20Survey%20National%20Grid">national grid reference</a> 36100904, on the western edge of the village of <a href="Winterbourne%20Abbas">Winterbourne Abbas</a> in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, <a href="Southwest%20England">Southwest England</a> . Enclosed within iron railings, it is surrounded on three sides by trees and on the northern side by the <a href="A35%20road">A35 road</a>. The roots of a <a href="beech%20tree">beech tree</a> have engulfed two of the megaliths in the circle.
The archaeologist <a href="Aubrey%20Burl">Aubrey Burl</a> noted that while "this petite ring should be a delight to see", it was instead a "frustration" as a result of its restricted location. He noted that it was difficult to take clear photographs of the site because of the surrounding trees.

While the transition from the <a href="Neolithic">Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic</a>—which took place with the transition from the fourth to the third millennium BCE—witnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3,000 BCE, the <a href="long%20barrow">long barrow</a>s, <a href="causewayed%20enclosure">causewayed enclosure</a>s, and <a href="cursus">cursus</a>es which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen <a href="henge">henge</a>s, <a href="timber%20circles">timber circles</a>, and stone circles. These stone rings are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's southeastern corner. Stone circles are most densely concentrated in southwestern Britain and on the northeastern horn of Scotland, near <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, with the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE.

These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, and may have been deliberately created to serve as what the historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> describes as "silent and empty monuments". The archaeologist <a href="Mike%20Parker%20Pearson">Mike Parker Pearson</a> suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.

Burl described modern Dorset as having a "thin scatter" of stone circles, with nine possible examples known within the county's boundaries. The archaeologist John Gale described these as "a small but significant group" of such monuments, and all are located within five miles of the sea. All but one—<a href="Rempstone%20Stone%20Circle">Rempstone Stone Circle</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Purbeck">Isle of Purbeck</a>—are located on the chalk hills west of <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a>. The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology and are of a comparatively small size in comparison to other British stone circles, with none exceeding 28 metres (92 feet) in diameter. All are oval in shape, although they perhaps have been altered from their original form. With the exception of the Rempstone circle, all consist of <a href="sarsen">sarsen</a> stone. Much of this may have been obtained from the <a href="Littlebredy%23Valley%20of%20Stones">Valley of Stones</a>, a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to <a href="Littlebredy">Littlebredy</a>, which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles. With the exception of the circle at <a href="Litton%20Cheney">Litton Cheney</a>, none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle.

The archaeologists <a href="Stuart%20Piggott">Stuart</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Guido">Cecily Piggott</a> believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin, a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites. It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date, and the Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that "their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age".
Their nearest analogies are the circles found on <a href="Dartmoor">Dartmoor</a> and <a href="Exmoor">Exmoor</a> to the west, and the <a href="Stanton%20Drew%20stone%20circles">Stanton Drew stone circles</a> to the north. It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.

The Nine Stones circle has been described by Gale as "probably the most well documented of all those surviving in the county". It measures 9.1 metres by 7.9 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches) in diameter, as measured from a north-to-south direction. The stones are of sarsen or <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a>. A gap between two stones on the side of the circle adjacent to the road may suggest that there was once a tenth stone in the monument. Given its dimensions, the circle could only accommodate a small number of individuals assembling within it.

Seven of the nine surviving stones are under 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, but two of the northwestern stones are considerably larger. Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest of the stones weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and would have required the efforts of many people to move and erect it.

This disparity between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, and may have been a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in southwestern Scotland, for example the <a href="Loupin%20Stanes">Loupin' Stones</a>, <a href="Ninestane%20Rig">Ninestane Rig</a>, and <a href="Burgh%20Hill">Burgh Hill</a>, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and southwestern Scotland is the fact that the <a href="The%20Grey%20Mare%20and%20her%20Colts">Grey Mare and her Colts</a>—a <a href="chambered%20long%20barrow">chambered long barrow</a> located two and a half miles southwest of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.

The circle is located at the bottom of a narrow valley. Though this is unusual for a monument of this type, the Dorset Rempstone stone circle was also erected within a valley.

The antiquarian <a href="John%20Aubrey">John Aubrey</a> recorded a further stone circle, located about a kilometre (half a mile) to the west of the Nine Stones, which was of similar dimensions to it. It was later destroyed, although as of the 1930s three stones were recorded as remaining at the site. Gale later suggested that this site may not have even been a stone circle at all, but might instead have been the remains of an Early Neolithic chambered tomb. He noted, however, that "as nothing remains it is at the moment impossible to resolve".

There is also a fallen <a href="standing%20stone">standing stone</a> known as the Broad Stone which measures 2 metres (6.6 feet) in length and which lies beside the road about 1.5 kilometres (0.9 miles) to the west of the Nine Stones. As it was recorded in the nineteenth century it measured 3 metres (10 feet) in length, 2 metres (6 and a half feet) in breadth, and 0.6 metres (2 feet) in thickness. The monument was protected from passing cars by several bollards which were later removed by the highways authority, prompting statements of concern that the stone was unprotected in 2008.

The circle was recorded by Aubrey in the seventeenth century, and then by <a href="William%20Stukeley">William Stukeley</a> in the eighteenth century. Aubrey recorded the presence of nine megaliths at the site, as did Stukeley's 1723 drawing of it. In the nineteenth century the site was visited by the antiquarian <a href="Charles%20Warne">Charles Warne</a>, who wrote about it in his 1872 book "Ancient Dorset". He claimed that he could discern the existence of a tenth stone, although on visiting the site in 1936, the Piggotts noted that they could find no evidence of this. Gale later stated that this claim "has never been substantiated". Warne had consulted Aubrey's manuscript, but confused Aubrey's illustration of the <a href="Devil%27s%20Quoits">Devil's Quoits</a> at <a href="Stanton%20Harcourt">Stanton Harcourt</a>, <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, for a monument that he believed had once been located near to the Nine Stones.

In 1888, the local council decreed that—along with the Grey Mare and her Colts and the Tenant Hill stone circle—the site would be registered as an "ancient monument" under the <a href="Ancient%20Monuments%20Protection%20Act%201882">Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882</a>. In August 1916, the site was then listed as a scheduled monument. The circle was included in the archaeologist <a href="O.%20G.%20S.%20Crawford">O. G. S. Crawford</a>'s "Map of Neolithic Wessex", printed by the <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> in 1932. As of 2003, the site had not been <a href="excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavated</a>.

In 1908, the stone circle was known as the "Nine Ladies" and the "Devil's Nine Stones", and in 1941 they were associated with both <a href="the%20Devil">the Devil</a> and <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> in local folklore. As of 1968, the stone circle was still known as the "Devil's Nine Stones". In 1966, a man from <a href="Winterborne%20St%20Martin">Winterborne St Martin</a> claimed that the stones were the Devil, his wife, and his children. There are many ancient sites across Britain with names that associate them with the Devil. Examining such place-names, the folklorist <a href="Jeremy%20Harte">Jeremy Harte</a> argued that they did not develop during the <a href="Christianisation%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Christianisation of England</a> in the early Middle Ages, but rather they were applied to such sites in later centuries, often supplanting the name of an earlier folkloric or legendary figure.

In 1965 a woman from the <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Isle of Portland</a> stated that her own father had always raised his cap when passing the circle. At the same time local folklore was recorded as holding that the stones in the ring could not be counted. This "<a href="countless%20stones">countless stones</a>" motif is not unique to this particular site, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early sixteenth-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early seventeenth-century document it was being applied to <a href="The%20Hurlers%20%28stone%20circles%29">The Hurlers</a>, a set of three stone circles in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an <a href="animism">animistic</a> understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.

The archaeologist <a href="Leslie%20Grinsell">Leslie Grinsell</a> reported that in the mid-1970s, he learned of a folk tale that the stones had once been children who were turned to stones as punishment for playing <a href="Knucklebones">Five-Stones</a> on a Sunday. This folk motif of humans turned to stone for revelling on a Sunday had been attached to a range of prehistoric monuments across southwestern Britain by the early eighteenth century, although it had been first recorded in Cornwall in 1602. It is likely connected to <a href="Sabbatarianism">Sabbatarianism</a>, and may have been spread by <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> preachers.

In 1984, Harte talked to various individuals who lived in the local area, finding that the monument was also known as "Lady Williams and her Dog" or "Lady Williams and her Little Dog Fido", a reference to a family who lived at Bridehead House, <a href="Littlebredy">Littlebredy</a>. He also related a story that on 23 January 1985, a <a href="Tow%20truck">breakdown van</a> was towing a car past the Nine Stones when, at 9:15pm, its engine cut out and the lights on both vehicles failed. Press coverage speculated that the event was linked to both a <a href="ley%20line">ley line</a> passing through the site and to <a href="unidentified%20flying%20objects">unidentified flying objects</a> that have been reported above the nearby <a href="Eggardon%20Hill">Eggardon Hill</a>.

The site is in the care of <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>, and can be visited at any time. The circle is considered a place of religious importance to a <a href="Druidry%20%28modern%29">modern Druidic</a> group called the Dolmen Grove Druids. They have described having to confront individuals shouting abuse at them while they have performed their rituals at the stone circle.

In October 2007, the sides of the stones facing the road were daubed in white paint with the slogans "Read family court hell" and "F4J". "F4J" was also painted on to the side of Dorset's <a href="Hardy%20Monument">Hardy Monument</a>. The activist group <a href="Fathers4Justice">Fathers4Justice</a>—whose acronym is "F4J"—denied any responsibility, condemned the action, and suggested that the slogans had been painted on by unknown individuals in an attempt to discredit the group. Concern about the vandalism was expressed by the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>, the local landowner, and the Dolmen Grove Druids.

How Brown Saw the Baseball Game

How Brown Saw the Baseball Game, also known as How Jones Saw the Baseball Game, is an American <a href="Short%20film">short</a> <a href="Silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="comedy%20film">comedy film</a> produced in 1907 and distributed by the <a href="Lubin%20Manufacturing%20Company">Lubin Manufacturing Company</a>. The film follows a baseball fan, named Mr. Brown, who drinks large quantities of alcohol before a baseball game and becomes so intoxicated that the game appears to him in reverse motion. During production, <a href="trick%20photography">trick photography</a> was used to achieve this effect.

The film was released in November 1907. It received positive reviews in a 1908 issue of "<a href="The%20Moving%20Picture%20World">The Moving Picture World</a>", a film journal, that reported the film was successful and "truly funny." it is unclear whether a print of the film has survived. The identities of the film's cast and production crew are not known. Film historians have noted similarities between the plot of "How Brown Saw the Baseball Game" and the <a href="Edwin%20S.%20Porter">Edwin S. Porter</a>-directed comedy film "How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game" released the previous year.

Before heading out to a <a href="Baseball">baseball game</a> at a nearby <a href="Baseball%20park">ballpark</a>, <a href="Fan%20%28person%29%23Types%23Sports">sports fan</a> Mr. Brown drinks several <a href="highball">highball</a> <a href="Mixed%20drink">cocktails</a>. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so <a href="Alcohol%20intoxication">inebriated</a> that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home by one of his friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.

"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game" was <a href="Filmmaking">produced</a> by <a href="Lubin%20Manufacturing%20Company">Lubin Manufacturing Company</a>, a company founded by <a href="German%20American">German-American</a> film pioneer <a href="Siegmund%20Lubin">Siegmund Lubin</a>. At the time "How Brown Saw the Baseball Game" was made, the company was creating and <a href="Film%20distribution">distributing</a> up to three films a week. The identities of "How Brown Saw the Baseball Game"s director and cast are not known.

It is a <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> shot in <a href="black%20and%20white">black and white</a>, and the finished product comprised of film. For the scenes which took place at the ballpark, the filmmakers used a form of <a href="trick%20photography">trick photography</a> in order to show the baseball players running backwards. Siegmund Lubin filed a copyright for the film, under the alternate title "How Jones Saw the Baseball Game", on October 26, 1907.

"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game" was released into theaters by Lubin Manufacturing Company on November 16, 1907, and was still being shown as late as August 1908. During this time, the film sometimes was presented as part of a <a href="double%20feature">double feature</a> with the 1907 film "Neighbors Who Borrow", a short comedy film about a man who lends nearly everything he owns to his neighbors until his wife returns home and berates him for doing so.

Advertisements for the film touted it as "such fun", and Lubin himself promoted the film as a "screamingly funny farce". It received a positive review in the June 1908 issue of "<a href="The%20Moving%20Picture%20World">The Moving Picture World</a>" which described the film as "truly funny" and that it proved to be "a veritable success".

Modern writings have often suggested that "How Brown Saw the Baseball Game" was produced as Lubin Manufacturing Company's alternative to the <a href="Edwin%20S.%20Porter">Edwin S. Porter</a>-directed comedy "How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game", a film released by <a href="Edison%20Studios">Edison Studios</a> in 1906 about an office employee sneaking out of his workplace to watch a baseball game only to discover his employer in a nearby seat. Lubin Manufacturing Company was known for creating films similar to competing motion pictures made by other studios. Lubin had previously created films resembling Edison Studios' releases "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin%20%28film%20adaptations%29">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>" and "<a href="The%20Great%20Train%20Robbery%20%281903%20film%29">The Great Train Robbery</a>".

Author Jack Spears wrote in his book "Hollywood: The Golden Era" that "How Brown Saw the Baseball Game" and "How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game" "used practically the same plot"; Rob Elderman's article "The Baseball Film: to 1920" in the journal "Base Ball" likewise notes the similarities of their plotlines.

Clackline Bridge

Clackline Bridge is a road bridge in <a href="Clackline%2C%20Western%20Australia">Clackline, Western Australia</a>, east of <a href="Perth">Perth</a> in the <a href="Shire%20of%20Northam">Shire of Northam</a>, that carried the <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Highway">Great Eastern Highway</a> until 2008. It is the only bridge in Western Australia to have spanned both a waterway and railway, the <a href="Clackline%20Brook">Clackline Brook</a> and the former <a href="Eastern%20Railway%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Eastern Railway</a> alignment. The mainly <a href="timber%20bridge">timber bridge</a> has a unique curved and sloped design, due to the difficult topography and the route of the former railway. The bridge was designed in 1934 to replace two dangerous rail crossings and a rudimentary water crossing. Construction began in January 1935, and was completed relatively quickly, with the opening ceremony held in August 1935. The bridge has undergone various improvement and maintenance works since then, including widening by in 1959–60, but remained a safety hazard, with increasing severity and numbers of accidents through the 1970s and 1980s. Planning for a highway bypass of Clackline and the Clackline Bridge began in the 1990s, and it was constructed between January 2007 and February 2008. The local community had been concerned that the historic bridge would be lost, but it remains in use as part of the local road network, and has been listed on both the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory and the <a href="Heritage%20Council%20of%20Western%20Australia">Heritage Council of Western Australia</a>'s Register of Heritage Places.

Clackline Bridge is a timber bridge spanning the <a href="Clackline%20Brook">Clackline Brook</a> and the former <a href="Eastern%20Railway%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Eastern Railway</a> alignment, in the <a href="Shire%20of%20Northam">Shire of Northam</a>, east of <a href="Perth">Perth</a>. Constrained by the topography of the site, the route of the Eastern Railway tracks, and the previous alignment of <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Highway">Great Eastern Highway</a>, the bridge has a unique curved and sloping design. It has 18 spans over a length, with a 1 in 20 <a href="Grade%20%28slope%29">slope</a> and a horizontal curve radius of . There are 18 numbered <a href="pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a>, starting from pier 1 at the eastern end. The double tracks of the Eastern Railway, which linked Perth and <a href="Northam%2C%20Western%20Australia">Northam</a> until its removal in 1981, passed between piers 16 and 17. Piers 14 to 17 are parallel to that former railway, at an angle of approximately 40 degrees to the bridge. This resulted in spans of various lengths: heading out from the western abutment, then a span between piers 16 and 17, followed by a length, two spans, and 13 spans of .
The bridge has undergone multiple alterations, but the original piers remain. They were constructed as "four rounded braced <a href="wandoo">wandoo</a> piles supported from horizontal 450mm timber sills, adzed to 400mm, fixed to concrete footings", with the footings designed to bear on foundation rocks beneath the surface. The bridge's original spans were made up of seven rounded timber <a href="Eucalyptus%20wandoo">wandoo</a> stringers, of at least diameter, bearing on <a href="jarrah">jarrah</a> corbels, supported by jarrah half caps in size. The span over the railway alignment was originally supported on four steel beams, weighing each.

Various aspects of Clackline Bridge have since been modified. Originally wide, with a footpath, the bridge was widened by , with two additional piles installed at each pier. At the same time the railway span was strengthened, with eight additional steel beams installed, and steel plates welded to the flanges of the existing girders. The approaches to the bridge were also widened, over a length of to the west, and to the east. The timber decking was upgraded to a concrete slab that has been repaired a number of times, especially around pier 13. Some of the connecting bolts in the structure have been replaced, and a concrete approach slab was installed at the western end. In 2008, the bridge was assessed as being in a well-maintained condition.

<a href="Main%20Roads%20Western%20Australia">Main Roads Western Australia</a> identifies Clackline Bridge as Structure Number 0608. , the bridge dimensions are recorded as in length and in width, with a distance of between kerbs, a deck area of , and maximum span length of . , it is the only bridge in Western Australia to have crossed both a railway line and a waterway.

The settlement of Clackline began as a stopping point on the <a href="Spencers%20Brook%2C%20Western%20Australia">Spencers Brook</a> to Northam section of the Eastern Railway line, which opened on 13 October 1886. It was also the point where the road to Newcastle (now <a href="Toodyay%2C%20Western%20Australia">Toodyay</a>) departed the Perth to <a href="Kalgoorlie%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kalgoorlie</a> road. Both the road and railway crossed the adjacent Clackline Brook. In 1926, the newly formed Main Roads Department's Engineer for Roads and Bridges, A. Fotheringham, described the majority of the <a href="Wooroloo%2C%20Western%20Australia">Wooroloo</a> to Clackline road as "simply a bush track widened out from time to time by the traffic". The road crossed the railway line twice, and Clackline Brook via a small <a href="log%20bridge">bedlog bridge</a>, in the vicinity of the town, but the rail crossings were "awkwardly and dangerously situated in regard to road traffic, owing to limited visibility", and the water crossing was described in 1935 as "a primitive and inadequate culvert".
Though the need to improve this section of road was recognised in 1926, funding was limited. Only part of the required improvement work was undertaken, and included rerouting the highway along Lockyer Road, resuming several town lots, and resurfacing the road, at a cost of ₤8000. In March 1934, torrential rain caused widespread flooding in the <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a>, affecting Northam, Toodyay, York, Beverley, and surrounding areas. Rail services were disrupted, and main roads were cut off at many points, including at Clackline. Some cars managed to bypass the flooded road by driving along the railway line, but such practice was described by the <a href="Royal%20Automobile%20Club%20of%20Western%20Australia">Royal Automobile Club</a> as "highly dangerous" and "against the railway regulations". The Main Roads Department had been considering completing the remaining improvements in November 1933, but the flooding made the situation more urgent. It prompted <a href="Albert%20Hawke">Albert Hawke</a>, <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly">MLA</a> for <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Northam">Northam</a>, to write to the Commissioner for Main Roads, E. W. Tindale, urging that the Clackline works commence, especially since works at nearby Northam had almost been finished.

Main Roads engineer Ernest Godfrey completed a design for the Clackline Deviation, a single bridge over the waterway and railway, in August 1934. Godfrey was the first bridge engineer for Main Roads, and is credited with introducing concrete and steel bridges into Western Australia; however, for Clackline Bridge, he proposed using timber – the standard material for the preceding hundred years – with steel construction only for the longer span over the railway. He also suggested that a footpath be included on the bridge, so that schoolchildren and other pedestrians would have a safer railway crossing. The cost was estimated at ₤8500, plus an additional ₤700 for the footpath. The initial design was moved south, to satisfy the Railways Department's requirement that the route not be too close to the Toodyay railway line (a spur line off the Eastern Railway) that ran parallel to the highway. This shift increased the curve radius, but required "the destruction of some well developed pine trees inside the old boundary fence of the [Clackline School] playground".

Construction was undertaken by Main Roads Department <a href="Day%20labor">day labourers</a>, starting in January 1935, as part of an unemployment relief works program. The <a href="Western%20Australian%20Government%20Railways">Western Australian Government Railways</a> (WAGR) was involved in various aspects of the project – some railway land acquisition was required, and WAGR supplied and supervised a five-ton crane, used to erect the railway span girders. The bridge was completed less than one year after construction began, which would later be described as "a considerable achievement of the management and workforce for such a complex structure". Clackline Bridge was opened on 30 August 1935 by Acting Minister for Works H. Millington, having cost £9000. The first vehicle to cross the bridge was Millington's car, carrying himself and Albert Hawke on the front bumper, and a small boy who decided to take a ride on the rear bumper. Afterwards, there was an official lunchtime party in Northam, hosted by the <a href="Northam%20Road%20Board">Northam Roads Board</a>.

Within two decades the bridge was considered a safety hazard, due to increased traffic volume, speed, and truck sizes. The primary concerns were deficiency in the width and curve radius. The bridge was strengthened as well as widened in 1959–60. Removing the footpath and using that space for the road had been suggested, but instead the structure itself was widened by , leaving the footpath intact. The approaches to the bridges were widened, new piers were erected either side of the railway span, and eight new girders were installed – six of which were part of the previous <a href="The%20Causeway">Causeway</a> structure. The work was undertaken from a suspended platform, which had to be quickly pulled up when trains went past. The widening, designed by Main Road's second bridge engineer Gilbert Marsh, cost approximately ₤20,000.

Clackline Bridge continued to be a safety concern, with several accidents occurring in the 1970s. The narrow road and small curve radius were considered major factors in the accidents, and there was roughness in the <a href="road%20surface">road surface</a> between the original and widened sections. A reinforced concrete overlay was installed on the bridge in 1978, initially with a <a href="chipseal">single coat surface</a>, but then upgraded to a <a href="bituminous%20concrete">bituminous concrete</a> surface in 1987. The 1980s saw the closure and removal of the Perth–Northam railway line, as well a number of major and sometimes fatal accidents involving <a href="Semi-trailer%20truck">prime movers</a>. There were also several car accidents, and the "screaming brakes of cars and hiss of airbrakes" were often heard at night in Clackline. After each accident, damaged sections of the bridge – usually the guardrails, handrails, or bridge entry section – needed to be repaired. A 1989 prime mover accident severely damaged the footpath. Rather than repair the narrow footpath, and given that the railway had been removed, a new pedestrian path was constructed on the ground below the bridge.

A bushfire burnt through the area in December 1993, destroying the former railway's bridge over Clackline Brook. Clackline Bridge survived, weakened but in a reasonable condition. The damage included internal expansion joints that had failed, split bedlogs, and other deteriorated timbers. Steel props were installed to support the bridge, and the substructure was repaired in 1995, which mainly involved replacing connecting bolts. A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western abutment in 1998, and in 2013 the concrete deck near pier 13 was repaired. Clackline Bridge was the crossing point for Great Eastern Highway until the highway's bypass of Clackline opened in February 2008. The bridge remains open to traffic, as part of the local road network. In July 2012 it once more carried highway traffic, excluding <a href="heavy%20vehicle">heavy vehicle</a>s, when an accident temporarily closed Great Eastern Highway at Spencers Brook Road.

In the wake of the accidents of the 1970s and 1980s, replacement of Clackline Bridge seemed inevitable; however, both Main Roads and the Shire of Northam received letters from residents asking for the bridge to be kept. In 1988, the Shire requested that Main Roads note the preservation value of the bridge, and retain it in any plans for road realignment. A decade later, in 1998, the bridge was placed on the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory, in category C – "conserve if possible". In that same year, it was included in an <a href="Engineers%20Australia">Institute of Engineers</a> survey of the state's large timber structures, as a current structure with "very high heritage value". By this time Great Eastern Highway's bypass of Clackline was being planned, but maintenance works continued to be undertaken as needed. The bypass was eventually constructed, with works beginning in January 2007, and the project completed in February 2008. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were still concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the <a href="Heritage%20Council%20of%20Western%20Australia">Heritage Council of Western Australia</a>'s Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008. The new highway alignment crosses Clackline Brook on a large box <a href="culvert">culvert</a>, giving vehicles a safer crossing than Clackline Bridge.

Horrible Histories (2009 TV series)

Horrible Histories is a British <a href="sketch%20comedy">sketch comedy</a> and <a href="Musical%20film">musical</a> television series, part of the <a href="Horrible%20Histories%20%28book%20series%29">children's history books of the same name</a>. The show was produced for <a href="CBBC">CBBC</a> by <a href="Lion%20Television">Lion Television</a> with Citrus Television and ran from 2009 to 2013 for five series of thirteen half-hour episodes, with additional one-off seasonal and Olympic specials.

The TV show carries over the graphic style and much of the content of the <a href="Horrible%20Histories%20%28book%20series%29">"Horrible Histories" book series</a>. It maintains the franchise's overall irreverent but accurate focus on the dark, gruesome or scatological aspects of British and other <a href="Western%20world">Western world</a> history, spanning from the <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> to the post-<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> era. Individual historical eras or civilisations are defined and named as in the books, with sketches from several different time periods combined within a single episode. <a href="Live-action">Live-action</a> sketches—which often parody other UK media or celebrities—and music videos are intercut with animations and quizzes. The starring troupe are <a href="Mathew%20Baynton">Mathew Baynton</a>, <a href="Simon%20Farnaby">Simon Farnaby</a>, <a href="Martha%20Howe-Douglas">Martha Howe-Douglas</a>, <a href="Jim%20Howick">Jim Howick</a>, <a href="Laurence%20Rickard">Laurence Rickard</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Hadland">Sarah Hadland</a> and <a href="Ben%20Willbond">Ben Willbond</a>, alongside a large supporting cast headed by <a href="Katy%20Wix">Katy Wix</a>, <a href="Lawry%20Lewin">Lawry Lewin</a>, <a href="Alice%20Lowe">Alice Lowe</a> and <a href="Dominique%20Moore">Dominique Moore</a>. The black rat puppet "host", Rattus Rattus, appears in short bridging segments, explaining the factual basis for each sketch.

The creative team was largely recruited from the mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as "<a href="Blackadder">Blackadder</a>" and the <a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a> films. The series was a critical and ratings success, eventually gaining a wide all ages audience through its non-condescending and inclusive approach. It has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.

In 2011, a spin-off game show, "", was launched on CBBC. In the same year, the original show was repackaged for main channel <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> as "<a href="Horrible%20Histories%20with%20Stephen%20Fry">Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry</a>", with <a href="Stephen%20Fry">Fry</a> replacing the puppet rat as presenter. <a href="Horrible%20Histories%20%282015%20TV%20series%29">A new series of special episodes</a> began airing in 2015, featuring a new format and cast. Although the original series has ended, it continues to be frequently repeated on the <a href="CBBC%20Channel">CBBC Channel</a> daily.

"Horrible Histories" is based on <a href="Horrible%20Histories%20%28book%20series%29">the British children's historical-comedy book series</a> by <a href="Terry%20Deary">Terry Deary</a>, first published by <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">Scholastic UK</a> in 1993 and since expanded into a <a href="Horrible%20Histories">multimedia franchise</a>. The books and subsequent spin-off materials are intended to pique young children's interest in history via short, factually based but humorously told anecdotes highlighting aspects of the subject not usually covered in more traditional educational sources.

LionTV executive producer Richard Bradley, whose company had previously produced several adult history-themed programmes and whose son was a fan of the "Horrible Histories" books, was the initial driving force behind a new TV adaptation. Deary was initially sceptical, having had a negative experience with the <a href="Horrible%20Histories%20%282001%20TV%20series%29">2001 animated series</a>, which had only loosely incorporated his concept. He finally agreed to the new project on the condition that it be explicitly "horrible, funny and true". While disclaiming any active role in developing the subsequent series, he would eventually contribute to the writing as well as appearing in several small roles.

The producers were determined that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director <a href="Dominic%20Brigstocke">Dominic Brigstocke</a> concluded that the material was strong enough to stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media <a href="Convention%20%28norm%29">conventions</a> as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.

To do the material full justice, Brigstocke and series producer Caroline Norris used their industry contacts to put together a creative team consisting mostly of veterans of the adult UK comedy community. The BBC readily agreed to this cross-demographic experiment. They also approved the adoption—insofar as was possible in a programme aimed at young children—of the core franchise precept of "history with the nasty bits left in", which frequently involved "<a href="Gross%20out">gross-out</a>"-style bodily function humour and comic violence.

The new creative team, while avoiding references aimed specifically at adults, was determined not to adapt the humour to children or otherwise patronise their audience. Instead, they sought to make the best use possible of the material. Norris said that her goal was "to make a show that people would say was too good for children ... we started out with really high ambitions." To that end, adult historical satires such as "<a href="Blackadder">Blackadder</a>" and the <a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a> films were shown at the first writers' meeting to demonstrate the proposed tone, and these influences would be visible throughout the show's run.
Once the first series had aired and it was realised that the overall approach was working well, the creative team built on and significantly expanded the scope of the comedy elements for the second. This trend continued through each subsequent series. The net result was a show that immediately appealed to young children while also gaining the increasing respect—and viewership—of older audiences.

The divisions by historical era or civilisation in the book series are carried over in the TV show, focusing on events in or directly affecting <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and (to a lesser extent) the larger <a href="Western%20world">Western world</a>. The <a href="Incan%20Empire">Inca</a> and <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> empires are also featured in later series. Sketches are grouped under these divisions, named as in the books, beginning with the Savage <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> and including among others the Cut-throat <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, Awful <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptians</a>, Groovy <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a>, Rotten <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, Vicious <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a>, Measly <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Terrible <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudors</a>, Slimy <a href="Stuart%20period">Stuarts</a>, Gorgeous <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgians</a> and Vile <a href="Victorians">Victorians</a>. The timeline for the most part ended at the Woeful Second World War. During the fifth and final series the show featured a handful of significant post-World War II (or "Troublesome Twentieth Century") events, including the civil rights movement and the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a> between the US and the USSR. The most recent event referenced was the 1969 <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11 Moon landing</a>.

Each named division has its own title card that appears before each sketch (or group of sketches) set in that era or civilisation, along with a short introductory animation featuring a period-appropriate character. Throughout each sketch, small pop-up signs are used to affirm the truth (or otherwise) of any particularly implausible-seeming concepts mentioned onscreen. The live-action material is intercut with short animated sketches, quizzes and interludes with puppet "host" Rattus Rattus (performed by <a href="John%20Eccleston">John Eccleston</a>), who addresses the viewer directly as a presenter, commenting on and clarifying the factual basis behind the humour. Rattus also occasionally holds up pop-up signs himself during sketches.

Sketches were filmed "en masse" and then cut into episodes by the producers based on creative rather than chronological or other educational considerations, in the manner of a more traditional sketch-comedy series. They often fall under a recurring banner—usually with its own short title sequence—but otherwise vary widely in length, visual style and approach. Many are recognisable parodies of other popular media or celebrities, in formats ranging from spoof commercials to mock TV shows, newscasts, magazines, video games and film trailers. Notable parody inspirations included "<a href="MasterChef%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Masterchef</a>", "<a href="Wife%20Swap%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Wife Swap</a>", "<a href="Come%20Dine%20with%20Me">Come Dine with Me</a>" and "<a href="The%20Apprentice%20%28TV%20series%29">The Apprentice</a>". "Horrible Histories Movie Pitch", in which historical figures pitch their life stories to a panel of Hollywood producers played by "<a href="The%20League%20of%20Gentlemen">League of Gentlemen</a>" actors <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>, <a href="Steve%20Pemberton">Steve Pemberton</a> and <a href="Reece%20Shearsmith">Reece Shearsmith</a>, used the format of a former commercial campaign for <a href="Orange%20%28UK%29%23Orange%20Gold%20Spots">Orange's cinema reminders to turn mobiles off</a>.

The show also created several popular recurring characters and concepts, notably "Stupid Deaths", in which a skeletal, platinum-blond <a href="Grim%20Reaper">Grim Reaper</a> amuses himself while processing souls for admittance to the afterlife by forcing candidates from throughout history to relate the embarrassing details of their demise. HHTV News' Bob Hale and his eccentric-but-erudite in-studio reports provide a broader picture on historical events (such as the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> and the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>), in a style reminiscent of presenter <a href="Peter%20Snow">Peter Snow</a>. The "Shouty Man", a parody of a typically ebullient <a href="infomercial">infomercial</a> host (like <a href="Neil%20Burgess%20%28actor%29">Barry Scott</a>), pitches unusual historical products.

Original music plays a significant role in the show and its popularity; "Music from "Horrible Histories"" was chosen as the <a href="Horrible%20Histories%20Prom">2011 theme</a> of the <a href="The%20Proms">BBC Proms</a>' annual children's concert. Alongside various short intro themes and commercial jingles, each episode and each special contains at least one longer comedy song centred around a particular historical figure or theme and performed by the cast in appropriate character.

In the first series, the songs generally had no particular satirical slant, and were often intercut with sketches from the same era. However, after the creative team noted the critical and popular success of the major exception ("Born 2 Rule", which featured <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">King Georges I–IV</a> performing in the style of a <a href="boyband">boyband</a>) the decision was taken from the second series onwards to continue in that vein. Historical concepts were matched to a diverse range of modern musical references, and the results were showcased as self-contained music video parodies. The thirteenth episode of the second and each subsequent series was retooled as a "Savage Songs" special, featuring a compilation of that series' outstanding videos.

The songs have since become among the most critically and popularly acclaimed elements of the show, especially among its adult audience. Commentators cite the apt cleverness of the various historical/musical parody match-ups, and the complexity and skill with which the musical elements are executed. Principal composer <a href="Richie%20Webb">Richie Webb</a> confirms that the songs became more sophisticated as a result of the show's increasing popularity with older viewers, as well as the demands of increased visibility online. Many of the videos have earned standalone popularity on YouTube.

The videos tend to run about three minutes, with two significant exceptions. "The English Kings and Queens", from the third series, lists all of the <a href="British%20monarchs">British monarchs</a> since <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, using a <a href="Chas%20%26amp%3B%20Dave">Chas & Dave</a>-inspired <a href="cumulative%20song">cumulative</a> format. The creative team wrote the song to challenge the show's young audience, after noting that the same youngsters had been inspired to memorise lyrics to previous songs. "We're History", styled as a grand finale for the show's final episode, uses stock footage from across the show's run to revisit every major era it ever featured in turn.

No formal educational method was applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official <a href="UK%20National%20Curriculum">UK National Curriculum</a> for primary school history. The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter <a href="Dan%20Snow">Dan Snow</a>. Writing in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", Gerard Gilbert notes that "Horrible Histories" is part of an extensive British <a href="Black%20comedy">black-comedy</a> tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.

Throughout, emphasis was placed on meshing comedy with the demands of historical accuracy, as defined by the mainstream scholarly consensus on the topic. This stance sometimes encompassed traditionally accepted if not actually well-documented anecdotes, such as those involving <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a>. All the material used on the show was vetted by production assistant and self-described "tyrannical pedant" Greg Jenner during both writing and filming; he says that he has counted only eight errors out of more than 4,000 facts presented over the course of the show's run. Costuming and makeup were likewise painstakingly recreated based on primary historical sources where available.

When an error was discovered, the effort was made to correct it whenever possible. This process is perhaps most noticeable in the evolution of a song featuring the four <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverian</a> King Georges: lyrics in the original 2009 video incorrectly saying that <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a> had "died on the <a href="Close%20stool">loo</a>" were correctly reassigned to <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a> for the song's reprise at the show's 2011 BBC Prom concert.

Taking cues from what Deary describes as his "seriously subversive" attitude towards the mainstream British history education model meant that the show inevitably incorporated sociopolitical comment. Perhaps most explicitly, Scots-Jamaican nurse <a href="Mary%20Seacole">Mary Seacole</a> was deliberately championed in both a sketch and later song as a forgotten heroine in the shadow of <a href="Florence%20Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a>. The activities of African-American activists <a href="Harriet%20Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a> and <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a> were also showcased, as was ex-slave boxer <a href="Bill%20Richmond">Bill Richmond</a>. According to Norris, a desire to include more women's stories was hampered by the traditionally male-dominated viewpoint of historical records. The show did make an attempt to counteract this by giving showcase songs to the British <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">women's suffrage</a> movement and <a href="Home%20front%20during%20World%20War%20II%23Mobilisation%20of%20women">women's work on the British homefront during World War II</a>, and wherever possible highlighting strong-willed, dynamic female figures, including <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Elizabeth I</a> and <a href="Boudicca">Boudicca</a>. Religious controversies, class divisions, the ethics of conquest, and labour conditions were likewise touched on.

The association with a proven and popular children's brand focusing on potentially sensitive subjects enabled the TV series to deflect any serious controversy regarding the same subjects, as they had demonstrably already been presented to children without any ill effects. Senior writer <a href="Steve%20Punt">Steve Punt</a> said that there were in fact very few complaints regarding the initial series' content, adding that "everyone was very relieved". The producers did consider some topics intrinsically unsuited for an irreverent comic treatment, as for instance the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> or the harsher details of slavery, and avoided them accordingly. Norris has described her personal criteria for age suitability as whether she would be nervous watching it with a ten-year-old. While BBC executives in large part were willing to concede the requirements of reflecting historical realities, some topics, notably suicide, needed careful handling to avoid potentially negative impact on younger viewers. The show sometimes acknowledged particularly emotive subject matter (the World War I <a href="Christmas%20truce">Christmas truce</a>, for example) by following up the sketch not with a joke, but a more sombre elaboration of the less comedic details.

The TV series used the <a href="Horrible%20Histories">Horrible Histories</a> brand, logo and associated trademarks under licence from publisher <a href="Scholastic%20Books">Scholastic Books</a>. It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television, with post-production being handled by Platform Post Production. Under series producer Norris and directors Brigstocke, Steve Connelly and Chloe Thomas, each series of thirteen episodes took approximately one year to produce. The process included several months of research into the historical facts, two to three months of writing, eight weeks of filming both on location and at London's <a href="Twickenham%20Studios">Twickenham Studios</a>, and three to four months of post-production.

At first the sketches were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable to the screen either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.

Inspiration for the music videos came from many different sources, and input from all members of the show's creative team was encouraged. With the exception of "A Gorgeous Georgian Lady", adapted by Deary from his book "Gorgeous Georgians", all songs were original to the series. Once Jenner and Norris had finalised the subject matter and music genre, lyrics were commissioned from the writing team, usually <a href="Dave%20Cohen%20%28writer%29">Dave Cohen</a>. These were rewritten as needed under Norris' supervision to ensure as much factual information as possible was included. Webb then composed and recorded each song's instrumental track at Noisegate Studios, hewing as closely as possible to the style of the genre or artist in question. The finished vocal and backing tracks were later returned to Noisegate for post-production by Webb and colleague Matt Katz.

The 2D animated sequences were directed by Tim Searle of Baby Cow Animation, based on <a href="Martin%20Brown%20%28artist%29">Martin Brown</a>'s illustrations for the books. They were voiced by <a href="Jon%20Culshaw">Jon Culshaw</a> and <a href="Jess%20Robinson">Jess Robinson</a> along with various regular cast members. Video game-styled sketches were achieved using a mix of <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> animation and live-action <a href="green-screen">green-screen</a> footage. Properties frequently were modified foodstuffs, with melted chocolate bars standing in for excrement and soup for vomit.

Each series debuted in the UK in April or May from 2009 to 2013, and on international channels including Canada's <a href="BBC%20Kids">BBC Kids</a>, Malaysia's <a href="NTV7">NTV7</a>, The Philippines <a href="GMA%20Network">GMA Network</a>, and Australia's <a href="ABC3">ABC3</a>. Six special episodes, comprising a mix of new and existing material around a single theme, were broadcast in the UK. "Horrible Christmas" (aired in 2010) was followed by a "Sport Special" (July 2012, to coincide with the <a href="2012%20London%20Olympic%20Games">2012 London Olympic Games</a>) and a "Scary Special" (autumn 2012, themed around <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a>). "Ridiculous Romance" (themed around <a href="Valentine%27s%20Day">Valentine's Day</a>) aired in February 2014; the "Frightful First World War Special" aired later the same year, as part of the BBC's commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

In autumn 2011, the BBC edited footage from the show's <a href="Horrible%20Histories%20Prom">summer Prom concert</a> into an hour-long TV special ("Horrible Histories' Big Prom Party"), featuring specially shot linking sketches. In addition, standalone sketches hosted by <a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a>, as well as a special "Bob Hale Report", were produced as part of the 2012 <a href="Sport%20Relief">Sport Relief</a> benefit programme. In the same year, several sketches were commissioned as part of the BBC's live television coverage of the <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II</a>, to be performed on <a href="Tower%20Bridge">Tower Bridge</a>, but due to time constraints only one was aired.

The producers decided to cease full-time production after the fifth series, citing concerns around the increasing difficulty in finding suitable historical material. However, the possibility of further specials marking important historical or holiday milestones has been discussed.

In 2015, the BBC announced that the "Horrible Histories" concept would be revived in a new format, focussing on the life and times of a single historical figure per episode. The <a href="Horrible%20Histories%20%282015%20TV%20series%29">rebooted series</a> was again developed by LionTV and will involve a largely all-new production team and cast, while still retaining Jenner as lead historical consultant and many of the original series's writers. In addition, original stars Farnaby and Howick will return in limited roles.

The cast members were recruited from sketch and character comedy, having previously had roles in "<a href="Gavin%20%26amp%3B%20Stacey">Gavin & Stacey</a>", "<a href="Peep%20Show%20%28TV%20series%29">Peep Show</a>", "<a href="The%20Thick%20of%20It">The Thick of It</a>" and "<a href="The%20Mighty%20Boosh%20%28TV%20series%29">The Mighty Boosh</a>" TV series among others. Several of the writers and researchers also occasionally appeared in front of the camera, including Punt, Jenner, George Sawyer and Susie Donkin, while actors <a href="Mathew%20Baynton">Mathew Baynton</a> and <a href="Ben%20Willbond">Ben Willbond</a> sometimes contributed to the writing. <a href="Laurence%20Rickard">Laurence Rickard</a> was recruited solely as a writer, but found himself part of both the senior writing staff and starring cast after creating the character of Bob Hale, whose extended, convoluted monologues proved impossible to hand over to anyone else.

Individual sketches and songs were cast by the production team, sometimes acting on input from the show's stable of performers themselves. While certain roles naturally lent themselves to a particular actor, Norris said that confidence in the entire cast's ability was such that the producers also experimented with casting against type. The demands of filming thirteen episodes' worth of material in the same timeframe as a standard six-episode sketch show, while coping with the many complex makeup and wardrobe changes required, resulted in casting also being partially dependent on the logistics of moving a performer from one character to another. Recurring characters were if at all possible played by the actor who had originated the part, leading to the development of several signature roles, as for example Baynton's <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, <a href="Jim%20Howick">Jim Howick</a>'s Shouty Man, Rickard's Bob Hale, Willbond's <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>, <a href="Martha%20Howe-Douglas">Martha Howe-Douglas</a>' <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Elizabeth I</a> and <a href="Simon%20Farnaby">Simon Farnaby</a>'s <a href="Grim%20Reaper">Death</a>.

The performers were allowed to improvise provided that they maintained factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary due to the rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very little time to prepare for individual roles. On the other hand, both Rickard and Baynton suggest this enforced spontaneity may have ultimately worked to enhance the comedy, not least by preventing the jokes from becoming over-rehearsed.

Six performers (Baynton, Howick, Rickard, Willbond, Howe-Douglas and Farnaby) were credited as main or starring cast throughout the show's run; a seventh, <a href="Sarah%20Hadland">Sarah Hadland</a>, left after the second series but returned with an "also starring" credit for the fourth and fifth. The initial sextet appeared from Series 2 onwards as the standard face of the show at premieres and other press opportunities, and performed as a troupe for such peripheral events as the show's BBC Prom concert. They became a particularly close-knit group both personally and professionally. Eventually this led them to continue working together after "Horrible Histories" ceased full-time production, creating, writing and starring in the TV series "<a href="Yonderland">Yonderland</a>" and feature film comedy "<a href="Bill%20%282015%20film%29">Bill</a>".

The supporting cast varied considerably by series. Those performers with additional speaking parts are listed below:

Puppeteer <a href="John%20Eccleston">John Eccleston</a>, operates the <a href="puppet">puppet</a> rat host, Rattus Rattus, whilst also supplying his voice. <a href="Scott%20Brooker">Scott Brooker</a> performs additional puppetry. <a href="Jon%20Culshaw">Jon Culshaw</a>, <a href="Jess%20Robinson">Jess Robinson</a>, and <a href="Dave%20Lamb">Dave Lamb</a> provide various additional voice-overs and narration throughout the series.

The show has attracted several special guest stars. In the fourth series, Gatiss, Shearsmith and Pemberton of "<a href="The%20League%20of%20Gentlemen">The League of Gentlemen</a>" joined the show, playing the panel of Hollywood producers for the "Movie Pitch" sketches. Shearsmith said, "Mark and I independently thought it was just a brilliant show that works on a number of levels ... There's not a weak link in the team here and it's an honour to be asked to be part of it". Other featured guests included:

"Horrible Histories" was immediately, and almost universally, greeted with critical enthusiasm. On its debut, Alice-Azania Jarvis of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" described the show as "fun, filthy and genuinely engaging, in a peer-to-peer way." Harry Venning in "<a href="The%20Stage">The Stage</a>" approved the "seriously funny, beautifully performed and endlessly inventive sketches" along with "plenty of crowd-pleasing fart and poo gags." By the second series, the show's cross-generational appeal was beginning to attract significant attention from adult media. Naomi West of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" characterised the first series as "boundary-pushing", suggesting that "the bold decision to approach the series in the same way as an adult show has been the key to its success ... [it] delivers more laughs than most post-watershed comedies." <a href="James%20Delingpole">James Delingpole</a> in "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" likewise recommended the show to viewers of all ages, saying that "Even though there are vast quantities of entirely gratuitous fart, bottom and wee wee jokes, the cumulative effect—bizarrely—is one of dumbing up rather than down." Discussing the first two series in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", television writer <a href="Jesse%20Armstrong">Jesse Armstrong</a> said that "Hit shows are very difficult to achieve. You need to have everything just right—that's what's so terrifying. But "Horrible Histories" has a great cast and brilliant writers. They're also blessed with great source material. The tone is perfect and it is done in a non-patronising, engaging way".

Clare Heal of the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", in her review of the third series, praised the show's "spot-on spoofs of modern telly" and agreed that "There's no particular target audience but pretty much anyone of any age will find something in there for them". Kerrie Mills of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> rated the first three series 9/10, opining that the show "does also provide evidence, edgewise between the falling bodily fluids, of a sharp comic intelligence ... in fact, it might just be one of the most successful original comedy shows to appear in years." Stephen Kelly of "The Guardian" argued that the fourth series had definitively transcended its roots to become not just "the best show on children's television—it's one of the smartest comedies on TV", performed by an "astonishing cast ... so superb that even special guest stars such as Chris Addison can look slightly out of their depth." In an article discussing the "League of Gentlemen" troupe's appearance in the same series, the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>"' Gareth McLean agreed that "despite nominally being a children's programme, "Horrible Histories" is one of the best sketch comedies on TV", adding that "ultimately, comedy performers relish [the] madcap, sometimes deliciously silly exuberance, which, thanks to the show's razorsharp writing, educates as well as entertains." Graeme Virtue of "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>" called the League's reunion a "coup" for the series: "While Gatiss's American accent was pretty duff, the bickering spark between the three Gentlemen remained."

In her review of the fifth series, <a href="Deborah%20Ross%20%28journalist%29">Deborah Ross</a> of the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" wrote of her sheer pleasure in watching the show without her children, calling it "still unfailingly brilliant and funny and silly, without ever losing its sense of purpose ... There just isn't anything else on TV that can match it for ideas, writing and performance." Sarah Dempster of "The Guardian" agreed, adding that "Four years into its ingenious 'making history look less crap' operation ... HH remains true to its aim, with meticulously harvested historical data + roaringly well-observed pop culture pastiches = seemingly infinite heritage lolz." Writing in "The Independent", <a href="Grace%20Dent">Grace Dent</a> commended the cast in particular, saying that the show "has the distinct feel of a group of bright, young, erudite, writery-actory sparks having a tremendously good time." Venning of "The Stage" reiterated his praise of the show, adding that "it also has the courage to tackle potentially controversial events head on", specifically citing the song featuring the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> activist <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a> as retelling her story in a "clever, concise and accessible way without trivialising it." In 2016, Margaret Lyons of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" praised the series as "deeply silly", "frequently hilarious", and,"very consistent".

Most criticism of the show revolves around the accuracy and presentation of its factual content. The TV series, like the books, has been used by educators as a classroom aid and was endorsed by UK Education Secretary <a href="Michael%20Gove">Michael Gove</a> as useful for spotlighting "neglected periods of history." However, writing after the final episode, <a href="Simon%20Hoggart">Simon Hoggart</a> in "The Spectator" noted that "There has been some whipped-up controversy about "Horrible Histories"", adding that "where the books make a rudimentary attempt to teach history as a series of interconnected events, the television show is basically gags, chiefly about defecation, gluttony, murder and torture. It's quite amusing, though whether it will pique an interest in the subject, or—as some say—merely encourage children to learn more about defecation, gluttony, murder and torture, we cannot know."

More specifically, in September 2014, responding to a complaint from the Nightingale Society, the BBC Trust determined that the show had breached editorial guidelines in the sketch highlighting the controversy surrounding Mary Seacole's role in nursing history. In this sketch, Florence Nightingale says that she rejected the Jamaican-born Seacole's application to Nightingale's Crimean nursing corps because it was open to "British girls" only. This was held to be imputing racially discriminatory motives to Nightingale—and thus implying them to be historical fact—without sufficient proof. In response, the BBC pulled the offending sketch from their website and announced it would be removed from future showings of the episode.

In a 20th-anniversary retrospective of the franchise in "The Telegraph", <a href="David%20Horspool">David Horspool</a>, the history editor of the "<a href="Times%20Literary%20Supplement">Times Literary Supplement</a>", defended the show's overall viewpoint, saying, "There's no particular reason why grown-up historians shouldn't like "Horrible Histories" too ... They simplify, and they have a definite point of view, but all historians are guilty of that to some degree." He further said that "Getting children interested in the past isn't necessarily easy, and "Horrible Histories" does it extremely effectively—and those who come to history because it's fun seem far more likely to stay with it in the long run." Writing for entertainment website DorkAdore, Anna Lowman added that "Terry Deary had the fine idea of getting kids into history by giving the facts a human face and a joke or two ... The producers of the CBBC show have perfectly transferred Deary's ethos to television."

The recut for BBC1 with Fry as host drew particular criticism as to whether its educational methods were suited to an adult demographic. "<a href="History%20Today">History Today</a>" editor Paul Lay called the idea "frightening". Historian and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party MP</a> <a href="Tristram%20Hunt">Tristram Hunt</a>, while admitting that he had not yet actually seen the programme, voiced his concerns that the show's content was not "challenging and stimulating" enough for the BBC, adding that "For children, "Horrible Histories" is an exciting aid to engage with the guts and gore of the past, but there are more sophisticated, populist ways of getting people involved in history than this. I'm in favour of populism, but there has to be a bit of depth to it."

Other critics have taken a more lenient view. Historian and television presenter Dan Snow described the show's "modus operandi" as "one step above "Blackadder", but that's fine ... it plays to stereotypes, but it's fantastic as entry-level history." Writing in "The Independent", <a href="Tom%20Sutcliffe%20%28broadcaster%29">Tom Sutcliffe</a> noted that "As a grown-up you might quibble with the fact that they don't always distinguish between things that genuinely are true and the things that people would like to be (sadly, there's no hard evidence that <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> was brained by a tortoise dropped by an overflying eagle)", but added that "children and adults alike should enjoy the gleefully anachronistic way in which the information is presented." Dent in "The Guardian", while conceding what she called the show's "frankly slapdash, dumbed-down approach to history", also argued that "in "Horrible Histories" there are always serious messages lurking amid the silliness."

In its debut week of 15 June 2009, the show topped the UK children's TV viewing figures with 191,000 viewers. The first series reached a viewing peak of 50% of UK children aged 6–12, while the second was watched by 34% of UK children aged 6–12, or 1.6 million total. Throughout its run, the show routinely ranked at or near the top of the CBBC ratings, reaching a peak of 548,000 viewers for Episode 10 of Series 5.

"Horrible Histories" received numerous domestic and international awards and nominations, including several <a href="BAFTA%20Children%27s%20Awards">BAFTA Children's Awards</a>, two <a href="British%20Comedy%20Awards">British Comedy Awards</a> and a <a href="Rose%20d%27Or">Rose d'Or</a> Award for Best Children's Programme. It is the first children's programme to win a British Comedy Award and four successive children's BAFTAs, for Best Comedy. In 2013 the show was also named in a "Radio Times" poll of all-time greatest British children's TV series, and was cited at No. 8 in a similar Top 50 list presented later the same year by <a href="Channel%20Five">Channel Five</a>.

All five series of the original show, plus the "Scary (Halloween) Special", "Ridiculous Romance" & the "Frightful First World War Special" and "Horrible Christmas" have been released on <a href="DVD%20region%20code%232">Region 2</a> DVD by 2entertain for the BBC, both individually and as boxed sets.

Each series, as well as the "Scary Special" and "Sport Special", are also available for download from the UK iTunes store. As of February 2014, all episodes from Series 1–3 were available for download to American audiences on Amazon.com "Instant Video" service.

In 2011, a spinoff game show, "", was launched on CBBC. Likewise coproduced by Lion TV and Citrus, the show is co-hosted by <a href="Dave%20Lamb">Dave Lamb</a> with puppet Rattus Rattus and includes cameos from many of the parent show's cast. As of 2013, the show had aired three full series. For summer 2011, the show was repackaged for adult Sunday-night audiences as "<a href="Horrible%20Histories%20with%20Stephen%20Fry">Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry</a>", a six-part "best of" compilation for main channel <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>. The show featured a selection of sketches and songs from the first two series as chosen by the producers of the parent show, with Fry replacing the puppet rat as presenter.

On 18 September 2015 "<a href="Bill%20%282015%20film%29">Bill</a>", a 2015 BBC comedy film based loosely around the early life of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, was released. The film, though not officially related to the series, reunited and starred the original core performers of "Horrible Histories" in starring roles.

In October 2017, it was announced that <a href="Altitude%20Film%20Distribution">Altitude Film Entertainment</a> and Citrus Films were producing a film adaptation. <a href="Dominic%20Brigstocke">Dominic Brigstocke</a> will direct, and it will be set in Roman Britain. The film, "" will be released July 26, 2019. The original cast of the TV series are not involved, although members of the revival cast are.

1880 Greenback National Convention

The 1880 Greenback Party National Convention convened in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> from June 9 to 11, 1880, to select presidential and vice presidential nominees and write a <a href="party%20platform">party platform</a> for the <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">United States presidential election of 1880</a>. Delegates chose <a href="James%20B.%20Weaver">James B. Weaver</a> of <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> and <a href="Barzillai%20J.%20Chambers">Barzillai J. Chambers</a> of <a href="Texas">Texas</a> for <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a>.

The Greenback Party was a newcomer to the political scene in 1880, having arisen, mostly in the nation's <a href="Western%20United%20States">West</a> and <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>, as a response to the economic depression that followed the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> had authorized "<a href="United%20States%20Note">greenbacks</a>", a form of money redeemable in <a href="United%20States%20Treasury%20security">government bonds</a>, rather than in gold as was traditional. After the war, many <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democrats</a> and <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republicans</a> in the East sought to return to the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>, and the government began to withdraw greenbacks from circulation. The reduction of the <a href="money%20supply">money supply</a>, combined with the economic depression, made life harder for debtors, farmers, and industrial laborers; the Greenback Party hoped to draw support from these groups.

Six men were candidates for the presidential nomination. Weaver, an Iowa congressman and Civil War general, was the clear favorite, but two other congressmen, <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin F. Butler</a> of Massachusetts and <a href="Hendrick%20B.%20Wright">Hendrick B. Wright</a> of Pennsylvania, also commanded considerable followings. Weaver triumphed quickly, winning a majority of the 850 delegates' votes on the first ballot. Chambers, a Texas businessman and <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> veteran, was likewise nominated on the initial vote. More tumultuous was the fight over the platform, as delegates from disparate factions of the left-wing movement clashed over <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Chinese%20Americans">Chinese immigration</a>, and the extent to which the government should <a href="United%20States%20labor%20law">regulate working conditions</a>. Votes for women was the most contentious of these, with the party ultimately endorsing the suffragists' cause, despite a vocal minority's opposition.

Weaver and Chambers left the convention with high hopes for the <a href="Third%20party%20%28United%20States%29">third party</a>'s cause, but in the end they were disappointed. The election was a close contest between the Republican, <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a>, and the Democrat, <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>, with Garfield being the narrow victor. The Greenback ticket placed a distant third, netting just over three percent of the popular vote.

The <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a> was a newcomer to politics in 1880, having first nominated candidates for national office <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">four years earlier</a>. The party had arisen, mostly in the West and South, as a response to the economic depression that followed the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, Congress had authorized "<a href="United%20States%20Note">greenbacks</a>", a new form of <a href="fiat%20money">fiat money</a> that was redeemable not <a href="Gold%20standard">in gold</a> but in government bonds. The greenbacks had helped to finance the war when the government's gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies. When the crisis had passed, many in both the Democratic and Republican parties, especially in the East, wanted to return the nation's currency to a gold standard as soon as possible (candidates who favored the gold-backed currency were called "hard money" supporters, while the policy of encouraging inflation was known as "soft money"). The <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">Specie Payment Resumption Act</a>, passed in 1875, ordered that greenbacks be gradually withdrawn and replaced with gold-backed currency, beginning in 1879. At the same time, <a href="Long%20Depression">economic depression</a> had made it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans offered a home to those who favored retaining greenbacks, so many looked to create a third party that would address their concerns. Greenbackers drew support from the growing labor movement in the nation's Eastern cities, as well as from Western and Southern farmers who had been harmed by <a href="deflation">deflation</a>. Beyond their support for a larger money supply, they also favored an <a href="eight-hour%20day">eight-hour work day</a>, safety regulations in factories, and an end to <a href="Child%20labor%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States">child labor</a>. As one author put it, they "anticipated by almost fifty years the progressive legislation of the first quarter of the twentieth century".

In 1876, various independent <a href="1876%20Greenback%20National%20Convention">delegates gathered</a> in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> to nominate a presidential ticket to campaign on those issues. For president, they chose <a href="Peter%20Cooper">Peter Cooper</a>, an 85-year-old industrialist and philanthropist from New York, with <a href="Samuel%20Fenton%20Cary">Samuel Fenton Cary</a>, a former congressman from Ohio, as his running mate. The Greenback ticket fared poorly in the election that November, attracting just 81,740 votes—less than 1% of the total. As bad economic times continued, however, the party gained momentum. Labor unrest the following year, culminating in the <a href="Great%20Railroad%20Strike%20of%201877">Great Railroad Strike of 1877</a>, added to many laborers' alienation from the two major parties. Local movements, like California's <a href="Workingmen%27s%20Party%20of%20California">Workingmen's Party</a>, began to agitate for laws to improve the condition of laborers (and for an end to <a href="History%20of%20Chinese%20Americans">Chinese immigration</a>). By 1878, the third-party movement had become strong enough to elect 22 independents to the federal <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, most tied in some way to the Greenback movement. As the 1880 presidential election approached, members of the Greenback Party (or Greenback-Labor Party, as it was sometimes known) had reason to believe that they could improve on the results of 1876.

Attempts to fuse the disparate state and local parties into a national force led to friction between party leaders. By 1879, there was a clear split, as a group led by <a href="Marcus%20M.%20Pomeroy">Marcus M. "Brick" Pomeroy</a> formed their own "Union Greenback Labor Party". Pomeroy's group of mostly Southern and Western Greenbackers was opposed to <a href="electoral%20fusion">electoral fusion</a> with either of the two major parties, and took more radical positions on monetary policy—including payment of all federal bonds in greenbacks, rather than the gold dollars originally promised to investors. They also differed from the Eastern-centered <a href="rump%20party">rump party</a> (often called the "National Greenback Party") in calling for the popular election of <a href="postmaster">postmaster</a>s and the <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States">death penalty</a> as punishment for <a href="political%20corruption">corruption</a> in public office. After a January 1880 conference in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> failed to unite the factions, each party called for its own national convention to nominate candidates for president.

The Union Greenbackers held their convention first, meeting in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> in March 1880. Although much of the young party's leadership remained with the Eastern faction, the March gathering included <a href="Solon%20Chase">Solon Chase</a> and <a href="Kersey%20Graves">Kersey Graves</a>, among other third-party notables. They nominated <a href="Stephen%20D.%20Dillaye">Stephen D. Dillaye</a>, a New Jersey lawyer and journalist, for President and <a href="Barzillai%20J.%20Chambers">Barzillai J. Chambers</a>, a Texas merchant and surveyor, for Vice President. Because Dillaye had previously declared he was not interested in the nomination, many delegates protested, seeing Dillaye as a placeholder for eventual re-unification with the National Greenbackers. Dillaye himself supported reunification, and Pomeroy also urged the delegates to send representatives to the Easterners' convention, which was set for June 1880 in Chicago. The majority agreed with the sentiment, and Union Greenbackers gathered in Chicago along with National Greenbackers as their convention began a few months later.

<a href="James%20B.%20Weaver">James Baird Weaver</a> grew up on the <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> frontier, and was involved with the Republican Party from its early days in the late 1850s. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>. Weaver saw action at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Shiloh</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Resaca">Resaca</a>, and rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general. After the war, he continued to be active in Iowa Republican politics. Weaver sought nomination to the House of Representatives and the Governorship, but each time was defeated by candidates from the party's more conservative faction, led by <a href="William%20B.%20Allison">William B. Allison</a>. He campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> in 1876, but also attended the 1876 Greenback National Convention as an observer.

By 1877, differences with the Republican party leadership on the money question led him to consider other options. After initially supporting the Republican candidate for governor that year, Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for <a href="Iowa%27s%206th%20congressional%20district">Iowa's 6th congressional district</a>. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely the only way to defeat <a href="Ezekiel%20S.%20Sampson">Ezekiel S. Sampson</a>, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.

Weaver entered the <a href="46th%20United%20States%20Congress">46th Congress</a> in March 1879. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party included the Greenbackers in its caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation. Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing the use of the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the <a href="Disenfranchisement%20after%20the%20Reconstruction%20Era">violence against black Southerners</a> that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would put an end to the sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the <a href="Free%20silver">unlimited coinage of silver</a>, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas, he was soon considered the front-runner for the presidential nomination in 1880.

<a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Franklin Butler</a> was born in <a href="Deerfield%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Deerfield, New Hampshire</a>, and later moved to Massachusetts to pursue a legal career. He built a successful practice in the 1840s and 1850s, and became involved in local politics as a Democrat. A compelling public speaker, Butler was first elected to the <a href="Massachusetts%20House%20of%20Representatives">Massachusetts House of Representatives</a> in 1853. He successfully ran for a <a href="Massachusetts%20Senate">Massachusetts Senate</a> seat in 1859. Despite his Protestant upbringing he gained a faithful following among Massachusetts Catholics, and also built support among laborers. In the 1860 presidential campaign, Butler sought compromise with the <a href="slave%20power">slave power</a>, and believed Senator <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> of Mississippi ought to be the Democratic Party's nominee for president.

Butler had been elected a brigadier general of the Massachusetts militia, and when the Civil War began in 1861, he quickly organized his men and marched south. Butler's men occupied <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> to ensure that Maryland <a href="Maryland%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">did not follow</a> its fellow Southern states into secession. He was promoted to major general in May of that year, and sent to command at <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a> in Virginia, where he pioneered the tactic of seizing and freeing slaves as "<a href="Contraband%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">contraband</a> of war". When Union forces captured <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, Butler was sent to command there. Butler's rule was harsh, and he became especially reviled among Southern whites, to whom he was known as "Beast" Butler. He was transferred to the <a href="Eastern%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Virginia theater</a> in 1863, where he worked under General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s direction in the campaigns that led to the Confederacy's defeat.

After the war, Butler was elected to Congress as a Republican, and soon came to identify with that party's <a href="Radical%20Republican">more radical element</a>. In 1868, he was among the leaders in President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>'s <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">impeachment</a>. Butler's wartime exploits earned him support among blacks and <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a>s, which, combined with his existing base among laborers, ensured his reelection for several terms. His radicalism made him enemies among conservative Republicans, however, and when he lost his seat in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201874">Democratic wave of 1874</a>, he began to shift his allegiance to the nascent Greenback Party. In 1876, he returned to the House as a Republican, but in 1878 he ran unsuccessfully for <a href="Governor%20of%20Massachusetts">Governor of Massachusetts</a> as an independent Greenbacker with Democratic support. Butler had supporters across the political spectrum—he was often said to be "a member of all parties and false to each"—and was considered a presidential possibility when the Greenbackers convened in Chicago in 1880.

<a href="Hendrick%20Bradley%20Wright">Hendrick Bradley Wright</a> was born and raised in northeastern Pennsylvania. After studying law at <a href="Dickinson%20College">Dickinson College</a>, Wright returned to <a href="Wilkes-Barre%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wilkes-Barre</a> and quickly became known as a gifted attorney and orator. His powers of speech earned him notice in Pennsylvania Democratic Party circles, as well as the nickname "Old-Man-Not-Afraid-To-Be-Called-A-Demagogue". He became a district attorney for <a href="Luzerne%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Luzerne County</a> in 1834 and was elected to the <a href="Pennsylvania%20House%20of%20Representatives">Pennsylvania House of Representatives</a> in 1841. Wright was reelected in 1842 and 1843, serving as Speaker in his final term. He served as president of the <a href="1844%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1844 Democratic National Convention</a>, working with the anti-<a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Van Buren</a> faction to prevent that former President's nomination. After the convention, he sought a seat in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>, but was unsuccessful.

Wright was defeated for election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1850, but was successful in 1852. Defeated for reelection in 1854, he ran in 1860 as a Democrat with Republican support, and was elected to represent <a href="Pennsylvania%27s%2012th%20congressional%20district">Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district</a>. He spoke against the <a href="Peace%20Democrat">Peace Democrat</a>s early in the Civil War, but by 1864, believing the Union war aims had changed for the worse, he supported Democrat <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> for the presidency. Wright did not run for reelection, returning to private life in 1863. He continued his legal career, and published writings on the relationship between labor and capital. His book "A Practical Treatise on Labor" was published in 1871.

In 1876, Wright was elected to his old seat in Congress as a Democrat, but with support from the small Greenback movement. In 1878, the situation was reversed: Wright ran as a Greenbacker, but was reelected with support by Democrats. He attracted attention in Congress with his proposal to amend the <a href="Homestead%20Acts">Homestead Act of 1862</a> to establish government loans to would-be settlers of the West, making it easier for landless Easterners to claim homesteads there. Congress was, on the whole, not receptive to Wright's proposal. Wright proposed it again in 1879 and emphasized the conservatism of his proposal, that it was a loan secured by the homestead, not a gift from the state; even so, the bill went down to overwhelming defeat. Despite his failure, Wright, like Weaver, had raised his profile as a potential presidential nominee by attempting to advance Greenback ideas in Congress.

Several <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a> candidates had delegates interested in their nomination, although they were seen as having less of a chance of gaining the nomination. <a href="Alexander%20Campbell%20%28Illinois%20politician%29">Alexander Campbell</a> had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives several years earlier. He was seen as a pragmatist who represented the Greenback Party's more conservative members. <a href="Henly%20James">Henly James</a> was the head of the <a href="The%20National%20Grange%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Patrons%20of%20Husbandry">Grange</a> in Indiana and had served in the state legislature there, but attracted little support outside his own delegation. In the Wisconsin delegation, many favored <a href="Edward%20P.%20Allis">Edward P. Allis</a>, an industrialist who owned the Reliance Iron Works. Allis was a longtime supporter of soft money, but had no experience in elected office. Finally, <a href="Solon%20Chase">Solon Chase</a> of Maine had some support from the New England delegations. Chase was a publisher of a Greenback newspaper, "Chase's Inquirer", and had narrowly lost a House election in 1878. Chase was among the most radical of the Greenbackers, attracting support from the party's left-wing members.

The National Greenback Party delegates assembled in the Interstate Exposition Building in Chicago on Wednesday, June 9, 1880. The <a href="1880%20Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican convention</a> took place in the same building, and had only just ended after a record 36 rounds of balloting. When the Greenbackers arrived, the Republicans' banners still hung from the walls, so the delegates were greeted by images of <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a> as they entered. The building, popularly known as the "Glass Palace", had been built in 1873 for an Interstate Industrial Exposition.

Franklin P. Dewees of the party's executive committee called the convention to order at 12:30 p.m. on June 9. Reverend Pearl P. Ingalls of Iowa said a brief prayer, and the convention was opened. <a href="Gilbert%20De%20La%20Matyr">Gilbert De La Matyr</a>, a Methodist minister and Greenback congressman from Indiana, was unanimously chosen as temporary chairman. After De La Matyr gave a brief, fiery speech, they proceeded to call the roll, which included delegates from every state except Oregon. As the roll call finished, <a href="Matilda%20Joslyn%20Gage">Matilda Joslyn Gage</a>, a <a href="suffragist">suffragist</a>, mounted the stage, provoking cheers from some delegates and howls of outrage from others. She called for the new party to recognize women's right to vote, but the issue was avoided temporarily when the delegates voted to send her petition to a committee for further study.

The Union Greenback convention had reconvened at nearby Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. The delegates voted to join the other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While they waited for the committees to finish their work, the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including <a href="Denis%20Kearney">Denis Kearney</a>, a California labor leader, and <a href="William%20Wallace%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">William Wallace</a>, a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for currency reform. Meanwhile, the Credentials Committee voted narrowly to admit the Union Greenbackers, as well as a delegation from the <a href="Socialist%20Labor%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Labor Party</a>. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend <a href="Richard%20F.%20Trevellick">Richard F. Trevellick</a>, a Michigan <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.

When they reconvened, the Credentials Committee announced that there were 608 regularly selected delegates, and recommended the admission of 185 Union Greenbackers and 44 Socialist Laborites, along with a handful of others. After a spirited and chaotic discussion, the convention voted to admit the other delegates in a voice vote: the party was reunified. Messages were sent to the Union Greenbackers and Socialist Laborites informing them of the results. In the meantime, the women's suffrage supporters again tried to convince the delegates to endorse their cause. <a href="Sara%20Andrews%20Spencer">Sara Andrews Spencer</a> took the stage to give an impassioned argument for women's right to vote, while Kearney climbed a nearby platform to shout his disapproval. Their informal debate was interrupted by a brass band, announcing the arrival of the Union Greenbackers and Socialist Laborites. The convention erupted in prolonged cheering and a banner with the word "Reunion" was hoisted. The convention broke for a brief recess as the delegates renewed their acquaintance with the erstwhile schismatics.

The delegates voted to address the platform before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45 p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread agreement among the delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for <a href="National%20Bank%20Note">paper money at the time</a>). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, and an end to child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.

Social issues provoked greater disagreement. Kearney's Western faction gained a victory when the platform was made to include a call for an end to Chinese immigration. They also turned, at last, to the issue of suffrage. They eventually agreed on a vague statement in the platform, that the party would "denounce as dangerous, the efforts everywhere manifest to restrict the right of suffrage". Many of the delegates found this unsatisfying, and called for a separate resolution on the subject. After more debate, a resolution calling for the enfranchisement of "every citizen" passed by a vote of 528 to 124. The Socialist Labor faction proposed another resolution declaring "that land, air, and water are the grand gifts of nature to all mankind", and that no person had a right to monopolize them; the convention applauded, but the proposal was shunted off to a committee.

It was nearly midnight on Thursday night when the platform fights were finished, but the delegates voted to proceed immediately to nominations for President. At 1:00 Friday morning, the roll call began. S.F. Norton proposed his fellow Illinoisan, Alexander Campbell, proclaiming his great financial knowledge and association with Lincoln. James Buchanan, the editor of the "<a href="Indianapolis%20Sun">Indianapolis Sun</a>", proposed Benjamin Butler. Iowa Congressman <a href="Edward%20H.%20Gillette">Edward H. Gillette</a> nominated Weaver, and Frank M. Fogg of Maine proposed "the farmer's friend", Solon Chase. Perry Talbot of Missouri nominated the Union Greenbackers' nominee, Stephen D. Dillaye, who immediately asked that his name be withdrawn. Pennsylvania's delegation nominated Hendrick Wright, and Wisconsin's closed with the nomination of Edward P. Allis.

With the time now 3:25 a.m., the delegates took an informal ballot. Weaver led the pack with about 30% of the votes, with Wright, Dillaye, and Butler trailing at about 15% each and the remaining votes scattered among the remaining candidates. Supporters of Wright and Butler talked of combining their forces, but the momentum favored Weaver. In the first formal ballot, at 4:10 a.m., Weaver gained votes, and delegates began shifting their ballots to him. Without any official motion, the nomination was made unanimous, and the brass band again began to play. Weaver, who was staying at the nearby <a href="The%20Palmer%20House%20Hilton">Palmer House</a> hotel, was summoned to the convention. As they waited, the delegates turned to the vice presidential nomination. Some of Butler's supporters proposed nominating <a href="Absolom%20M.%20West">Absolom M. West</a> of Mississippi, a more conservative Greenbacker, to balance the ticket against Weaver, whom they regarded as radical. West, who was present at the convention, had already disappointed the radicals by opposing women's suffrage and the eight-hour day. They instead proposed <a href="Barzillai%20J.%20Chambers">Barzillai J. Chambers</a> of Texas, who had been the Union Greenbackers' nominee for vice president. The majority agreed, as Chambers took 403 votes to West's 311.

Weaver had still not arrived, and the Socialist Labor delegates took the opportunity to call for a re-vote on their land plank and the women's suffrage issue. The delegates overruled the chairman's decision that the question was out of order, and overwhelmingly voted that the "land, air, and water" plank and a plank explicitly supporting women's suffrage should be considered "part of the platform". Finally, at 6:00 a.m., Weaver arrived. To thunderous applause, the nominee thanked the convention for its decision and accepted the nomination. At 6:45 a.m., the exhausted delegates adjourned.

Three weeks later, Weaver published his formal letter of acceptance, calling for all party members to "go forth in the great struggle for human rights". In a departure from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. Chambers's own participation was limited, as before reaching home from the convention, he fell and broke two ribs as he exited his train. He was confined to bed for several weeks and considered withdrawing from the race, but decided against it; his efforts were limited by his injuries, and his only contribution to the campaign was to publish his newspaper.

As the campaign progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing <a href="Disenfranchisement%20after%20the%20Reconstruction%20Era">black disenfranchisement</a>. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.

The Greenback ticket received 305,997 votes and no electoral votes, compared to 4,446,158 for the winner, Republican James A. Garfield, and 4,444,260 for Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock. The party was strongest in the West and South, but in no state did Weaver receive more than 12% of the vote, and his nationwide total was just 3%. That figure represented an improvement over the Greenback vote of 1876, but to Weaver, who expected twice as many votes as he received, it was a disappointment.

Adelaide Anne Procter

Adelaide Anne Procter (30 October 1825 – 2 February 1864) was an English poet and <a href="philanthropist">philanthropist</a>. She worked prominently on behalf of unemployed women and the homeless, and was actively involved with <a href="feminist">feminist</a> groups and journals. Procter never married. She became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> at the age of 38.

Procter's literary career began when she was a teenager; her poems were primarily published in <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>'s periodicals "<a href="Household%20Words">Household Words</a>" and "<a href="All%20the%20Year%20Round">All the Year Round</a>" and later published in book form. Her charity work and her conversion to <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> appear to have strongly influenced her poetry, which deals most commonly with such subjects as homelessness, poverty, and <a href="fallen%20woman">fallen women</a>.

Procter was the favourite poet of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Her poetry went through numerous editions in the 19th century; <a href="Coventry%20Patmore">Coventry Patmore</a> called her the most popular poet of the day, after <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>. Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and were published in the United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part for what it reveals about how <a href="Women%20in%20the%20Victorian%20era">Victorian women</a> expressed otherwise repressed feelings.

Adelaide Anne Procter was born at 25 <a href="Bedford%20Square">Bedford Square</a> in the <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> district of London, on 30 October 1825 to the poet <a href="Bryan%20Procter">Bryan Waller Procter</a> and his wife Anne ("née" Skepper). The family had strong literary ties: novelist <a href="Elizabeth%20Gaskell">Elizabeth Gaskell</a> enjoyed her visits to the Procter household, and Procter's father was friends with poet <a href="Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a>, essayist <a href="Charles%20Lamb">Charles Lamb</a>, and novelist <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, as well as being acquainted with poet <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> and critic <a href="William%20Hazlitt">William Hazlitt</a>. Family friend <a href="Bessie%20Rayner%20Parkes">Bessie Rayner Belloc</a> wrote in 1895 that "everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow in and out of the house. The Kembles, the Macreadys, the Rossettis, the Dickens , the Thackerays, never seemed to be exactly visitors, but to belong to the place." Author and actress <a href="Fanny%20Kemble">Fanny Kemble</a> wrote that young Procter "looks like a poet's child, and a poet ... [with] a preter-naturally thoughtful, mournful expression for such a little child".

Dickens spoke highly of Procter's quick intelligence. By his account, the young Procter mastered without difficulty the subjects to which she turned her attention:

When she was quite a young child, she learnt with facility several of the problems of <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>. As she grew older, she acquired the French, Italian, and German languages ... piano-forte ... [and] drawing. But, as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study, it was her way to lose interest in it, and pass to another.

A voracious reader, Procter was largely self-taught, though she studied at <a href="Queen%27s%20College%2C%20London">Queen's College</a> in Harley Street in 1850. The college had been founded in 1848 by <a href="Frederick%20Denison%20Maurice">Frederick Maurice</a>, a <a href="Christian%20Socialist">Christian Socialist</a>; the faculty included novelist <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>, composer <a href="John%20Hullah">John Hullah</a>, and writer <a href="Henry%20Morley">Henry Morley</a>.
Procter showed a love of poetry from an early age, carrying with her while still a young child a "tiny album ... into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother's hand before she herself could write ... as another little girl might have carried a doll". Procter published her first poem while still a teenager; the poem, "Ministering Angels", appeared in "Heath's Book of Beauty" in 1843. In 1853 she submitted work to Dickens's "<a href="Household%20Words">Household Words</a>" under the name "Mary Berwick", wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to Dickens's friendship with her father; Dickens did not learn "Berwick's" identity till the following year. The poem's publication began Procter's long association with Dickens's periodicals; in all, Procter published 73 poems in "Household Words" and 7 poems in "<a href="All%20the%20Year%20Round">All the Year Round</a>", most of which were collected into her first two volumes of poetry, both entitled "Legends and Lyrics". She was also published in "Good Words" and "Cornhill." As well as writing poetry, Procter was the editor of the journal "Victoria Regia", which became the showpiece of the <a href="Victoria%20Press">Victoria Press</a>, "an explicitly feminist publishing venture".

In 1851, Procter converted to <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>. Following her conversion, Procter became extremely active in several charitable and feminist causes. She became a member of the <a href="History%20of%20feminism%23The%20ladies%20of%20Langham%20Place">Langham Place Group</a>, which set out to improve conditions for women, and was friends with <a href="feminist">feminist</a>s <a href="Bessie%20Rayner%20Parkes">Bessie Rayner Parkes</a> (later Bessie Rayner Belloc) and <a href="Barbara%20Bodichon">Barbara Leigh Smith</a>, later Barbara Bodichon. Procter helped found the "<a href="English%20Woman%27s%20Journal">English Woman's Journal</a>" in 1858 and, in 1859, the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women, both of which focused on expanding women's economic and employment opportunities. Though on paper Procter was merely one member among many, fellow-member <a href="Jessie%20Boucherett">Jessie Boucherett</a> considered her to be the "animating spirit" of the Society. Her third volume of poetry, "A Chaplet of Verses" (1861), was published for the benefit of a Catholic Night Refuge for Women and Children that had been founded in 1860 at Providence Row in <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East London</a>.

Procter became engaged in 1858, according to a letter that her friend <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a> wrote to his daughters that year. The identity of Procter's fiancé remains unknown, and the proposed marriage never took place. According to her German biographer Ferdinand Janku, the engagement seems to have lasted several years before being broken off by Procter's fiancé. Critic Gill Gregory suggests that Procter may have been a <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> and in love with <a href="Matilda%20Hays">Matilda Hays</a>, a fellow member of the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women; other critics have called Procter's relationship with Hays "emotionally intense." Procter's first volume of poetry, "Legends and Lyrics" (1858) was dedicated to Hays and that same year Procter wrote a poem titled "To M.M.H." in which Procter "expresses love for Hays ... [Hays was a] novelist and translator of <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand</a> and a controversial figure ... [who] dressed in men's clothes and had lived with the sculptor <a href="Harriet%20Hosmer">Harriet Hosmer</a> in Rome earlier in the 1850s." While several men showed interest in her, Procter never married.

Procter fell ill in 1862; Dickens and others have suggested that her illness was due to her extensive charity work, which "appears to have unduly taxed her strength". An attempt to improve her health by taking a <a href="Water%20cure%20%28therapy%29">cure</a> at <a href="Malvern%2C%20Worcestershire">Malvern</a> failed. On 3 February 1864, Procter died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, having been bed-ridden for almost a year. Her death was described in the press as a "national calamity". Procter was buried in <a href="Kensal%20Green%20Cemetery">Kensal Green Cemetery</a>.

Procter's poetry was strongly influenced by her religious beliefs and charity work; homelessness, poverty, and <a href="fallen%20women">fallen women</a> are frequent themes. Procter's prefaces to her volumes of poetry stress the misery of the conditions under which the poor lived, as do poems such as "The Homeless Poor":

In that very street, at that same hour,
In the bitter air and drifting sleet,
Crouching in a doorway was a mother,
With her children shuddering at her feet.

She was silent – who would hear her pleading?
Men and beasts were housed – but she must stay
Houseless in the great and pitiless city,
Till the dawning of the winter day. (51–58)

Procter's Catholicism also influenced her choice of images and symbols; Procter often uses references to the Virgin Mary, for example, to "introduce secular and Protestant readers to the possibility that a heavenly order critiques Victorian gender ideology's power structure."

Procter wrote several poems about war (the majority of poems published on this topic in "Household Words" were by Procter), although she rarely deals directly with the topic, preferring to leave war "in the background, something to be inferred rather than stated." Generally, these poems portray conflict as something "that might unite a nation that had been divided by class distinctions."

According to critic Gill Gregory, Procter "does not overtly ponder the vexed question of the poet, particularly the woman poet and her accession to fame", unlike many other women poets of the time, such as <a href="Felicia%20Hemans">Felicia Hemans</a> and <a href="Letitia%20Elizabeth%20Landon">Letitia Elizabeth Landon</a>. Procter is instead primarily concerned with the working classes, particularly working-class women, and with "emotions of women antagonists which have not fully found expression". Procter's work often embodies a Victorian aesthetic of sentimentality, but, according to Francis O'Gorman, does so with "peculiar strength"; Procter employs emotional affect without simplification, holding "emotional energy [in tension] ... against complications and nuances." Procter's language is simple; she expressed to a friend a "morbid terror of being misunderstood and misinterpreted", and her poetry is marked by "simplicity, directness, and clarity of expression".

Procter was "fabulously popular" in the mid-19th century; she was <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s favourite poet and <a href="Coventry%20Patmore">Coventry Patmore</a> stated that the demand for her work was greater than that for any other poet, excepting <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>. Readers valued Procter's poems for their plainness of expression, although they were considered "not so very original in thought; [their merit is that] they are indeed the utterances 'of a believing heart', pouring out its fulness." Procter herself expressed little ambition about her work: her friend Bessie Raynor Belloc thought that Procter was pained that her reputation as a poet had outstripped her father's, and quoted Procter as saying that "Papa is a poet. I only write verses."

Procter's popularity continued after her death; the first volume of "Legends and Lyrics" went through 19 editions by 1881, and the second through 14 editions by the same year. Many of her poems were made into hymns or otherwise set to music. Among these was "<a href="The%20Lost%20Chord">The Lost Chord</a>", which <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> set to music in 1877; this song was the most commercially successful of the 1870s and 1880s in both Britain and the United States. Her work was also published in the United States and translated into German. By 1938, Procter's reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them "stupid, trivial and not worthy of the subject". Critics such as Cheri Larsen Hoeckley, Kathleen Hickok, and Natalie Joy Woodall argue that the demise of Procter's reputation is due at least in part to the way Charles Dickens characterized her as a "model middle-class domestic angel" and a "fragile and modest saint" rather than as an "active feminist and strong poet." Emma Mason argues that although Dickens's portrayal of Procter "extinguished modern interest" in her, it also "has helped rescue Procter from the kind of endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like <a href="Letitia%20Elizabeth%20Landon">Letitia Landon</a>."

Modern critics have given Procter's work little attention. The few critics who have examined Procter's poetry generally find it important for the way that she overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them. According to <a href="Isobel%20Armstrong">Isobel Armstrong</a>, Procter's poetry, like that of many 19th-century women poets, employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety. Francis O'Gorman cites "A Legend of Provence" as an example of a poem with this kind of "double relationship with the structures of gender politics it seems to affirm." Other critics since Armstrong agree that Procter's poetry, while ladylike on the surface, shows signs of repressed emotions and desires. Kirstie Blair states that the suppression of emotion in Procter's work makes the narrative poems all the more powerful, and Gill Gregory argues that Procter's poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way, while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires. Elizabeth Gray criticizes the fact that the few discussions of Procter's poetry that do exist focus primarily on gender, arguing that the "range and formal inventiveness of this illuminatingly representative Victorian poet have remained largely unexplored."

Nativity (Christus)

The Nativity is a devotional mid-1450s oil-on-wood panel painting by the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Petrus%20Christus">Petrus Christus</a>. It shows a <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus%20in%20art">nativity scene</a> with <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> archways and "<a href="trompe-l%27%C5%93il">trompe-l'œil</a>" sculptured reliefs. Christus was influenced by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, especially <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> and <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, and the panel is characteristic of the simplicity and naturalism of art of that period. Placing archways as a framing device is a typical van der Weyden device, and here likely borrowed from that artist's "<a href="Altar%20of%20Saint%20John">Altar of Saint John</a>" and "<a href="Miraflores%20Altarpiece">Miraflores Altarpiece</a>". Yet Christus adapts these painterly motifs to a uniquely mid-15th century sensibility, and the unusually large panel – perhaps painted as a central altarpiece panel for a <a href="triptych">triptych</a> – is nuanced and visually complex. It shows his usual harmonious composition and employment of <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">one-point-perspective</a>, especially evident in the geometric forms of the shed's roof, and his bold use of color. It is one of Christus's most important works. <a href="Max%20Jakob%20Friedl%C3%A4nder">Max Friedländer</a> definitely attributed the panel to Christus in 1930, concluding that "in scope and importance, [it] is superior to all other known creations of this master."

The overall atmosphere is one of simplicity, serenity and understated sophistication. It is reflective of the 14th-century "<a href="Devotio%20Moderna">Devotio Moderna</a>" movement, and contains complex Christian symbolism, subtly juxtaposing <a href="Old%20Testament">Old</a> and <a href="New%20Testament">New</a> Testament iconography. The sculpted figures in the archway depict biblical scenes of sin and punishment, signaling the advent of <a href="Jesus">Christ</a>'s sacrifice, with an over-reaching message of the "Fall and Redemption of humankind". Inside the archway, surrounded by four angels, is the <a href="Holy%20Family">Holy Family</a>; beyond, a landscape extends into the far background.

Art historians have suggested completion dates ranging from the early 1440s to the early 1460s, with c. 1455 seen as probable. The panel was acquired by <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a> in the 1930s, and was one of several hundreds from his personal collection donated to the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington. It has suffered damage and was restored in the early 1990s for an exhibition at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.

The panel measures 127.6 cm × 94.9 cm (50.2 in × 37.4 in), unusually large for a 15th-century <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20Painting">Early Netherlandish</a> single-panel painting. It covers four oak boards. Although there is no evidence of missing wing panels, its size suggests it was a central altarpiece of a large <a href="triptych">triptych</a>. Art historian Joel Upton writes that with its size, style, tone and composition, Christus painted "an "<a href="Andachtsbilder">Andachtsbild</a>", given monumental, ciboriumlike dimensions". The distinction between the figures and the space around them is characteristic of Christus, as is its <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29%23One-point%20perspective">one-point perspective</a>. The background landscape is typically serene, as are what Upton describes as the "charming, almost doll-like figures who make up the cast of characters."

The panel is set in a shed enclosed by two pillars and an archway, rendered in sculpture-like <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a>. Each pillar is supported by a relief hunched figure ("<a href="Atlas%20%28architecture%29">atlante</a>") at the base, holding the weight on its shoulders. On each pillar stand statues of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve</a> – Adam on the left and Eve to the right. A marble threshold connects the two structures. On the top corners of the arch are two <a href="spandrels">spandrels</a>; the <a href="archivolt">archivolt</a>s contain six biblical scenes in relief from the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>, depicting the <a href="Fall%20of%20Man">Fall of Man</a>. Two are of Adam and Eve; their <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve%23Expulsion%20from%20Eden">expulsion from paradise</a> and Adam tilling the soil. The others are of <a href="Cain%20and%20Abel">Cain and Abel</a>: their sacrifice to God; Cain slaying Abel; God appearing to Abel; Cain expelled to the <a href="Land%20of%20Nod">Land of Nod</a>.

In the shed <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary</a> and <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Joseph</a> share an intensely private moment before the <a href="Annunciation%20to%20the%20shepherds">Annunciation to the shepherds</a> of the <a href="Child%20Jesus">Christ child</a>'s birth to the shepherds. They are rendered in bright colors. Mary wears a long flowing blue robe, Joseph a green-lined red cape over a brown robe. He holds his hat in hand, and his <a href="Patten%20%28shoe%29">pattens</a> are respectfully removed, left lying on the ground. They gaze reverently at the newborn figure of Jesus who lies on Mary's robe. Mary's features have a softness and sweetness more characteristic of Christus's later paintings and remarkably similar to his "<a href="Madonna%20of%20the%20Dry%20Tree">Madonna of the Dry Tree</a>", according to <a href="Maryan%20Ainsworth">Maryan Ainsworth</a>. Kneeling in adoration to either side are four small angels.
Animals are visible in stalls. Behind them is a crumbling wall with three low <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned to the left and two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and <a href="Passion%20%28Christianity%29">Christ's Passion</a>. The large domed building is based on the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">Holy Sepulcher</a> in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.

Light shines into the shed from outside through the low windows. The shadows cast suggest the dawn of a new day. The four onlookers in the rear are in light and shadow, especially noticeable on the face of the man second from the right. Here Christus borrows an optical device from the work of his predecessors <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> and <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, but is bolder and more accomplished with his use of light, which art professor Lola Gellman describes as having "no counterpoint in previous art."

The panel is rich in Christian iconography, which reflects the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the "<a href="Devotio%20Moderna">Devotio Moderna</a>" movement. The painting is devotional; its <a href="iconography">iconography</a> clearly juxtaposes <a href="Old%20Testament">Old</a> and <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ.

Depictions of the Nativity changed significantly in European art following <a href="Bridget%20of%20Sweden">St Bridget</a>'s visions of the event. According to Upton, the scene "became a source of emotional reward for one's faith, a private vision in response to one's contemplation." In Bridget's version of the event, Mary does not lie in a bed while giving birth. The event occurs in a cave, where, dressed in white, Mary kneels or stands in devotion before the infant lying on the ground. Joseph holds a candle to illuminate the birth. <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>'s c. 1420 "<a href="Nativity%20%28Campin%29">Nativity</a>" is representative of Bridget's narrative; the cave has been substituted by a shed with animals, Mary's handmaidens are present, while angels and shepherds rejoice. Christus simplified the narrative: removing the handmaidens and relegating the animals to the background. Mary's white dress is replaced with a deep-blue robe. His "Nativity" is somber and subdued, an embodiment of the "austere calm of timeless worship."
The "Nativity" conveys both the Old Testament themes of sin and punishment and the New Testament doctrine of sacrifice and redemption. Although Adam and Eve to either side of the arch are suggestive of those in van Eyck's "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>", they differ significantly. Here they are painted as grisaille statues in contrast to van Eyck's lifelike versions; and, unlike van Eyck's, here Adam and Eve stand in shame hiding their nudity. Earthly sin and strife, anger and revenge, are represented in the warriors in the corner spandrels, and signify that which Christ's birth would bring to an end.

Themes of punishment and redemption are further explored in the six scenes on the arch, where the reliefs show the events from (from left to right): The angel of God expelling Adam and Eve from the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a>; post-Expulsion life "when Adam delved and Eve spun"; the sacrifices of Cain and Abel; Cain killing Abel; (top) God banishing Cain; Cain saying farewell to his parents, or possibly his brother <a href="Seth">Seth</a> leaving to find the <a href="Tree%20of%20Life">Tree of Life</a>, a Jewish legend from "<a href="Life%20of%20Adam%20and%20Eve">The Apocalypse of Moses</a>", a <a href="Pseudepigrapha">pseudepigraphical</a> work from antiquity.

The two uppermost reliefs on the arch, which have a central focus and function as <a href="Keystone%20%28architecture%29">keystones</a>, bring attention to the juxtaposition of Old and New Testament themes. The relief to the left shows Cain and Abel sacrificing to God; on the right Cain commits the sin of murder, which God punishes. The two reliefs also function as a temporal device, leading the viewer directly to the moment of Christ's birth and mankind's redemption, which occurs below in the shed. The viewer is reminded that mankind must sacrifice to Christ, who lies directly below, or risk punishment and expulsion from the church, just as God expelled Cain. The Fall of man acted out on the archway reminds the viewer of the "necessity of Christ's sacrifice".

The semicircle of rock inside the doorsill remind the viewer to abandon sin. The viewer is reminded to reach a full understanding of the significance of the event, achieved with the two groupings of shepherds at the rear of the shed. Two of the four are active and two are passive. The man dressed in blue on the left is listening; the man in blue to the right is seeing, while their counterparts in red do neither. Although actively looking and listening, the two men in blue do not appear to have a full understanding of the event. Upton explains the medieval viewer would have understood that in the iconography Christus presented "man who would listen without hearing, and look without seeing." The viewer is reminded to comprehend the painting's vision and iconography, to fully recognize the significance of Christ's coming, to hear and see the word of God, and to obey God's wishes.

The tuft of grass sprouting from the roof's central truss above the figures conveys multiple meanings. Although the shrub is naturally rendered, Christus almost certainly placed it there for its symbolic value; its positioning suggests he followed a program of disguised iconography. The most obvious meaning is of new life and new beginnings. On a secular level, the shrub may have indicated Christus's membership in the Confraternity of the Dry Tree, which he joined sometime around 1462–63. The confraternity was prestigious, including among its ranks <a href="House%20of%20Valois-Burgundy">Burgundian</a> nobility, such as <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a> and his wife <a href="Isabella%20of%20Portugal%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Burgundy">Isabella</a>, wealthy foreign merchants and members from Bruges's upper classes. The tuft of grass also symbolizes the <a href="Tree%20of%20life%20%28biblical%29">tree of life</a>, and Upton theorizes that by placing it there, Christus "has given expression to the legend" of Adam's third son, Seth, whose quest for a branch was a popular legend in the medieval period. Furthermore, alludes to <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and the <a href="burning%20bush">burning bush</a>. According to Upton, in Christus's "Nativity" Joseph assumes Moses's role of protector and law-bringer; just as Joseph has removed his <a href="Patten%20%28shoe%29">patten</a>s in the presence of Christ, Moses removed his shoes in the presence of the bush.

The setting represents the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> – the angels are clothed in <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>ic <a href="vestments">vestments</a>, with those on the far right dressed in a deacon's <a href="cope">cope</a>. None wear the celebrant's <a href="chasuble">chasuble</a>, suggesting Christ is the priest. The shed roof is a <a href="Ciborium%20%28architecture%29">ciborium</a> over an altar. A later addition to the painting, added perhaps in the 17th century, and since removed, was a gold <a href="paten">paten</a> on which the infant lay, clearly showing Jesus as the Eucharistic <a href="Sacramental%20bread">host</a>. Mary, Joseph and the angels are the first to worship the infant Christ and the shed "becomes the altar of the first mass". Upton explains that when viewed in the context of the first mass the iconography is more clearly defined.

Christus was the first Netherlandish painter to achieve proficiency in strict mathematical compositional rules with his use of <a href="Orthogonality">orthogonals</a>, creating a unified perspective. The concept of compositions "based on unitary perspective" was largely a pioneering effort on Christus's part, although he borrowed from the earlier masters. Compositionally, the "Nativity" is one of Christus's most complex and important works, which Ainsworth says is masterfully integrated with the use of color. X-radiography reveals sketched orthogonal lines on the <a href="underpainting">underpainting</a>, used to indicate where the horizontal and vertical axis should meet at the main figures' heads, and that he used a compass to sketch the spandrels.

The painting contains several geometric constructions. The roof of the shed's <a href="truss">truss</a>es form series of triangles connecting lines joining the base of the pedestals and the crossbeams. These surround the gathering of the <a href="Holy%20Family">Holy Family</a>, who form an inverse pattern. According to art historian Lawrence Steefel, "the detail participates in an almost emblematic pattern of repeated triangles which establish a rhyme scheme above and below, of roof structure and figure disposition." Upton writes that a "clearly defined diamond" is visible within the apex in the roof. From there it extends down to Eve, and the bottom apex is formed where the infant lies on the ground. It then extends up to Adam and back up to the roof. "This diamond shape," he writes, "supplemented by the rectangle within it, formed by the shed supports, the base of the triangle and the ground line in the shed, circumscribes the main event of the painting."
Spatial and temporal borders separating the earthly and heavenly spheres are often seen in Netherlandish art, usually in the form of frames or arches. A boundary is achieved here with the grisaille archway, strongly reminiscent of van der Weyden's work. Art historians speculate Christus may have imitated his c. 1455 "". Instead of merely imitating, Christus innovated and extended the use of van der Weyden's arch motif; his arch is meant to be an opening, or a screen, for the viewer to see into the holy space, instead of a simple framing device in which figures are placed directly in-line or under the arch. The multi-hued threshold stones at the bottom emphasize its function says Upton, who writes: "it is an opening through which one passes: a true frame or doorway to the picture ... Yet, since this arch is painted in grisaille, distinct from the rest of the panel, it must also be seen as a separate entity, much like an elaborate border around an illuminated manuscript page." The shadows cast by the grisaille figures stress "its function as a diaphragm between real and illusory space".
A very similar archway is found in <a href="Dieric%20Bouts">Dieric Bouts</a>'s c. 1445 "<a href="Triptych%20of%20the%20Virgin%27s%20Life%20%28Bouts%29">Mary Altarpiece</a>", including spandrels with warriors. Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier – Christus's "Nativity" or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed at roughly the same period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of scenes with separate archways.

The arch is only a prelude to the complex divisions beyond. The space inhabited by the Holy Family is holy ground. Mary, Joseph, the Christ child and the four surrounding angels occupy a space partitioned in the front by the archway and by the wall at the rear. A semicircle of figures is positioned around Christ, echoed in the semicircle of rocks placed directly inside the doorsill. Mary and Joseph are echoed by the colorful vertical <a href="Porphyry%20%28geology%29">porphyry</a> columns on the sides, and by the statues of Adam and Eve. The rear of the shed where the four men stand, the small valley with the shepherds, the town, and the background landscape are also spatially discrete areas, which create a "steady, measured movement into space in place of the more abrupt jumping from foreground to distant background common to Flemish painting." They also function to surround the Holy Family while simultaneously preventing its isolation from the world. Ainsworth writes that the "message of the painting quietly emerges from the strict, perspectively correct space constructed to engage the viewer." Upton agrees, explaining that the use of geometric devices emphasize the focal point, which "falls well below the horizon in the exact center of the panel", a perspective that would have given the 15th center viewer, kneeling in front of the panel, a "sense of physical relationship between the actual and ideal act of worship."

The "Nativity"'s dating has long been a source of debate among scholars. Estimations range from the mid-1440s to the mid-1450s; early in Christus's career to about the time van der Weyden painted his c. 1455 "Altar of St John". Generally the mid-1450s seems the most accepted. Ainsworth considers it, along with Christus's "Holy Family" (currently in <a href="Kansas%20City">Kansas City</a>), one of the most important attributed to him and believes it belongs in his later oeuvre, possibly as late as the mid-1460s. Evidence such as when Christus joined the Confraternity of the Dry Tree (c. early 1460s) points to it as a later work along with the "<a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Young%20Girl%20%28Christus%29">Portrait of a Young Girl</a>". Its use of perspective and assimilation of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's earlier influences also suggest a later date. Furthermore, the softer facial types utilized in the "Nativity" are typical of Christus's later work, and suggest a date around the mid-1450s. Technical analysis (<a href="Dendrochronology">dendrochronological</a> evidence) suggests a date of c. 1458, based on the tree felling date. Christus painted two other versions of the Nativity: one in Bruges and the other in Berlin. The Bruges "Nativity" is dated 1452 – whether the date was added by Christus or during a restoration is unknown – and technical analysis of the brushstrokes suggests it to be earlier than the Washington "Nativity".
Determining the execution date relies on stylistic analysis, and the degree of van der Weyden's influence. The dating of the work to the 1440s is based on the notion that Christus borrowed heavily from the immediate influence of van der Weyden and Bouts. Although some of the similarities are undeniably striking and might be attributed to following a template, the degree of sophistication in the "Nativity" far surpasses the other two painters, according to Ainsworth. She writes that Bouts and van der Weyden "merely expand the narrative" in their use of the archway motif, whereas Christus shows a strong cause and effect between sin and redemption, innovations which almost certainly evolved later in his career, placing the date no earlier than the mid-1450s.
The <a href="underdrawing">underdrawing</a> is visible through modern technical analysis, revealing the main group of figures and contour lines in the folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, probably because of later overpainting. In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends far to the left of the angel, but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution.

The work has suffered damage: cracking where three wood panels are joined, paint loss to parts of the <a href="Craquelure">crackle</a> pattern, and discoloration of varnishes. The largest area of paint loss occurred on Joseph's shoulder. Mary's robe has been completely restored and overpainted. Some paint loss is barely discernible in the areas around her hair. In many areas the paint layers and underlying support are in good condition.

The "Nativity" was one of 13 works hung at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s 1994 exhibition, "Petrus Christus: Renaissance Master of Bruges". It underwent significant restoration in preparation. Technicians removed over-paint probably dating to its Spanish provenance. The addition included the gold paten on Mary's robe, pigment under the Christ child, and the halos above Mary and Jesus. As early as 1916, Friedländer questioned the presence of halos in Christus's work, rarely seen in mid-15th century Netherlandish painting. When the halos were carefully examined they were found to be later additions; before the exhibition they were removed from several paintings, including the "<a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Carthusian">Portrait of a Carthusian</a>".

The painting is today in the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., which was conceived by Pittsburgh financier <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a> in the late 1930s. It was one of 126 paintings from his personal collection donated to the gallery and was on display at the museum opening in March 1941 – three years after his death.

It belonged to Señora O. Yturbe of Madrid, who sold it in 1930 to Franz M. Zatzenstein, founder of the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin. That April, the <a href="Joseph%20Duveen%2C%201st%20Baron%20Duveen">Duveen Brothers</a>, less affected by the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">1929 stock market crash</a> than other dealers, paid Zatzenstein £30,000, in cash, for the painting and sold it immediately to Mellon. A dealer usually had to go through the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans-Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply; the transaction for the "Nativity" is exceptional because it is the first painting of which the photograph was wired via <a href="Marconi%20Company">Marconi</a> cable from England to America. To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route – from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America. In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and gifted to the National Gallery a year later.

Given its size and orientation, the panel was probably meant to stand alone, but may have been conceived as the wing of triptych altarpiece. Who commissioned the piece or how it came to be in the possession of a Spanish owner is unknown. At least half of Christus's known patrons were Italian or Spanish, and he often changed his style to suit their desire. Around eight of his paintings – only about 25 are extant – have come from either Italy or Spain, giving credence to speculation that he spent time there. Yet the existence of the thriving export market in early Netherlandish panel painting suggests equally that it could have been painted in Bruges and transported south.
