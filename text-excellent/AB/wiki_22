1966 New York City smog

The 1966 New York City smog was a major air-pollution episode, during which the city's air reached damaging levels of several toxic pollutants. <a href="Smog">Smog</a> covered the area from November23 to 26, coinciding with that year's <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a> holiday weekend. It was the third major smog in New York City, following events of similar scale in 1953 and 1963.

On November 23, a large mass of stagnant air over the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> trapped pollutants in the city's air. For three days, New York City was engulfed in high levels of <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>, smoke, and haze. Pockets of air pollution pervaded the greater <a href="New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">New York metropolitan area</a>, including parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. By November 25, regional leaders announced a "first-stage alert". During the alert, leaders of local and state governments asked residents and industry to take voluntary steps to minimize emissions. Health officials advised people with respiratory or heart conditions to remain indoors. The city shut off garbage incinerators, requiring massive hauling of garbage to landfills. A <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a> dispersed the smog on November 26 and the alert ended.

In the months that followed, medical researchers studied the smog's impact on health. City officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths, but it soon became clear that the smog had been a major <a href="environmental%20disaster">environmental disaster</a> with severe <a href="public%20health">public health</a> effects. A December 1966 study estimated that 10% of the city's population had suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, <a href="cough">cough</a>ing, and <a href="respiratory%20distress">respiratory distress</a>. A statistical analysis published in October 1967 found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog.

The smog catalyzed greater national awareness of air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its <a href="New%20York%20City%20Administrative%20Code">local laws</a> on air-pollution control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B. Johnson and members of Congress worked to pass federal legislation regulating air pollution in the United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 <a href="Clean%20Air%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Clean Air Act</a>. The 1966 smog was a milestone event and has served as a benchmark for comparison with subsequent pollution events, including the <a href="Health%20effects%20arising%20from%20the%20September%2011%20attacks">health effects of pollution from the September 11 attacks</a> and incidents of <a href="pollution%20in%20China">pollution in China</a>.

The word "<a href="smog">smog</a>" (a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "<a href="smoke">smoke</a>" and "<a href="fog">fog</a>") is used to describe several forms of <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a> commonly found in urban and industrialized areas. There are several ways to define and categorize types of smog, with some sources defining two main types of smog: smoky "London <a href="Pea%20soup%20fog">Pea soup</a>"-style smog and hazy "Los Angeles"-style smog.

London smog and Los Angeles smog are not exclusive to their namesake cities, and are found in urban areas throughout the world. Additionally, both types of smog are commonly found together in the same region. At the time of the 1966 smog and in the two decades prior, air pollution in New York City combined the characteristics of London smog and Los Angeles smog: the city's smog in that period was caused by both stationary sources such as industrial coal-burning and mobile sources such as motor vehicles.

Although smog is a chronic condition, unfavorable weather conditions and excessive pollutants can cause intense concentrations of smog that can cause acute illness and death; because of their unusual visibility and lethality, these intense smog events have often been publicized in the media and are typically described as <a href="disaster">disaster</a>s or, more specifically, <a href="environmental%20disaster">environmental disaster</a>s. An acute "smog event" may also be called simply "a smog", a smog "episode", or a "killer smog" (if it caused, or had the potential to cause, deaths).

Even before the 1966 smog episode in New York City, it was known by scientists, city officials, and the general public that the city—and most major American cities—had serious air-pollution problems. According to scientific studies from the period, more than 60 <a href="List%20of%20primary%20statistical%20areas%20of%20the%20United%20States">metropolitan areas</a> had "extremely serious air pollution problems" and "probably no American city of more than [50,000] inhabitants enjoys clean air the year round". The air "over much of the eastern half of the country [was] chronically polluted," and the cities with the most intense air pollution were New York City, <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, and <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>.

New York City's air pollution was reportedly the worst of any American city. Although the "persistently glaring" photochemical smog of Los Angeles was more visible, more "infamous," and received a greater degree of public attention, New York City had more total emissions and many more emissions proportional to its area. Despite its higher emissions, New York City's landscape and weather normally prevented smog from concentrating at high levels, meaning the smog was mostly invisible most of the time. Unlike Los Angeles, which is surrounded by mountains that tend to trap airborne pollutants, New York City's open <a href="topography">topography</a> and favorable wind conditions usually dispersed pollutants before they could form concentrated smog. If 1960s New York City had surroundings and a climate like those of Los Angeles, pollutants would not have escaped as easily and smog would have made the city uninhabitable.

The smog event of 1966 was preceded by two other major smog episodes in New York City: one in November 1953, and one in January–February 1963. With the use of statistical analysis comparing the number of deaths during periods of smog with the number of deaths during the same time in other years, medical scientists led by Leonard Greenburg determined that <a href="mortality%20displacement">excess deaths</a> occurred during those smogs. From the observation of excess deaths, Greenburg inferred that the smog caused or contributed to those deaths. An estimated 220–240 deaths were caused by the six-day 1953 smog, and an estimated 300–405 deaths were caused by the two-week 1963 smog. Other minor episodes of smog occurred in the city prior to 1966, but were not accompanied by statistically significant excess deaths.

In 1953, the city opened a laboratory to monitor pollution that would become its Department of Air Pollution Control. At the time of the 1966 smog, air quality measurements were recorded from only a single station, the <a href="Harlem%20Courthouse">Harlem Courthouse</a> building on East 121st Street, run by Braverman and his staff of 15. Taking measurements from a single station meant that the index reflected conditions in the immediately surrounding area, but served as a crude, unrepresentative gauge of overall air quality across the entire city. The Interstate Sanitation Commission, a regional agency run by New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut and headquartered at <a href="Columbus%20Circle">Columbus Circle</a>, also relied on the Harlem Courthouse laboratory. Formed in 1936, the advisory agency was authorized in 1962 by New York and New Jersey to oversee air pollution issues.

The department quantified pollution using an <a href="air%20quality%20index">air quality index</a> (AQI), a single number based on combined measurements of several pollutants. <a href="air%20quality%20index%23United%20States">AQI measurements in the United States</a> are now standardized and overseen by the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">EPA</a>, but in the 1960s, local governments in different regions used "a confusing and scientifically inconsistent array of air quality reporting methods".

By 1964, the Department of Air Pollution Control had developed an AQI called the SCS Air Pollution Index (SCS API), combining measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO), <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> (CO), and <a href="coefficient%20of%20haze">coefficient of haze</a> (also called smoke shade) into a single number. The city laboratory recorded the presence of those three pollutants measured in amount (by <a href="concentration">concentration</a> in the air) and duration. SO and CO were measured by <a href="Parts-per%20notation">parts-per-million</a>, or ppm, and smoke shade was measured in mppcf (millions of particles per <a href="cubic%20foot">cubic foot</a>); the department continuously monitored these pollutant levels and recorded their hourly averages. The data for those three pollutants were combined into a single number using a <a href="Weight%20function">weighted</a> formula developed by department co-founder Moe Mordecai Braverman.

The index average was 12, with an "emergency" level if the index was higher than 50 for a 24-hour period. The average of 12 was determined from data collected between 1957 and 1964 showing average levels of 0.18 ppm SO, 3 ppm CO, and 2.7 mppcf smoke levels. The "emergency" level of 50 was announced in 1964. The index system used by the city in 1966 is not in use anywhere today and was unique to the city even at the time; the 1966 smog itself prompted scientists to reexamine and improve the city's methodology for recording air-pollutant levels.

Using the SCS API, the city adopted an air-pollution alert system with three stages of alert, matching increasingly severe levels of pollution with corresponding counteractions. The city announced its only first-stage alert in 1966; second- and third-stage alerts were never reached.

Braverman later admitted that the "emergency" alert level of 50 SCS API had been chosen on an essentially arbitrary basis:

Another defect of the SCS API alert system was that it relied on a balance of multiple pollutants but would disregard fatal levels of any one pollutant under certain conditions. Critics pointed out that the index could have allowed the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon monoxide without triggering any alert, so long as the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department had to contend with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, so the SCS API's flaws were accepted for lack of a better alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system if one had existed.

Dr. Helmut F. Landsberg, a <a href="Climatology">climate scientist</a> with the federal <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">Weather Bureau</a>, predicted in 1963 that the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeastern</a> and <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region">Great Lakes</a> regions could anticipate a major smog event every three years due to the confluence of weather events and trends like growing population, <a href="Industrialisation">industrialization</a>, and increased emissions from cars and <a href="central%20heating">central heating</a>. In early 1966, Dr. Walter Orr Roberts—director of the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Atmospheric%20Research">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a>—warned of the imminent threat of a smog event with the potential to kill as many as 10,000 people. Roberts identified Los Angeles or New York City as the cities most vulnerable to a large-scale lethal smog in the United States, and London, <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, or <a href="Santiago">Santiago</a> as other the most vulnerable internationally. Asked if "many" American cities were vulnerable to a disaster smog event, Roberts replied, "Yes. I have been worried that we would wake up some morning to an unusual meteorological situation that prevented the air from circulating and that we might find thousands of people dead as the result of the air they were forced to breathe in that smog situation."

The <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">mayor's office</a> established a 10-member task force headed by <a href="Norman%20Cousins">Norman Cousins</a> (known as the editor of the weekly magazine "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28U.S.%20magazine%29">Saturday Review</a>") to study the problem of air pollution. The task force published a 102-page report in May 1966, finding that the city had the most polluted air of any major city in the United States, with a wider range and greater total tonnage of pollutants than Los Angeles. The task force criticized the city for lax enforcement of pollution laws, even naming the city itself the biggest violator, with municipal garbage incinerators "operat[ing] in almost constant violation" of its own laws. The report warned "all the ingredients now exist for an air-pollution disaster of major proportions" and that the city "could become a <a href="gas%20chamber">gas chamber</a>" in the wrong weather conditions.

A July 1966 report by the <a href="New%20York%20Academy%20of%20Medicine">New York Academy of Medicine</a> Committee on Public Health cautioned that New York City's air-pollution problem made it susceptible to acute and lethal episodes and recommended a reduction of air pollution. Further, the report concluded that scientists had likely not identified the full range of harmful pollutants or health effects caused by air pollution.

The following charts show the daily <a href="Arithmetic%20mean">mean</a> values of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and smoke measurements in New York City from November19–30, 1966. The charts are adapted from .

In November 1966, New York City was experiencing an unseasonably warm "<a href="Indian%20summer">Indian summer</a>". A <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a> from Canada brought clean air to the city on November19, but the cold front was held in place by pressure from the higher atmosphere. An <a href="Anticyclone">anticyclonic</a> temperature <a href="Inversion%20%28meteorology%29">inversion</a>—in other words, a warm, mostly stationary <a href="air%20mass">air mass</a> located atop a cooler air mass—formed over the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> on November 20.

Unlike <a href="atmospheric%20convection">atmospheric convection</a>—the ordinary process of lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, but they are usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they have enough time to become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.

The inversion prevented air pollutants from rising, thereby trapping them within the city. The smog event itself started on Wednesday November 23, coinciding with the beginning of the long <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> weekend. The material sources of the smog were <a href="particulates">particulates</a> and chemicals from factories, chimneys, and vehicles. <a href="Sulfur%20dioxide">Sulfur dioxide</a> levels rose. <a href="Coefficient%20of%20haze">Smoke shade</a>, a measure of visibility interference in the atmosphere, was two to three times higher than usual.

The city chose not to declare a smog alert on Thanksgiving Day, but "The New York Times" later reported that city officials had been "on the verge" of calling an alert. Austin Heller, the city's commissioner of air pollution control, said he nearly declared a first-stage alert between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. on November 24. Heller said the index had reached a high of 60.6—10 points higher than the "emergency" mark—between 8 and 9 p.m., and the 60.6 reading was possibly the highest in the city's history. After a nighttime lull, Heller cautioned, the smog would likely spike again in the morning.

The unusually heavy smog was evident to the crowd of one million onlookers at the <a href="Macy%27s%20Thanksgiving%20Day%20Parade">Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>. Tabloids and newspapers that ordinarily ran front-page stories about the parade instead carried stories about the smog. Health officials cautioned those with chronic lung diseases to stay indoors and advised patients that symptoms of pollution-related illness usually lagged 24 hours after exposure.

That day, the city closed all 11 of its municipal garbage <a href="Incineration">incinerators</a>. Energy companies <a href="Consolidated%20Edison">Consolidated Edison</a> (called ConEd for short) and <a href="Long%20Island%20Lighting%20Company">Long Island Lighting Company</a> were asked to burn <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> rather than <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to minimize the release of sulfur dioxide; both companies voluntarily cut back emissions, with Con Ed reducing its emissions by 50 percent. The city told 18 inspectors "to forget their <a href="Thanksgiving%20dinner">turkey dinners</a> and start looking for dirty air," and they issued an "unusually high" number of <a href="Summons">citations</a> for emissions violations, including two for Con Ed plants. <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Representative</a> <a href="William%20Fitts%20Ryan">William Fitts Ryan</a> of Manhattan sent a telegram to <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Health%2C%20Education%20and%20Welfare">Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare</a> <a href="John%20W.%20Gardner">John W. Gardner</a> to request an emergency meeting with <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20York">New York Governor</a> <a href="Nelson%20Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a>, <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">New Jersey Governor</a> <a href="Richard%20J.%20Hughes">Richard J. Hughes</a>, and other regional leaders.

By Friday November 25, a first-stage alert for the <a href="New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">New York metropolitan area</a>, including parts of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> and <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, was declared through newspaper, radio, and television announcements. Governors Rockefeller and Heller attended a press conference with Deputy Mayor <a href="Robert%20Price%20%28attorney%29">Robert Price</a> standing in for Mayor Lindsay, who was on vacation in <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. The announcement "was believed to be the first appeal ever made to New York's citizens in connection with a smog problem". Conrad Simon, who acted as a liaison between the scientific and political communities during the crisis, later said "We came close to closing the city down."

Pollution was not as high in New Jersey or Connecticut as in New York, but it was still significant. New Jersey reported what was then its worst-ever smog. <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a> had smog at half the levels of New York City. A Connecticut health official reported air pollution four times higher than average, but the impact in <a href="Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut">Greenwich, Connecticut</a> was considered minimal. The nearby New York counties of <a href="Nassau%20County%2C%20New%20York">Nassau</a>, <a href="Suffolk%20County%2C%20New%20York">Suffolk</a>, and <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester</a> reported very little smog. Although not part of the area covered by the alert, unusually high smog was reported as far as <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, whose mayor issued a similar health warning.

The alert was declared upon the advice of the Interstate Sanitation Commission. Members of the commission had been monitoring the smog situation in shifts for three days, nonstop. Thomas R. Glenn Jr., the commission's director and chief engineer, recommended the alert at 11:25 a.m. after seeing instruments in New York and New Jersey that showed carbon monoxide greater than 10 ppm (<a href="Parts-per%20notation">parts-per-million</a>) and smoke greater than 7.5 ppm, both for more than four consecutive hours.

In New York, the city asked commuters to avoid driving unless necessary, and apartment buildings to stop incinerating their residents' garbage and turn heating down to 60 <a href="Fahrenheit">°F</a> (15 <a href="Celsius">°C</a>). New Jersey and Connecticut asked their residents not to travel, and to use less power and heat. Although it was a workday, traffic was light in New York City. A check on 303 buildings of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Housing%20Authority">New York City Housing Authority</a> later found near-total cooperation with the city's requests. Private residences were believed to have had a high rate of voluntary cooperation with the city's plea to cut energy consumption.

The weather forecast called for the heat inversion to end that day, followed by a cold wind that would disperse the smog. Nevertheless, Heller said that if the wind did not come, a first-stage alert would likely remain in effect and it might become necessary to declare a second-stage alert if conditions worsened.

Rain came in the night. The cold front that would blow away the smog was forecasted to arrive between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. Shortly after 9 a.m. the wind arrived, moving mostly from the northeast between 6–10 miles per hour and bringing cooler temperatures in the 50s °F (10–15 °C). Glenn at the Interstate Sanitation Commission sent a message advising the alert to end at 9:40 a.m., based on weather and air readings. Shortly after noon, Governor Rockefeller declared the end of the alert; New Jersey and Connecticut also ended their alerts that day.

Health effects from the smog were downplayed in most early reports. Some hospitals reported increased admissions of patients with <a href="asthma">asthma</a>. An official at the city <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Mental%20Hygiene">Department of Health</a> noted that some hospitals were receiving fewer asthma patients, and attributed the reported increases to ordinary random fluctuations. The official told "The New York Times" that "[i]n not one [hospital] is a pattern emerging which would suggest we are dealing with an important health hazard as of this moment." By this time, the inability to incinerate garbage had generated a large amount of excess waste. Hundreds of sanitation workers worked overtime to transport garbage to landfills in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, and <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>, with the bulk going to <a href="Fresh%20Kills%20Landfill">Fresh Kills</a> in Staten Island.

It was not initially clear to the medical community how many casualties and illnesses had been caused by the smog—or indeed, whether the smog had caused any casualties at all. The population of the area affected by the smog has been estimated at 16 million. A November26 story by <a href="Jane%20Brody">Jane Brody</a> in the "New York Times" cautioned that it would likely take "a month or more" before investigators had enough data to assess whether the smog had caused any deaths. Three days later, after studying admissions to municipal hospitals for cardiac and respiratory complications, the city commissioner of hospitals Joseph V. Terenzio told the press "I can report almost with certainty that there was no detectable immediate effect on morbidity and mortality because of the smog. ... It now seems unlikely that final statistical analysis will reveal any significant impact on the health of New York City's population." Early reports of injuries focused not on respiratory damage, but on car or boating accidents caused by poor visibility.

Nonfatal <a href="health%20effect">health effect</a>s were difficult to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on <a href="Old%20age">the elderly</a> population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including <a href="symptom">symptom</a>s like stinging eyes, <a href="cough">cough</a>ing, <a href="Wheeze">wheezing</a>, the <a href="Sputum">coughing-up of phlegm</a>, or <a href="Respiratory%20distress">difficulty breathing</a>. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated the existence of a serious <a href="public%20health">public health</a> problem.

The earliest report of casualties came in a special message by President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> sent to Congress on January30, 1967. In the message, the president said 80 people had died in the smog. Johnson did not cite a source for that claimed estimate of deaths, and there is no known source concluding that 80 people died other than those citing Johnson.

Two major medical studies have analyzed the extent of casualties from the smog. Leonard Greenburg—the same medical researcher who had previously published findings on the death count of the 1953 and 1963 smogs—published a paper in October 1967 showing that the previous year's smog had likely killed 168 people. Greenburg showed that there were 24 deaths in excess of how many would normally be expected at that time of year every day, over a period of seven days—using a period four days longer than the smog itself had lasted because of the delay between smog exposure and resultant health effects. Greenburg said that his analysis could not account for damage during the smog that would remain latent and continue to cause disease and death for years. The results of Greenburg's paper were reported by "The New York Times".

The smog was compared to the <a href="1948%20Donora%20smog">1948 smog</a> in <a href="Donora%2C%20Pennsylvania">Donora, Pennsylvania</a>, and the 1952 <a href="Great%20Smog%20of%20London">Great Smog of London</a>, both of which lasted five days. The London smog's death toll of 4,000 was far higher than Donora's, but the smog in Donora was far more severe; at the time of its smog, Donora was a small industrial town with a population of only 13,000 and its population was proportionally hit much harder than London's, with 20 deaths and smog-related illnesses among 43 percent of the population. Pollution experts estimated that if a smog event as powerful as Donora's had occurred in the much more populous New York City, the death toll could have been as high as 11,000 with four million ill.

Circumstantial factors helped to offset the smog's potential strength and health damage. The event began over the long Thanksgiving weekend, not the <a href="Workweek%20and%20weekend">workweek</a>, meaning that many factories were closed and far fewer people were in traffic than normally would be. The warm weather meant the demand for central heating was also lower than usual. On November25, the high of broke the previous record high for that date, leading the reporter <a href="Homer%20Bigart">Homer Bigart</a> to describe the apartment-heating restrictions as "no problem." Because of these factors, pollution—and the death toll—were likely lower than they could have been otherwise.

The smog brought into focus the complexity and interdependency of environmental problems and other issues of urban life. Attempts by city government to react to the smog had unintended negative side effects of their own; as Mayor Lindsay reflected in his 1969 book "The City", "[e]very time you shut down an incinerator, you increase the amount of garbage on city streets." Efforts to address a given environmental problem can cause undesired side effects, sometimes unforeseeable, which are often related to a city's limited resources.

Environmental harms in general are linked to <a href="urban%20decay">urban decay</a> and <a href="social%20inequality">social inequality</a>. After the 1966 smog, the task of eliminating or reducing air pollution became an essential part of the goal to make "the city attractive again to the middle class and acceptable to all its residents." Such harms—but especially those that create obvious and unpleasant effects, as smog does—were among the factors that, historically, motivated and exacerbated <a href="white%20flight">white flight</a> from American cities, including New York City, in the mid-20th century. The mass migration of affluent residents, whether individually motivated by unpleasant environmental factors like smog in whole or in part, drained the city's tax base and resulted in a <a href="Human%20capital%20flight">loss of human resources</a> for the city's economy. Residents who remained in the city often had no choice whether to stay or to leave because they lacked the resources that would enable them to move. Those residents then saw the burdens of pollution—including the direct effects of pollution itself, indirect effects of city reactions to pollution (for example, uncollected garbage in the streets), and other problems stemming from lack of municipal resources after white flight—as "emblems of larger governmental neglect and social inequality".

The smog is commonly cited as one of the most-visible and most-discussed environmental disasters of the 1960s in the United States, alongside the <a href="1969%20Santa%20Barbara%20oil%20spill">1969 Santa Barbara oil spill</a> and the 1969 <a href="Cuyahoga%20River">Cuyahoga River</a> fire. National public awareness of the smog and its health effects spurred the nascent <a href="environmental%20movement%20in%20the%20United%20States">environmental movement in the United States</a> and galvanized support for legislation to regulate air pollution. Vernon McKenzie, chief of the air pollution division of the federal <a href="United%20States%20Public%20Health%20Service">Public Health Service</a>, called the smog "a warning of what can happen—and will happen—with increasing frequency and in wider areas unless something is done to prevent it." In the 1968 book "Killer Smog", William Wise warned that the 1966 smog and the 1952 London smog represented a vulnerability to air pollution disasters among American cities:

At the time of the smog event, only half of the urban population of the United States lived with local protections on air quality; the smog event catalyzed the call for federal regulation on the issue. <a href="Spencer%20R.%20Weart">Spencer R. Weart</a> of the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Physics">American Institute of Physics</a> said the American public "did not take the problem [of air pollution] seriously" until the 1966 smog. According to Weart, an important factor driving awareness of the smog was its location, as events in New York "always had a disproportionate influence on the media headquartered there."

Before the 1966 smog, the city government had been slow to act to regulate air pollution. Despite general awareness of the health and environmental impacts of smog, other problems took priority: as "The New York Times" reported, issues like "housing, crime, education and keeping the city 'cool' were at the forefront of city government concerns." But the 1966 smog impelled a swift response by the city government, who now felt pressure to respond "in the aftermath of disaster." Lindsay, then a <a href="Modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal</a> <a href="Rockefeller%20Republican">Rockefeller Republican</a>, had run as a supporter of stronger air pollution control in his 1965 mayoral campaign, and the 1966 smog reinforced Lindsay's position on the issue.

<a href="New%20York%20City%20Council">City Council</a> member Robert A. Low, a Manhattan <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> and chairman of the city subcommittee on air pollution, criticized Lindsay for failing to enforce an air-pollution bill that had been passed in May. The bill, authored by Low, would update city incinerators and require apartment buildings to replace their incinerators with other garbage disposal methods. Low accused Lindsay's administration of "dragging its feet" on the problem of air pollution, which Lindsay called a "political attack."

The mayor's office prepared a report in the aftermath of the smog, singling out the coal-burning <a href="Consolidated%20Edison">Consolidated Edison</a> company, city buses, and apartment building incinerators as significant contributors to air pollution. The report noted that the change in weather that dispersed the smog "spared the city an unspeakable tragedy," and that if New York City had <a href="Los%20Angeles%23Environmental%20issues">stagnant smog at the high levels commonly found in Los Angeles</a>, "everyone in the city would have long since perished from the poisons in the air." Consolidated Edison began using a fuel with lower sulfur content, and by June 1969 the city had reduced the level of sulfur dioxide in the air by 28percent.

In December 1966, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Administrative%20Code">New York City Administrative Code</a> section on pollutant levels in the air was strengthened by a bill that was later described as the "toughest air pollution control bill in the country" at that time. Lindsay announced a plan to install 36 new stations for the Department of Air Pollution Control to measure air pollution levels throughout the city—an upgrade from the sole station in the Harlem Courthouse building. The stations would send data to a central computer using <a href="telemetry">telemetry</a> to create a profile of the city atmosphere. Five of those stations would also send data to the Interstate Sanitation Commission. The city purchased a computer system and equipment from the <a href="Packard%20Bell%20%281926%29">Packard Bell Company</a> for $181,000 ($ in dollars).

In November 1968, the city opened 38 monitoring stations, 10 outfitted with computer equipment. The 10 computerized stations were designed to send data every hour to the central computer, while the other 28 operated manually as backup. The old index system used during the 1966 smog, which produced a single number from multiple measurements, was abandoned as simplistic and unhelpful. The new index system was similar in that it used weather forecasts and measurements of pollutants in the air and had three progressive stages of severity ("alert," "warning," and "emergency") requiring stronger actions by city, industry, and citizens.

The city's actions mitigated air pollution and reduced the likelihood of a major smog event on the same scale. In contrast to dire warnings from the mayor's air-pollution task force in its May 1966 report, a city official said in 1969 "[w]e probably have the possibility of a health catastrophe under control now." The city declared minor smog alerts in 1967 and 1970; conversely, a four-day inversion similar to the Thanksgiving weather of 1966 occurred in September 1969, but it passed without incident—neither smog nor deaths resulted. <a href="Norman%20Cousins">Norman Cousins</a>, chairman of the mayor's task force, credited the regulations enacted since the 1966 smog for the prevention of a comparable September 1969 event. Cousins wrote in a message to Lindsay:

After the passage of strict new state and federal air regulations, the city passed its updated Air Pollution Control Code in 1971, designed in part to address concerns that <a href="nitrogen%20oxide">nitrogen oxide</a>s and <a href="unburned%20hydrocarbon">unburned hydrocarbon</a>s had been left insufficiently controlled by the previous changes. By 1972, New York City had cut levels of sulfur dioxide and particulates by half from their peak. According to an article published by the "EPA Journal" in 1986, those improvements at the city level were "the legacy of concern that emerged after the 1966 Thanksgiving Day smog disaster."

Prior to 1966, air-pollution control had largely been the responsibility of states and <a href="Local%20government%20in%20the%20United%20States">political subdivisions of states</a> like <a href="County%20%28United%20States%29">counties</a> and <a href="Municipality">municipalities</a> (cities and towns). The federal government played little role in air-pollution control, and to the extent that it did, its actions supported the efforts of states and local governments. For example, federal law provided resources like research, training, <a href="Grant%20%28law%29">grants</a> to improve state and local programs, and a conference procedure to convene agencies and polluters under the guidance of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services">Department of Health, Education and Welfare</a>. Direct regulations—such as, for example, setting emissions standards—were left to states.

The governors of New York (Rockefeller), New Jersey (Hughes), Delaware (<a href="Charles%20L.%20Terry%20Jr.">Charles L. Terry Jr.</a>), and Pennsylvania (<a href="Raymond%20P.%20Shafer">Raymond P. Shafer</a>) met in December 1966 to address air pollution in their region. Each governor pledged to enforce their state's pollution abatement laws and to prevent their own state from becoming a "pollution haven" <a href="Race%20to%20the%20bottom">with lax regulations to attract industry</a>.

At the same meeting, the governors also discussed the possibility of new <a href="tax%20incentive">tax incentive</a>s to motivate industry to reduce pollution and the creation of a new <a href="interstate%20compact">interstate compact</a> to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the <a href="Delaware%20River%20Basin%20Commission">Delaware River Basin Commission</a> (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls <a href="water%20pollution">water pollution</a> in the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a>. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%201968">the 1968 Republican presidential nomination</a>. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.

After the 1966 smog, "the consequences of state inaction were apparent to the naked eye," public outcry intensified, and the demand for federal intervention increased. New Jersey passed several new air-pollution laws in 1967. Nevertheless, traffic and drifting polluted air from New Jersey remained a major contributor to New York City's pollution problem. <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>—the physicist known for his role in developing the <a href="Thermonuclear%20weapon">hydrogen bomb</a> and an advisor to Mayor Lindsay on pollution and energy issues—advocated for New York state to adopt stricter sulfur fuel standards than the city. A leader of the <a href="advocacy%20group">advocacy group</a> Citizens for Cleaner Air criticized the local and state governments at a state public hearing, calling the city's enforcement "in a state of collapse" and, saying the city acting alone "cannot or will not enforce any standard or rule," demanded that the state government increase its role.

Perhaps the most notable critic of New York's inaction was <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a>. On a 1967 tour of pollution sources, Kennedy—then a New York Senator and soon to embark on his <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201968">1968 presidential campaign</a>—criticized the city, the states of New York and New Jersey, industry, and the federal government for their failures to adequately address the problem. Kennedy warned, "[w]e are just as close to an air-pollution disaster as we were last Thanksgiving." In Kennedy's view, the solution would have to come from the federal government, as state and local agencies lacked the ability or oversight for the task.

Air pollution control, already a priority of President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>'s administration, became a greater concern after the smog. By early 1967, his statements on air pollution became more rhetorically urgent. In January 1967, Johnson sent a message to Congress entitled "Protecting Our National Heritage," the first section of which was entitled "The Pollution of Our Air" and focused on the problems posed by air pollution. The message was prompted by wide public discussion of the problem following the 1966 smog. Johnson cited the experiences of specific American cities and towns in the message, and highlighted the 1966 smog at length:

Johnson called for a bill regulating toxins in the air and increasing funding for pollution programs. <a href="Edmund%20Muskie">Edmund Muskie</a>, a Senator from Maine and political <a href="Environmentalism">environmentalist</a>, praised Johnson's words, pledged to hold <a href="United%20States%20congressional%20hearing">hearings</a> on the proposals, and would soon <a href="Sponsor%20%28legislative%29">sponsor</a> the Johnson administration's bill, which became the Air Quality Act. Muskie also co-sponsored bills in 1967 for research on non-polluting automobiles using either <a href="electric%20car">electric</a> or <a href="Fuel%20cell%20vehicle">fuel cell</a> technology. While discussing the research bills on the Senate floor, Muskie said "the serious air pollution situation in New York City [in November of 1966] dramatically illustrated what our cities may be facing in the future if an alternative to the [internal] combustion engine is not developed."

Congressional interest and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since the signing of the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure spurred by the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the <a href="Clean%20Air%20Act%20%28United%20States%29%23Legislation">1967 Air Quality Act</a>, which amended the <a href="Clean%20Air%20Act%20%28United%20States%29%23Introduction">1963 Clean Air Act</a> to provide for study of air quality and control methods.

The Air Quality Act was a significant advancement in the realm of air-pollution regulation, but one that was ultimately ineffective. In "Train v. Natural Resources Defense Counsel", a 1975 decision by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, Justice <a href="William%20Rehnquist">William Rehnquist</a> summarized the law's effect as follows:

Among contemporaneous critics, John C. Esposito—an environmentalist and affiliate of <a href="Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</a>—wrote the 1970 book "Vanishing Air" to accuse Muskie of watering down the bill and adding needless complications to satisfy industry. A 2011 encyclopedia of environmental law article judged that the act "was a failure but it was the first step in federal air pollution control." Calls for greater air pollution regulation in this era culminated with the passage under President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> of the <a href="Clean%20Air%20Act%20%28United%20States%29%23Clean%20Air%20Act%20of%201970">1970 Clean Air Act</a>, which supplanted the Air Quality Act and has been described as the most significant environmental legislation in American history. The 1970 Clean Air Act significantly increased the role of the federal government and, for the first time, imposed air quality requirements on states.

The most widely recognized legacy of the 1966 smog was the political reaction to it, which galvanized the nascent <a href="environmental%20movement%20in%20the%20United%20States">environmental movement in the United States</a> and prompted demand for sweeping air-pollution control laws. The smog has been remembered for various purposes by scientists, historians, journalists, writers, artists, activists, and political commentators.

The full range of negative <a href="health%20effects%20arising%20from%20the%20September%2011%20attacks">health effects arising from the September 11 attacks</a> came to light in the years following the attacks. The 1966 smog serves, along with the earlier major New York City smog events in 1953 and 1963, as a precedent used for comparison with the air effects caused by the <a href="collapse%20of%20the%20World%20Trade%20Center">collapse of the World Trade Center</a>. The 1966 smog and other historical smog events differ from the September11 pollution in significant ways that limit their usefulness as a point of comparison. Prior New York City smog events were chronic, cumulative, and caused by thousands of small sources, while the air impact of the September was sudden, intense, and the result of a single culpable source. The absence of prior events similar to the September11 attacks left "a hole in the medical library," and presented medical experts with a challenge in the absence of "hard knowledge about the health consequences of intense brief pollution."

Other major air pollution, particularly in China, has been compared to the 1966 smog. Elizabeth M. Lynch, a New York City legal scholar, said that images of visible air pollution in Beijing from 2012 were "gross" but not "that much different from pictures of New York City in the 1950s and 1960s", specifically referring to the 1952, 1962, and 1966 smog events. Lynch wrote that the Chinese government's increased transparency on the issue was an encouraging sign that pollution in China could be regulated and abated just as it had in the United States. Similar comparisons between the 1966 smog and Chinese pollution in late 2012 appeared in "<a href="Business%20Insider">Business Insider</a>" and "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>". "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" cited the 1966 smog after China issued its first "<a href="Pollution%20in%20China%23Four-color%20alert%20system">red alert</a>" air quality warning in December 2015; the same month, an article in "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" used the 1966 smog to argue that China could follow the United States' model to regulate pollution.

The smog event has been referenced in pop culture. Smog figures into the plot of the 2012 "<a href="Mad%20Men">Mad Men</a>" episode "<a href="Dark%20Shadows%20%28Mad%20Men%29">Dark Shadows</a>", which is set in New York City during the same Thanksgiving weekend in 1966. A reviewer in "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" interpreted the writers' use of the smog as a symbolic representation of the character <a href="Betty%20Draper">Betty</a>, who spends the episode "longing to enter <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Don%20Draper">Don Draper's</a><nowiki>]</nowiki> apartment and tear some shit up""hover[ing]" and "waiting to poison it from within". The New York City-based <a href="indie%20pop">indie pop</a> band <a href="Vampire%20Weekend">Vampire Weekend</a> used a photograph of the smog over the city skyline, taken by Neal Boenzi and originally published in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", for the cover of their 2013 album "<a href="Modern%20Vampires%20of%20the%20City">Modern Vampires of the City</a>".

Following the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016 election</a> of <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> to the presidency, <a href="Environmental%20policy%20of%20the%20Donald%20Trump%20administration">his administration's environmental proposals</a>—including steep budget cuts to the EPA and <a href="deregulation">deregulation</a>—prompted several reflections on the environmental condition of the United States prior to the creation of the EPA. "The New York Times", <a href="Vice%20Media">Vice Media</a>'s tech-news site "Motherboard", public radio station <a href="WNYC">WNYC</a>, real estate news site "6sqft", and environmental <a href="advocacy%20group">advocacy group</a> <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Defense%20Council">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> (NRDC) connected Trump's declared policies to the risk of returning to a more polluted environment, with each publication evoking the 1966 smog as an example of the potential dangers of defunding and deregulation. David Hawkins, an attorney for NRDC, recalled, "I was a student at <a href="Columbia%20Law%20School">Columbia Law School</a> during the 1966 episode. It was frightening, but while that is the best-known event, heavy pollution was an everyday fact of life those days."

Dick Cresswell

Richard (Dick) Cresswell, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> (27 July 1920 – 12 December 2006) was an officer and pilot in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He held command of <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron</a> twice during World War II, and again during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Cresswell was credited with being the first RAAF pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft at night over Australian soil, the only man to serve as commanding officer of an RAAF squadron on three occasions during wartime, and the first officer to lead a jet-equipped Australian squadron in combat. His performance in Korea earned him both the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Commonwealth</a> and the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">US Distinguished Flying Crosses</a>.

Born in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, Cresswell worked as an apprentice electrician before joining the RAAF in July 1938. He initially commanded No. 77 Squadron from April 1942 to August 1943, flying <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawks</a> in defence of Australia's <a href="North%20Western%20Area%20Campaign">North-Western Area</a> against Japanese raiders. Cresswell claimed the squadron's first aerial victory—the first by an Australian over the mainland—in November 1942. He was <a href="wing%20leader">wing leader</a> of <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 (Fighter) Wing</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a> from May 1944 to March 1945, simultaneously commanding No. 77 Squadron for a second time between September and December 1944. In September 1950, during the Korean War, Cresswell took command of No. 77 Squadron in combat for the third time. He oversaw its conversion from <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustangs</a> to <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a>s, becoming the first RAAF commander of a jet squadron in war. As well as Meteors, Cresswell flew <a href="Lockheed%20P-80%20Shooting%20Star">F-80 Shooting Star</a> and <a href="North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a> jets in combat while on attachment to the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> in Korea. He handed over command of No. 77 Squadron for the last time in August 1951, but flew six more missions as a Meteor pilot in 1953.

Cresswell was responsible for converting pilots to jet fighters as commanding officer of <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a> in Australia from 1953 until 1956. He resigned from the RAAF the following year, and flew with <a href="Bobby%20Gibbes">Bobby Gibbes</a>' Sepik Airways in New Guinea before joining <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Australia">de Havilland Australia</a> in 1959. Initially engaged by the company as a pilot, he later became a salesman. Cresswell resigned from de Havilland in 1974, but maintained his connection with military aviation, including No. 77 Squadron. He died in December 2006, aged eighty-six.

Richard Cresswell was born in <a href="Youngtown%2C%20Tasmania">Franklin</a>, near <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a>, Tasmania, on 27 July 1920. He was the only child of English immigrants George Cresswell, an engineer, and his wife Constance (née <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland">de Havilland</a>). His father died when Dick was three-and-a-half, and he later moved to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> with his mother. For three years he lived with another family in <a href="Balgowlah%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Balgowlah</a>, and commenced his schooling at Manly West. He again lived with his mother in <a href="Potts%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Potts Point</a> between 1931 and 1938, continuing his education at <a href="Double%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Double Bay</a> and <a href="Randwick%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Randwick</a>. After leaving Randwick High School in 1935, he began technical studies at <a href="Ultimo%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Ultimo</a> as part of an electrical apprenticeship with <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20Corporation">Westinghouse</a>.

Fired partly by his mother's stories of joy flights in <a href="World%20War%20I">pre-war</a> Britain, and a desire to become a <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> captain for <a href="Imperial%20Airways">Imperial Airways</a>, Cresswell applied to join the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in September 1937. Receiving no answer from the RAF, he applied for the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), and was accepted. He entered <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, as an air cadet in July 1938. Over the next twelve months he learnt to fly in <a href="Avro%20643%20Cadet">Avro Cadet</a>, <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">de Havilland Gipsy Moth</a> and <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a> trainers, and graduated as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a>. His first posting was to <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">Richmond</a>, New South Wales, where he began flying <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a> fighters in July 1939. Cresswell recalled a mix of excitement and panic within the squadron when <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">World War II broke out</a> two months later: "The second night we all slept on the hangar floor next to our aircraft. Imagine it: there was war over in Europe and here we were at action stations!"

After a brief posting to Point Cook in early 1940, Cresswell undertook the instructors' course at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> in <a href="Camden%20Airport%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Camden</a>, New South Wales. He then became an instructor at <a href="No.%202%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Service Flying Training School</a>, which was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Wagga">Wagga Wagga</a> in July and operated <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s and <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s. The school's commander, <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>, advised Cresswell to grow a moustache to overcome his youthful appearance. He was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in January 1941. Following the <a href="bombing%20of%20Darwin">bombing of Darwin</a> by Japanese forces on 19 February 1942, Cresswell was posted to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">Williamtown</a> as a liaison officer with the <a href="9th%20Attack%20Squadron">9th Squadron</a> of the US 49th Pursuit Group (later the <a href="49th%20Operations%20Group">49th Fighter Group</a>), which operated <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawks</a> and would shortly transfer to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> to provide air defence for the <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a>.

The RAAF had meanwhile raised three fighter units—<a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 75</a>, <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">76</a> and <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">77 Squadrons</a>—equipped with Kittyhawks recently delivered from the United States. Cresswell, newly promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, assumed command of No. 77 Squadron at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">Pearce</a>, Western Australia, on 20 April. At twenty-one, he was younger than most of his personnel. Drawing on his technical experience at Westinghouse, he encouraged his pilots to respect their aircraft and the ground crews that maintained them. Initially responsible for the air defence of <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, No. 77 Squadron transferred to <a href="Batchelor%20Airfield">Batchelor Airfield</a> near Darwin in August, becoming the first RAAF fighter unit to be stationed in the North-Western Area. It moved to another of Darwin's satellite airfields, <a href="Livingstone%20Airfield">Livingstone</a>, in September. Cresswell led the squadron in the defence of Darwin against Japanese raiders and claimed its first aerial victory just after 5 a.m. on 23 November 1942, when he destroyed a <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">Mitsubishi "Betty"</a> bomber. It was the first "kill" for an Australian squadron over the mainland, and the first night victory over Australia. When he returned to base and was asked what he felt like, Cresswell replied, "Breakfast". He souvenired the radio operator's seat from the bomber's wreckage.
In February 1943, after <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 1 (Fighter) Wing</a> and its three <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> squadrons became operational in the Darwin area, No. 77 Squadron was transferred to <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> in New Guinea. It came under the control of the newly formed <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a>, which was part of <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group</a>, the RAAF's main mobile formation in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a>. The Japanese attacked Milne Bay on 14 April, and Cresswell claimed one of four bombers (and a fighter) credited to No. 77 Squadron. The next month, No. 77 Squadron began moving to <a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a>, where it was controlled by <a href="No.%2073%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 73 Wing</a>. As Japanese fighter opposition was limited, Cresswell led the squadron in several ground-attack missions over <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>. He was due to hand over command to his designated successor, Flight Lieutenant Daryl Sproule, on 2 August, but Sproule crash-landed during a raid the same day and was captured and executed by the Japanese. As a result, Cresswell remained in command another three weeks.

On 28 August 1943, Cresswell was ordered to report to <a href="Port%20Pirie%20Airport">Port Pirie</a>, South Australia, for "flying duties", but found instead that he was to be <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led for "conduct to the prejudice of good order and Air Force discipline". The charge arose from an incident in July 1942, when Cresswell had stayed overnight at Port Pirie's <a href="mess">mess</a> and had fired his <a href="revolver">revolver</a> into the floor next to the feet of another officer who apparently had been annoying him. Cresswell was found guilty and lost three months' seniority. He considered resigning his commission but was placated by the Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a>. Cresswell was promoted to <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in January 1944, backdated three months to eliminate the penalty of his court-martial.

After instructing at <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a> in <a href="Mildura%20Airport">Mildura</a>, Victoria, Cresswell was appointed <a href="wing%20leader">wing leader</a> of No. 1 Wing on 25 February 1944, at the specific request of its commander, Group Captain <a href="Peter%20Jeffrey%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Peter Jeffery</a>, to help reduce Spitfire accident rates. In March, No. 1 Wing hurriedly despatched two squadrons to <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> in response to fears that a Japanese naval force <a href="Western%20Australian%20emergency%20of%20March%201944">would raid the Perth area</a>; no attack ensued, and the squadrons returned within two weeks. Darwin was by now free of Japanese raids and Cresswell left on 12 May to become wing leader and temporary commander of <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 (Fighter) Wing</a> in <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland. Comprising three Kittyhawk squadrons, including No. 77, the wing transferred to <a href="Noemfoor">Noemfoor</a> in western New Guinea as part of No. 10 Operational Group (later <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">First Tactical Air Force</a>), which had taken over No. 9 Group's mobile role and was supporting the US landings along the north coast of New Guinea.

Cresswell arrived at Noemfoor on 26 September 1944 to be informed by No. 81 Wing's new commander, Group Captain <a href="Gordon%20Steege">Gordon Steege</a>, that he did not need a wing leader. Instead, Steege assigned Cresswell to command No. 77 Squadron, for the second time during the war. Cresswell questioned the decision through official channels, with the result that he retained the position of wing leader, as well as the command of No. 77 Squadron. The wing flew 1,125 sorties against Japanese buildings, stores and transport in October and November, dropping over of bombs for the loss of fifteen aircraft and eleven pilots. The following month, Group Captain <a href="Wilfred%20Arthur">Wilfred Arthur</a> replaced Steege as commander of No. 81 Wing, and Cresswell handed over command of No. 77 Squadron, while continuing to serve as wing leader. Arthur recommended Cresswell for a <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, but according to biographer <a href="George%20Odgers">George Odgers</a> this was "'lost' in the system".

The relegation of First Tactical Air Force to areas of operation bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale. Arthur produced a "balance sheet" to demonstrate that No. 81 Wing's combat results were not worth the cost in ordnance and casualties, setting in train events that would culminate in the so-called "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>" the following April, when eight senior pilots, including Arthur and fellow <a href="Flying%20ace">aces</a> <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Gibbes">Bobby Gibbes</a>, protested by attempting to resign their commissions. Cresswell was by then in Australia on leave, having posted out from No. 81 Wing in March. Though in complete accord with the aims of the "mutineers", he believed that attempting to resign their commissions en masse was not an appropriate response.

Cresswell was on the twelve-week War Staff Course at the RAAF Staff School in <a href="Mount%20Martha%2C%20Victoria">Mount Martha</a>, Victoria, when hostilities ended in the Pacific; the course finished on 28 September 1945. He was then tasked with developing a <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> conversion course, to train pilots for service with No. 81 Wing, comprising three Mustang squadrons, including No. 77, as part of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> in Japan. On 1 February 1946, the crew conversion unit, CCU (Fighter), was established at Williamtown. Cresswell served initially as the CCU's chief instructor, and then as commanding officer from 29 March 1947. At the same time, he took command of the Williamtown base, as well as <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 (Fighter) Wing</a>, which controlled two Mustang squadrons and several ancillary units. He had married a war widow, Bettine Harrison-Owen (née Cotter), on 27 July 1946 at St John's Church in <a href="Toorak%2C%20Victoria">Toorak</a>, Victoria. CCU (Fighter) disbanded on 7 July 1947, but Cresswell remained in command of Williamtown and No. 78 Wing until March 1948.

After a posting to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">Amberley</a>, Queensland, Cresswell served on the directing staff of the first two courses held at the newly formed <a href="RAAF%20Staff%20College">RAAF Staff College</a>, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13 June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following <a href="demobilisation">demobilisation</a>. On 10 July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of <a href="No.%2021%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron</a>, a Citizen Air Force unit based at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">Laverton</a> and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.

When the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> broke out on 25 June 1950, No. 77 Squadron was the only remaining RAAF unit of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. Led by Wing Commander <a href="Lou%20Spence">Lou Spence</a>, the squadron was preparing to return to Australia when it was placed on standby for action over Korea; it began operations as part of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) peacekeeping force a week later. Spence was killed in action on 9 September, and Cresswell was despatched to replace him as commanding officer. Cresswell thus became the only officer to lead the same RAAF squadron on three occasions during wartime. According to George Odgers, his prior command of the squadron in combat and long experience flying single-engined aircraft, including the Mustang, meant that "it would have been very difficult to find a RAAF fighter pilot who could equal Squadron Leader Cresswell's qualifications". Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war Air Force, noted that Cresswell was considered "a good organiser and a 'goer'". In an unusual move, the RAAF did not raise him to wing commander; he became No. 77 Squadron's longest-serving commanding officer of the Korean War, but also the only one ranked squadron leader. This had the effect of ranking him below the US squadron commanders with whom he had to cooperate and of leaving him without an <a href="Executive%20officer%23Military">operations officer</a> of squadron leader rank to whom he could delegate some of the day-to-day tasks of running his unit.
Spence's loss was a heavy blow to the squadron, and Cresswell's first task after arriving in Japan on 17 September 1950 was to restore morale. Pilot Jim Flemming recalled that Cresswell "led from the front", undertaking four sorties on 20 September, his first day of operations. No. 77 Squadron transferred from <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Iwakuni">Iwakuni</a> in Japan to <a href="Pohang">Pohang</a>, South Korea, on 12 October to support UN troops advancing northwards from the <a href="Pusan%20Perimeter">Pusan Perimeter</a> following General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s <a href="Battle%20of%20Inchon">amphibious landing</a> behind North Korean lines at <a href="Incheon">Inchon</a>. On 20 October, the squadron became a component of the RAAF's newly established <a href="No.%2091%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 91 (Composite) Wing</a>, headquartered at Iwakuni, but was under the operational control of the US <a href="35th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Group">35th Fighter-Interceptor Group</a>. Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni-based wing headquarters was not always in tune with frontline requirements, and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General <a href="Horace%20Robertson">Sir Horace Robertson</a>, BCOF commander and the theatre's senior Australian officer, and the RAAF's <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal Scherger, former commander at Wagga Wagga.

China entered the war in October 1950, and No. 77 Squadron undertook its first <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s against Chinese ground forces on 1 November. It flew its first missions supporting the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> four days later, when Cresswell led attacks on Chinese armour opposing the <a href="3rd%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BBattalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a>, at <a href="Pakchon%20County">Pakchon</a>. The 3rd Battalion's Major <a href="Ian%20Bruce%20Ferguson">Bruce Ferguson</a> described No. 77 Squadron's close support as "the closest I have ever seen". On 16 November, the Australians began moving forward with the 35th Group to Yonpo, near <a href="Hamhung">Hamhung</a>. From Yonpo they flew missions against Chinese forces surrounding the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">US Marines</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Chosin%20Reservoir">Chosin Reservoir</a>; Cresswell personally commanded several night sorties, attacking Chinese positions with machine guns and rockets. The Communist advance resulted in the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to <a href="Pusan">Pusan</a> in early December. Cresswell had made a point of briefing his squadron every night during the developing crisis to avoid any panic arising from unsubstantiated rumours; the commander of the US <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>, Lieutenant General <a href="Earle%20E.%20Partridge">Earle E. Partridge</a>, praised him for his leadership.

Since November 1950, the Communists had been operating a Russian-designed swept-wing jet fighter, the <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-15">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15</a>, that outclassed all other fighters in the theatre except the new <a href="North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a>. The MiGs were often flown by seasoned <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Forces">Soviet Air Force</a> pilots, whose deployment was unofficial, and denied at the time by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The RAAF tried to purchase Sabres to replace No. 77 Squadron's Mustangs but deliveries could not begin until 1954, so in December the Australian government agreed to buy British <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a> straight-wing jet fighters. In January and February 1951, while awaiting delivery of the Meteors, Cresswell gained jet experience by converting to <a href="Lockheed%20P-80%20Shooting%20Star">F-80 Shooting Stars</a> and flying ten combat missions on attachment to the USAF's <a href="8th%20Operations%20Group">8th Fighter Group</a>. This convinced him that the Meteors would require <a href="radio%20compass">radio compass</a>es to navigate in bad weather, and with the support of the USAF he succeeded in having these fitted. No. 77 Squadron completed its last Mustang mission on 6 April 1951 and returned to Iwakuni the next day to begin converting to Meteors. Since July 1950 it had been credited with destroying sixty armoured vehicles and guns, 600 other vehicles, and over 2,000 buildings. Sixteen Mustangs had been destroyed and thirteen pilots killed. The squadron's loss rate in Korea was higher than it had sustained in a similar period during World War II. On 20 April, the Americans awarded Cresswell the <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a> for "meritorious service" and the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for "superior flying ability and extraordinary achievement". Permission to wear the decorations was <a href="The%20London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 22 June and 13 July, respectively.
Though it had operated mainly as a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No. 77 Squadron's primary role in the RAAF was interception, and it was hoped that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in Korea. Cresswell therefore arranged for the USAF to lend him a Sabre to simulate a MiG-15 in combat training with the Meteors at Iwakuni; he determined that the Meteor's manoeuvrability and rate of climb allowed it to match the swept-wing jet below , so that the best air-to-air tactic would be to work in concert with USAF Sabres operating at high level while the Australians flew at lower altitudes. On 20 July, No. 77 Squadron began moving to <a href="Gimpo">Kimpo</a>, South Korea, where it was tasked by the USAF's <a href="4th%20Fighter%20Wing">4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing</a>.

Cresswell took the squadron on its first Meteor operation on 29 July, an offensive sweep in "<a href="MiG%20Alley">MiG Alley</a>" between the <a href="Yalu%20River">Yalu</a> and <a href="Chongchon%20River">Chongchon River</a>s on North Korea's border with <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, making him the first officer to lead an RAAF jet squadron in combat. After encountering ill-directed anti-aircraft fire over <a href="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a>, the Australians saw MiG-15s parked in an airfield on the Chinese side of the border—where UN forces were forbidden to attack—but, somewhat to Cresswell's annoyance, the Communists refused to take off and fight. He led the squadron on further offensive sweeps with USAF Sabres, and missions escorting <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortresses</a>, but had no contact with MiGs in the air before completing his term as commanding officer and handing over to Wing Commander Steege on 16 August 1951.

Although no longer commanding a squadron, Cresswell continued flying in Korea. He secured another attachment to the USAF and converted to the F-86 Sabre in early September 1951. Between 22 September and 1 October, he flew ten combat missions in Sabres with the <a href="336th%20Fighter%20Squadron">336th Fighter Interceptor Squadron</a>, dogfighting with MiG-15s on several occasions and damaging one. Cresswell left for Australia shortly afterwards, having flown a total of 144 sorties during the war: 110 in Mustangs, fourteen in Meteors, and ten each in Shooting Stars and Sabres. He was recommended for the Commonwealth Distinguished Flying Cross for "leadership of high order" on 23 October 1951; the award was promulgated on 8 January 1952. According to Alan Stephens, "many who were familiar with his performance thought the higher <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> would have been more appropriate. There were suggestions that his occasional flamboyance, confidence and impressive combat experience were resented by more pedestrian senior RAAF officers".

Upon returning to Australia, Cresswell was promoted to wing commander and appointed Fighter Staff Member at the RAAF Directorate of Operations. In late 1952 he was "dared" to fly from the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> aircraft carrier <a href="HMAS%20Sydney%20%28R17%29">HMAS "Sydney"</a>, and did so in a <a href="Hawker%20Sea%20Fury">Hawker Sea Fury</a> after completing conversion. In his capacity as RAAF Fighter Staff Member, Cresswell returned to Korea in March–April 1953, flying six Meteor sorties with No. 77 Squadron, and reporting deficiencies in instrument flying and air combat technique among the pilots. An <a href="Korean%20Armistice%20Agreement">armistice</a> ended the Korean War on 27 July.

Post-war demobilisation had seen the disbandment of all the RAAF's operational training units, and conversion of new pilots to combat aircraft became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, and the advent of the Korean War and the introduction of jets exacerbated shortfalls in operational training. Cresswell recalled that as commanding officer of No. 77 Squadron in Korea he had to send several replacement pilots back to Australia: "I don't blame the pilots, but I do blame the Air Force system. We had no operational training units, no operational training system and, as a result, the pilots came to Korea poorly trained and without instrument ratings. They just couldn't operate in the area."

The RAAF re-formed No. 2 Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU) in March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at Williamtown, No. 2 OTU was initially equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a> jets. Cresswell assumed command on 21 May 1953. He established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight in November, to prepare for the introduction into service of Australian-built <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>s. As well as performance testing, the <a href="flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> was responsible for teaching air-to-air combat techniques, to fill a capability void caused by the departure of many veteran fighter pilots of World War II, and the RAAF's operational focus on ground attack rather than air combat in Korea. To facilitate the training, Cresswell and another pilot developed the RAAF's fighter combat instructor course, which has continued to be administered at Williamtown by No. 2 OTU's successor formation, <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit</a>.

On 3 December 1954, Cresswell led a formation of twelve No. 2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No. 77 Squadron upon its return from Korea aboard the aircraft carrier <a href="HMS%20Vengeance%20%28R71%29">HMAS "Vengeance"</a>. His successor as commanding officer of the conversion unit took over on 27 March 1956. Cresswell was posted to RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, as Director of Air Staff Policy. The position put him in line for promotion to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> but, as he admitted later, "I had itchy feet and I felt the Service had already given me all the operational flying I was likely to get." He decided to resign his commission in December 1956, and was discharged from the RAAF on 30 April 1957.

On 13 June 1957, Cresswell became regional manager of a Melbourne firm salvaging metal from the battlefields of New Guinea, but the company wound up its operations in Australasia barely a month later. Bobby Gibbes then offered him the position of chief pilot with his New Guinea-based <a href="Sepik%20Airways">Sepik Airways</a>. Cresswell flew <a href="Noorduyn%20Norseman">Noorduyn Norseman</a> and <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B52">Junkers Ju 52</a> aircraft out of <a href="Goroka">Goroka</a> until October 1958, when he was hospitalised with <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a>. He attempted to rejoin the RAAF the following year but was found to be suffering from <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="dengue%20fever">dengue fever</a>, as well as the after-effects of hepatitis. On 6 October 1959, he joined <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Australia">de Havilland Australia</a> to fly <a href="De%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-2%20Beaver">DHC-2 Beavers</a> in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. Cresswell's first marriage had failed after his return from the Korean War in 1951. He married Margaret Schwennesen, a pilot, on 23 December 1959 at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne; the couple had two daughters.

Cresswell began flying in Antarctica on 14 January 1960, mapping sections of the continent claimed by Australia. The task was cut short on 3 February, when the <a href="Antarctic%20Flight%20RAAF">RAAF Antarctic Flight</a> pressed his Beaver into service after three of its aircraft were lost in a blizzard at <a href="Mawson%20Station">Mawson</a>. De Havilland then assigned Cresswell to fly personnel and equipment for Australian Blue Metal in <a href="Northern%20Australia">northern</a> and <a href="central%20Australia">central Australia</a>. Between November 1960 and March 1961 he was involved in another Antarctic expedition, but in the end did little flying. De Havilland subsequently appointed Cresswell its sales representative in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>; in this capacity he travelled abroad and on one occasion flew the <a href="De%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">DHC-4 Caribou</a>, shortly to be purchased by the RAAF for tactical transport in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

After a series of minor heart attacks and two <a href="Coronary%20artery%20bypass%20surgery">bypass operations</a>, Cresswell resigned from de Havilland late in 1974 to live in <a href="South-East%20Queensland">South-East Queensland</a>; his family elected to remain in Canberra. Cresswell continued his interest in military aviation, maintaining his RAAF connections, and patronising the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> (AWM) and the No. 77 Squadron Association. In April 1975 he presented the AWM with the radio operator's seat from the "Betty" he shot down in November 1942. After divorcing Margaret, he married a third time in 1979 but his new wife died two years later, and he returned to Canberra in the mid-1980s at the urging of his daughters. In 1992 he led members of No. 77 Squadron in a march through the streets of Perth, which had granted the unit freedom of entry in recognition of its role in the city's defence fifty years earlier. Cresswell also undertook speaking engagements, including the annual veterans' symposium at the <a href="Australian%20Command%20and%20Staff%20College">Australian Command and Staff College</a> (ACSC). On 23 July 1998, he was at Williamtown for the formal presentation of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20Presidential%20Unit%20Citation">Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation</a> that had been awarded to No. 77 Squadron on 1 November 1951 for its performance in the Korean War. He visited the newly completed Bradbury Aircraft Hall at the AWM in August 2000, commenting, "The past has a very strong will to live". The following April, he was among thirty-two Korean War veterans selected to represent Australia at fiftieth anniversary commemorations of the conflict being held in South Korea.

Cresswell died in Canberra of a heart attack on 13 December 2006, aged eighty-six, and was survived by his second wife Margaret and their two daughters. His funeral was held at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, which was overflown by four <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> jet fighters from No. 77 Squadron in a "<a href="Missing%20man%20formation">missing man</a>" formation. In 2007, an exercise at the ACSC was named after Cresswell.

After the Deluge (painting)

After the Deluge, also known as The Forty-First Day, is a <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> by English artist <a href="George%20Frederic%20Watts">George Frederic Watts</a>, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows a scene from the story of <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Noah's Flood</a>, in which after 40 days of rain <a href="Noah">Noah</a> opens the window of <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">his Ark</a> to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting takes the form of a stylised <a href="seascape">seascape</a>, dominated by a bright <a href="sunburst">sunburst</a> breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in "The Genius of Greek Poetry" in 1878, "After the Deluge" took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a <a href="Monotheism">monotheistic</a> God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.

The unfinished painting was exhibited in <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of The Sun. Watts worked on the painting for a further five years, and the completed version was exhibited for the first time at the <a href="New%20Gallery%20%28London%29">New Gallery</a> in 1891. Between 1902 and 1906 the painting was exhibited around the United Kingdom, and it is now in the collection of the <a href="Watts%20Gallery">Watts Gallery</a> in <a href="Compton%2C%20Guildford">Compton</a>, Surrey. As Watts did not include "After the Deluge" in his gift to the nation of what he considered his most significant works, it is not among his better-known paintings. However, it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other painters who worked in the two decades following its initial exhibition.

<a href="George%20Frederic%20Watts">George Frederic Watts</a> was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20schools">Royal Academy schools</a>, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.

In 1843 he travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from <a href="melancholia">melancholia</a>, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at <a href="Little%20Holland%20House">Little Holland House</a>, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

"After the Deluge" depicts a scene from the story of <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Noah's Flood</a>, in which <a href="Noah">Noah</a> opens the window of <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">the Ark</a> to see that after forty days the rain has ended, but that the floodwaters have not yet subsided. Although his father's strict <a href="evangelical%20Christianity">evangelical Christianity</a> had instilled in Watts a strong dislike of organised religion, he had a deep knowledge of the Bible, and Noah and the Flood were both themes he regularly depicted throughout his career. 

Watts had a strong belief in the idea that modern society was prioritising wealth over social values, and that this attitude, which he described as "the hypocritical veiling of the daily sacrifice made to this deity", was leading to the decline of society. Hilary Underwood of the <a href="University%20of%20Surrey">University of Surrey</a> writes that Watts likely painted so many works on the theme of Noah as he saw modern parallels with the notion of the cleaning of a degenerate society while preserving those who still adhered to moral standards. Watts chose to depict the moment at which the sun became visible for the first time, after 40 days obscured by clouds.

Watts illustrated the scene with a highly stylised <a href="seascape">seascape</a>. Above the sea is a bright <a href="sunburst">sunburst</a>, with the light of the sun illuminating the surrounding clouds and bright rays projecting beyond the edges of the canvas.
Watts's composition echoes <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>'s 1843 treatment of the same topic, "<a href="Light%20and%20Colour%20%28Goethe%27s%20Theory%29%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Morning%20after%20the%20Deluge%20%E2%80%93%20Moses%20Writing%20the%20Book%20of%20Genesis">Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis</a>", in primarily depicting a circle of bright light. However, Turner's painting depicts recognisable human figures, and no work by Turner ever came as close to pure <a href="abstract%20art">abstract art</a> as Watts's composition.

In this stage of his career Watts regularly painted images linking awe-inspiring natural events and the will of God. His focus on the sun reflects his longstanding interest in it as a divine symbol; "The Sacrifice of Noah", painted 1865, showed Noah sacrificing to the sun in thanks for his family's salvation. This interest in the sun possibly came from Watts's acquaintance <a href="Max%20M%C3%BCller">Max Müller</a>, who had written extensively on <a href="solar%20theory">solar theories of mythology</a> (the belief that the religions of Europe, the Middle East and southern Asia were all ultimately derived from <a href="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Proto-Indo-European</a> worship of the sun). Writing after Watts's death, his widow <a href="Mary%20Seton%20Watts">Mary Seton Watts</a> wrote that:

Watts had previously depicted an orange sun above a flat sea in his 1878 work "The Genius of Greek Poetry", but the theme and composition of "After the Deluge" was radically different. "The Genius of Greek Poetry" was intended to evoke <a href="pantheism">pantheism</a>, with figures representing the forces of nature in human form working and playing, while being watched by the large central figure of the Genius. "After the Deluge" was explicitly intended as a <a href="monotheistic">monotheistic</a> image, evoking both the magnificence and the redemptive mercy of a single all-powerful God engaging in the act of creation. 

"After the Deluge" was exhibited in unfinished form in 1886 as "The Sun" at <a href="St%20Jude%27s%20Church%2C%20Whitechapel">St Jude's Church, Whitechapel</a>; <a href="Samuel%20Barnett%20%28reformer%29">Samuel Barnett</a>, vicar of St Jude's, organised annual art exhibitions in east London in an effort to bring beauty into the lives of the poor; he had a close relationship with Watts, and regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents. Following this exhibition Watts continued to work on the painting for a further five years.

The completed version of "After the Deluge" was exhibited at the <a href="New%20Gallery%20%28London%29">New Gallery</a> in 1891. On the occasion of its 1891 exhibition and at a later exhibition in 1897, also at the New Gallery, it was accompanied by an explanatory note (thought to have been written by Watts) explaining the image:
Between 1902 and 1906 it was exhibited around the country, being shown in Cork, Edinburgh, Manchester and Dublin, as well as at Watts's own gallery at Little Holland House. In 1904 it was transferred to the newly-opened <a href="Watts%20Gallery">Watts Gallery</a> in <a href="Compton%2C%20Guildford">Compton</a>, Surrey, shortly before Watts's death later that year. Two years prior to this, Watts had returned to the theme of creation with "The Sower of the Systems", which for the first time in one of his works directly depicted God, and which he described as representing "a great gesture into which everything that exists is woven".

Although Watts painted landscapes throughout his life, he did not consider such paintings to be major works, and when between 1886 and 1902 he donated what he felt to be his 23 most significant non-portrait works to the nation for public display, no landscape paintings were included. As a consequence of its omission from these gifts to the nation, "After the Deluge" is not among his better-known works, although it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists. <a href="Walter%20Bayes">Walter Bayes</a> wrote in 1907 that "After the Deluge" was "the sort of landscape that we connect with the name of Mr Watts, a landscape from which all that is coarse and material has been eliminated, and which offers a residuum that is a kind of sublimation of all the most poetic elements in nature". It has been cited as an influence on many works painted in the two decades following its completion, including paintings of the sun by <a href="Maurice%20Chabas">Maurice Chabas</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Pellizza%20da%20Volpedo">Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo</a> and <a href="Edvard%20Munch">Edvard Munch</a>. "After the Deluge" remains in the collection of the Watts Gallery.

Loss of MV Darlwyne

MV "Darlwyne" was a pleasure cruiser, a converted <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="picket%20boat">picket boat</a>, that disappeared off the <a href="Cornwall">Cornish</a> coast on 31 July 1966 with its complement of thirty-one (two crew and twenty-nine passengers including eight children). Twelve bodies and a few artefacts were later recovered, but the rest of the victims and the main body of the wreck were never found.

Built in 1941, after ending its naval service in 1957 "Darlwyne" was used as a private cabin cruiser, first on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> and later in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, where it became a commercial passenger boat, despite being unlicensed for such work. It underwent considerable structural modifications, including the removal of its original <a href="watertight%20bulkhead">watertight bulkhead</a>s and the conversion of its <a href="aft">aft</a> cabin into a large open cockpit. These changes adversely affected its seaworthiness. Surveyors' reports in 1964 and 1966 indicated that "Darlwyne" was unfit for the open sea; furthermore, it carried no radio or distress flares, and its lifesaving aids were rudimentary.

By 1966 "Darlwyne" was in the ownership of John Barratt of <a href="Penryn%2C%20Cornwall">Penryn</a> in Cornwall. The fatal voyage was arranged when the boat's skipper, Brian Bown, agreed to take a group of guests from the Greatwood guest house in <a href="Mylor%2C%20Cornwall">Mylor</a> on a sea trip to <a href="Fowey">Fowey</a>. On the morning of 31 July the outward voyage was completed without mishap, but the weather subsequently deteriorated. Bown disregarded advice to remain in Fowey harbour, and shortly after 4:00 pm began the return trip to Mylor. An unconfirmed sighting at around 6:00 pm placed the boat, in worsening conditions, in the vicinity of <a href="Dodman%20Point">Dodman Point</a>, a prominent coastal feature. Following its failure to arrive at Mylor the alarm was raised early on 1 August, and full air and sea searches began at dawn. After the recovery of 12 bodies, searches continued intermittently for several months, without finding traces of the vessel.

A <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> enquiry into "Darlwyne"s loss placed the main blame on Barratt and Bown for allowing the vessel to go to sea in an unsafe and unprepared condition. Bown was lost in the disaster; Barratt was censured and ordered to contribute £500 to the cost of the enquiry. The Board's report exposed the laxity with which boat licensing regulations were being administered, and led to stiffer penalties for non-compliance, but there were no immediate regulatory changes, and no criminal proceedings were recommended. In April 1967 a memorial screen, listing the names of the 31 dead, was dedicated in Mylor church at a special service led by the <a href="Maurice%20Key">Bishop of Truro</a>. In 2016, on the 50th anniversary of the sinking, divers found an anchor and other debris at a location close to Dodman Point, which they stated were in all probability "Darlwyne" relics.

Picket boat no. 41768, the future "Darlwyne", was built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in 1941 in the Sussex Yacht Works yard at <a href="Shoreham-by-Sea">Shoreham-by-Sea</a>. The hull, <a href="Carvel%20%28boat%20building%29">carvel built</a> from African <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> and <a href="Ulmus%20thomasii">rock elm</a>, was long, approximately wide, with a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> at the stern of . <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">Bulkheads</a> divided the hull into fully watertight compartments, each equipped with a <a href="bilge%20pump">bilge pump</a>. The vessel's original engine power was provided by twin <a href="L.%20Gardner%20and%20Sons">Gardner</a> 6LW <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>s, each developing 95 <a href="horsepower">horsepower</a>. It was built to operate in harbours and estuaries, mainly in transferring personnel between ship and shore, rather than for the open sea.

The vessel remained with the Royal Navy until 1957, when it was sold to the Belsize Boatyard in <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>. Here, it was converted to a cabin cruiser, during which most of the original bulkheads were removed; the replacements were not watertight. In September 1959 the boatyard sold the boat to joint owners Messrs Lowe and Gray, who replaced the engines with less powerful twin <a href="Perkins%20Engines">Perkins P6 units</a> each generating 65 hp. They then moved the boat to <a href="Teddington">Teddington</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>, where on 22 April 1960 it was registered as a river cruiser under the name "Darlwyne". At this time its <a href="gross%20register%20tonnage">gross register tonnage</a> was recorded as 12.35.

In October 1962 the owners transferred "Darlwyne" to <a href="St%20Mawes">St Mawes</a>, in <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Cornwall">Falmouth Harbour</a>, <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. It was taken there by a crew of six; although the sea trip was accomplished without any serious incident, the crew were critical of the boat's performance in certain weather conditions. They found it top-heavy, difficult to steer, and with a tendency to <a href="Angle%20of%20list">list</a>. "Darlwyne" remained at St Mawes until September 1963, when the owners decided to sell it as a potential commercial passenger boat. At <a href="Mylor%2C%20Cornwall">Mylor</a>, in the <a href="Carrick%20Roads">Carrick Roads</a> estuary of the <a href="River%20Fal">River Fal</a>, it was inspected by a local marine surveyor, George Corke. He noted the poor steering—it was impossible, he said, to navigate a straight course—and thought that much work would be necessary before it was fit for passenger-carrying operations. On 30 May 1964 Corke acted as agent for Lowe and Gray in the sale of "Darlwyne" to John Barratt of <a href="Penryn%2C%20Cornwall">Penryn</a>, whose main objective was to renovate the vessel with a view to a profitable sale.

After extensive work and repainting, in September 1965 Barratt agreed to sell "Darlwyne" to Steven Gifford, who took possession and began further adaptations. The sale ultimately fell through, and by the end of the year the vessel had been returned to Barratt. In the spring and early summer of 1966, under the supervision of Barratt's daughter, further substantial alterations were carried out, including the removal of the aft cabin to create an open cockpit area. This work, undertaken without professional advice, was never fully completed. During this period the boat was in regular use for trips by members of the Barratt family, including a <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a>tide voyage across Falmouth Bay to the <a href="Helford%20River">Helford River</a>, where it apparently performed well in strong winds.

At the beginning of July 1966, "Darlwyne" made several commercial sightseeing trips around Falmouth Harbour during Falmouth's Tall Ships regatta. A passenger on one of these sorties was Brian Michael Bown, a former member of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Marine%20Branch">RAF Marine Rescue Section</a>. Although not formally qualified as a ship's master, Bown had sailing experience and had skippered boats on seagoing trips to <a href="Fowey">Fowey</a> and the <a href="Isles%20of%20Scilly">Isles of Scilly</a>. Subsequently, Bown suggested to Barratt a business venture in which "Darlwyne" would be used as a day-trip boat. Bown's letters indicate that he was proposing to work as the boat's skipper, and to take a third share of the profits. Barratt's daughter advised Bown that they were preparing "Darlwyne" as "a twelve-passenger charter boat"; any number in excess of 12 would mean conforming with tougher <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> regulations, and licensing might prove difficult. According to Barratt, Bown was to assume responsibility for obtaining whatever licences were necessary. Barratt later claimed that Bown had bought the boat outright, but there is no documentation of this supposed purchase, nor did Barratt mention it to anyone else.

On 20 July 1966, at the request of Barratt's daughter, "Darlwyne" was again examined by George Corke, who found the boat in generally poor condition. Among the faults he listed were dry rot, a weakening of the hull caused by the removal of various supporting frames, and signs that the hull had been "pushed in" below the waterline. Corke's report reiterated his earlier view that "Darlwyne" was presently unfit for work in the open sea. This report was sent not to Barratt but to the family's solicitors, where in the days that followed it lay unread; there is no indication that Barratt was aware of its contents before 31 July.

Robert Rainbird, proprietor of the Greatwood guest house at <a href="Mylor%20Creek">Mylor Creek</a>, near Falmouth, was familiar with "Darlwyne", having cruised with Bown in one of the earlier Tall Ships sailings. According to his later account, when two of his guests asked him about the possibility of organising a sea excursion, he put them in touch with Bown. On the evening of Saturday 30 July, amid celebrations following England's victory in the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">1966 FIFA World Cup Final</a>, Bown and his friend Jeffrey Stock, a qualified engineer, visited Greatwood. They found that enthusiasm for a sea trip had spread to many of the guests, and an agreement was made to take a large party to Fowey the following day. Different accounts were given later of the financial basis for the proposed hire – whether it was to be a fixed charge or a rate per head is uncertain.

Barratt, the boat's legal owner, professed ignorance of the arrangements made at Greatwood, believing, he said, that Bown had gone there to discuss with Rainbird future charter work once the necessary licences had been obtained. Under local regulations, a licence for carrying up to 12 passengers was subject to examination of the boat by the harbourmaster, who would also require the person in charge to be a licensed skipper. Vessels proposing to carry more than 12 passengers needed a licensed master, a qualified marine engineer, and a Class III Passenger Certificate from the Board of Trade. This certificate was only granted to vessels in good condition with watertight hull compartments, a two-way radio, a qualified radio operator and a range of safety devices. "Darlwyne" had no radio, no distress flares, and carried only two <a href="lifebelt">lifebelt</a>s. Bown had apparently begun enquiries with the Falmouth Harbour Commission, but neither he nor "Darlwyne" possessed any of the licences needed for the boat to operate commercially.

In accordance with the arrangement made the previous day, early on Sunday 31 July Bown and Stock brought "Darlwyne" to Mylor Creek. The Greatwood party comprised, in all, twenty-six guests, one member of staff on her day off, and two children of another staff member. Eight of the party were children. "Darlwyne" anchored offshore, and the passengers were rowed out in two dinghies, one of which was hauled aboard and stored on <a href="davit">davit</a>s, the other attached by a <a href="Painter%20%28rope%29">painter</a> to "Darlwyne"s stern.

BBC weather forecasts for the Cornwall area, broadcast the previous evening and earlier that morning, were discouraging; all promised increasing winds, up to <a href="Beaufort%20Scale">Force 7</a>, with the probability of rain from midday. Such weather conditions could produce heavy seas and poor visibility. Nevertheless, "Darlwyne" set out from Mylor shortly after 10:00 am in pleasant sunshine, expecting to return before 7:00 pm. The journey to Fowey, which included a slight detour to view <a href="Mevagissey">Mevagissey</a> harbour, was completed without incident, and the party arrived in Fowey just after 1:00 pm. By this time the weather had deteriorated, and it was raining heavily. Bown did not tie up to the main town quay – he was heard saying that the vessel was "a bitch to handle" – and anchored mid-harbour, again using the dinghies to land the party.

After three hours in the town, the group reassembled at the quay to be ferried back to "Darlwyne". The wind was rising; a bystander heard a local fisherman advise Bown not to leave the harbour until the weather improved, but the warning was brushed aside. "Darlwyne" sailed at approximately 4:10 pm, and headed westward into the worsening weather. For the first few miles the large headland known as <a href="Dodman%20Point">Dodman Point</a> would provide some shelter; thereafter the vessel would be fully exposed to the force of the winds.
There were several possible sightings of "Darlwyne" on its homeward voyage. Outside Fowey Harbour in the vicinity of the Cannis Buoy a fisherman watched a vessel towing a dinghy pass by; soon afterwards another fisherman saw a boat off Meanease Point, close to Dodman Point, but did not notice a dinghy being towed astern. At about 5:45 pm a farmer whose land overlooked the sea to the west of Dodman Point saw a launch running close to <a href="Hemmick%20Beach">Hemmick Beach</a>, moving westward. He could see people in the stern area, and there were no evident signs of distress. A short while later an observer in the village of <a href="Portloe">Portloe</a> saw a cabin cruiser somewhere between Dodman Point and Nare Head, moving in the direction of Falmouth. This was the last recorded possible sighting. By this time winds had strengthened to Force 6, with waves reaching amid increasing rain and flying spray.

In the late afternoon a holidaymaker reported seeing four people apparently stranded on Diamond Rock, a semi-submerged reef off Porthluney Cove, west of Dodman Point. The police were informed, but at that time "Darlwyne" was not overdue, and thus there was no reason to connect these people with those on the boat. This incident was not referred to in the subsequent searches, nor in the later Board of Trade enquiry which fixed the most likely time of sinking much later in the evening.

At around 7:00 pm, Barratt's son-in-law Christopher Mitchell noticed that "Darlwyne" had not returned to its Penryn moorings. Having ascertained that the vessel was not at Greatwood House, Mitchell asked for news at the Falmouth coastguard station shortly before 7:30. The duty coastguard, Seagar, had no record of "Darlwyne"s departure that morning, and was unaware of its present whereabouts. At this time there was no particular cause for alarm, and Seager did not record the enquiry. Mitchell assumed the boat might be sheltering in a harbour or estuary, but further enquiries among local acquaintances brought no further information.

Later that evening, Rainbird telephoned Seagar and expressed concern at "Darlwyne"s non-arrival. As the call was not recorded, its timing is uncertain; it may have been around 8:00, but possibly as late as 9:30. Seager advised Rainbird to contact the coastguard stations on the Fowey–Falmouth route for news of "Darlwyne", and asked him to report back any information. From his enquiries Rainbird established from the <a href="Polruan">Polruan</a> station that "Darlwyne" had left Fowey shortly after 4:00pm that afternoon. He later claimed that he had passed this information to the Falmouth coastguards at about 10:15 pm. Seager denied receiving any such call before his duty stint ended at 11:00 pm, and did not mention the concerns about the missing "Darlwyne" to Coastguard Beard, his relief. Beard heard of the likely emergency for the first time at 2:45 am on Monday 1 August when Rainbird, by now seriously worried, rang the coastguard station. Beard then informed his district officer, who authorised a full-scale coastal search for the missing vessel to begin at daybreak.

At 5:34 am on Monday 1 August a warning message to shipping in the area was broadcast by the BBC. At 5:37 the Falmouth lifeboat was launched, followed a few minutes later by the Fowey lifeboat. At 6:45 a coastguard helicopter began a coastal search between Fowey and Falmouth, covering a distance of five miles out to sea. It was joined at 9:45 by an <a href="Avro%20Shackleton">Avro Shackleton</a> aircraft supplied by the <a href="RAF%20Search%20and%20Rescue%20Force">RAF Search and Rescue Force</a>, which extended the search area further south, west and east. Later, two <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships, and , participated in the sea search. At about 1:25pm the <a href="Tanker%20%28ship%29">tanker</a> "Esso Caernarvon" found the dinghy that had been towed by "Darlwyne", about south of Dolman Point and about from the <a href="Eddystone%20Lighthouse">Eddystone Lighthouse</a>. The dinghy, empty but undamaged, was picked up by an <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> launch and brought to Falmouth.

Amid rising anxiety ashore, there was still hope that "Darlwyne" remained afloat. Barratt's daughter believed the vessel to be "completely seaworthy", while Rainbird surmised that it might have drifted southwards, out of fuel or with incapacitated engines, towards the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a>. The <a href="coxswain">coxswain</a> of the Fowey lifeboat said, after 15 hours of searching, that "there was nothing to suggest that a boat had been wrecked out there". Others were more sceptical: Steve Gifford, who had briefly owned the boat, was appalled that 31 people were aboard a vessel that was simply not strong enough to meet the heavy seas it must have encountered, and thought it likely she would have broken up and sank very quickly. This view was shared by Corke, the surveyor, who felt that "Darlwyne" was not seaworthy for the weather conditions that developed while it was at sea.

Searches by helicopter, Shackleton aircraft and lifeboats continued on 2 August, but were called off around mid-day due to poor visibility and adverse weather conditions. At the insistence of Rainbird, who argued that there was as yet no direct evidence that "Darlwyne" had sunk, the searches were resumed that evening. They continued into the following day, when they were joined by three <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon%20Rapide">de Havilland Dragon Rapide</a> aircraft, privately hired by friends of one of the missing families. The Rapides covered a sea area of , extending to the Channel Islands, before returning to Cornwall on 4 August without finding any trace of the missing vessel.

"Darlwyne"s possible fate was raised in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> on 2 August when members, while expressing the hope that survivors would be found, were concerned about the apparent lack of enforcement of regulations that should have prevented an overloaded, unlicensed craft from putting out to sea. The following day, the Cornish MP <a href="Peter%20Bessell">Peter Bessell</a> was highly critical of the delay in commencing the search until long after it was clear that "Darlwyne" was overdue. He cited "expert opinion" that the craft was in all probability still afloat, and described the search activity thus far as "totally inadequate". This allegation was strongly denied by the Air Force minister <a href="Merlyn%20Rees">Merlyn Rees</a>, who maintained that there had been no lack of urgency and that everything possible had been and was still being done.

On 4 August the first victims from "Darlwyne" were discovered in the sea about four miles east of Dodman Point. The bodies were of Albert Russell, his wife Margaret, and two teenage girls: Susan Tassell and Amanda Hicks. The first three were brought ashore by the Falmouth lifeboat, the fourth by the Fowey lifeboat. On 5 August the body of Jean Brock was found, wearing a lifebelt, six miles west of the Eddystone lighthouse. That same day, light wreckage—planking from the on-board dinghy, an engine cover, a plastic ball and some sun tan lotion—was found on a beach near <a href="Polperro">Polperro</a>.

On 8 August two more bodies—Margaret Wright and Susan Cowan—were found about eight miles from the Eddystone Lighthouse. Patricia Russell and Eileen Tassell were found two days later, off <a href="Looe%20Island">Looe Island</a> and <a href="Wembury">the Mew Stone</a> respectively. The body of nine-year-old Janice Mills was washed ashore at <a href="Whitsand%20Bay">Whitsand Bay</a> on 11 August, and that of her eleven-year-old brother David was discovered at Downderry Beach, between Fowey and <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, on 13 August. The twelfth and final body to be recovered was of Arthur Mills, found in the sea about 10 miles south of Plymouth.

The subsequent post-mortems established that all the victims had drowned in deep water, suggesting that they had gone down with the vessel rather than after struggling on the surface. An analysis of the times shown on various watches found on the victims suggested that the sinking had probably taken place around 9:00 pm on 31 July, and thus that "Darlwyne" was afloat for around three hours after the last tentative sighting.

When the first bodies were brought into Falmouth by the local lifeboat, the quays were lined with hundreds of people who watched in silence as the victims were landed and taken away in hearses. All commercial activity in the harbour was suspended; the royal yacht , at anchor on a visit to the port, removed its ceremonial bunting and dipped the <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a> as a mark of respect. The crowds returned to the harbour on 7 August for the town's annual lifeboat service; that year the occasion became a memorial service for "Darlwyne"s lost party.

In the days and weeks that followed, relatives and friends of the victims took the bodies for private burial and collected the abandoned belongings from Greatwood. The sea search for the "Darlwyne" wreck continued through the autumn and winter and into 1967, led by . This navy minesweeper, equipped with the latest sonar equipment, carried out exhaustive searches in the area around Dodman Point, thought to be the vessel's most likely resting place. Although more than 600 dives were carried out, no sign of "Darlwyne" was discovered. In December 1966 the navy storeship HMS "Maxim" investigated the seabed around Looe, after reports that a trawler had caught on an unidentified object and lost its nets.

The Board of Trade court of enquiry into the loss of the "Darlwyne" began at the Old County Hall, <a href="Truro">Truro</a> on 13 December 1966. It sat until 6 January 1967, and published its findings in March of that year. It was unable to determine who was responsible for organising the fatal trip, as most of those involved had lost their lives in the disaster. Barratt claimed ignorance, and Rainbird denied any role in the matter beyond introducing Bown to the guests who had asked about a sea trip. In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary, the court assumed that details had probably been finalised in the Greatwood bar, between Bown and the two guests who had initiated the request.

The court established that at the time of the disaster, neither "Darlwyne" nor Bown were licensed in terms of either Board of Trade or local regulations for passenger-carrying vessels. The court believed that both Barratt and Bown were broadly aware of licensing requirements, but had taken few or no practical steps towards compliance by 31 July.

Evidence of "Darlwyne"s history confirmed Barratt as its legal owner. The court noted the general state of the vessel and the various alterations that had been carried out, affecting its seaworthiness. In particular, the cockpit floor was not watertight and had inadequate <a href="scupper">scupper</a>s, so that water entering the cockpit drained into the lower hull rather than back into the sea. Lacking watertight bulkheads, the hull would easily flood with any rapid ingress of water. The hull itself showed evidence of dry rot and other external damage. Poor communication between the various parties concerned with the vessel in the preceding months meant that these various shortcomings had been overlooked or ignored. Furthermore, the overloading of the vessel with 31 people meant that it lay low in the water, so that a modest <a href="Sailing%23Heeling">heel</a> of 30 degrees would allow water into the open cockpit.

The court heard details of "Darlwyne"s departure from Fowey, the prevailing weather conditions on 31 July, and the subsequent possible sightings. It thought it likely that some time after 6:00 pm the engines failed, leaving the vessel to drift helplessly. Without radio or flares, Bown would have been unable to signal its distress. From the evidence of the stopped watches and the pathologist's reports of death by drowning in deep water, the court decided that it was likely that, around 9:00 pm, "Darlwyne" had been overwhelmed by heavy seas. Because of its structural faults it had filled with water and sunk rapidly, taking the entire complement down.

Different testimonies were given about the number and timing of phone calls to the Falmouth coastguard station on the evening of 31 July, giving rise to a view that searches could have begun earlier. The court strongly recommended that in future, all messages received by coastguard stations relating to vessels should be recorded and logged. It was, however, satisfied that all searches had been thoroughly carried out. It did not feel that the supposed delay in beginning the searches was significant, as there was no information available that would have justified action before 9:00 pm, by which time the disaster had in all probability already happened.

In determining responsibility for "Darlwyne"s loss, the court was "satisfied that the major cause of the disaster was the "Darlwyne" going on a voyage to sea when she was physically unfit to withstand the normal perils which she might expect to meet". Culpability was shared between Bown and Barratt, the former for taking passengers to sea in an unfit boat, the latter for failing to warn his "agent or servant" of the vessel's unfit state. Barratt was severely censured by the court, and ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the enquiry. Barratt considered the court's findings as related to him were "rather unfair", while Bown's widow defended her late husband as a competent and experienced skipper. Rainbird declared himself vindicated.

On 9 April 1967, at the parish church of St Mylor, the <a href="Maurice%20Key">Bishop of Truro</a> led a service of dedication for a memorial screen, erected in the church to commemorate the victims of the "Darlwyne" disaster. The screen, designed by John Phillips and fashioned from oak by local craftsmen, contains the names of all the lost 31.

After the Board of Trade report was published, the coroner reopened the inquests, which had been adjourned pending any recommendations from the enquiry for criminal proceedings. No criminal responsibility was established; verdicts of death by misadventure were recorded in each case. The coroner expressed the wish that, as a result of the tragedy, regulations concerning licences would be much more strictly enforced. In this he echoed the Board of Trade report, which had stated that regulations relating to boat licensing "date from the Victorian era", and were wholly inadequate in modern conditions. The Falmouth harbourmaster had told the enquiry that, without further staff, it would be impossible to check all the boats in the harbour; furthermore, he said, the £5 maximum fine for operating an unlicensed boat was not a deterrent. In Parliament on 15 March 1967 the trade minister <a href="Joseph%20Mallalieu">Joseph Mallalieu</a> said that he had no plans to introduce further legislation for the licensing of pleasure boats plying for hire, but proposed to increase the penalties for infringement of existing regulations.

Although the tragedy was keenly felt in Cornwall, its national impact, given the heavy loss of life, was relatively small, perhaps because it occurred during the post World Cup euphoria when public attention and headlines were directed elsewhere. No clues to "Darlwyne"s fate emerged for decades. In July 2016, divers working with a BBC documentary team investigating the tragedy examined seabed locations closer to Dodman Point than the original searches. According to local fishermen, debris had been recovered from this area in the 1980s, including a wooden <a href="Transom%20%28nautical%29">transom</a> bearing the name "Darlwyne". After several searches that revealed nothing, the 2016 divers found artefacts including an anchor, a winch, items of ballast, and the remains of a davit. No other recent wrecks or disappearances had been recorded in the area. "Taking everything into account", the divers reported, "it’s likely that what we found was what was left of the Darlwyne". On this basis several media sources reported that the mystery had been solved.

The victims, with their ages, are listed by Martin Banks in his 2014 history of the event as follows:

British hydrogen bomb programme

The British hydrogen bomb programme was the ultimately successful British effort to develop <a href="hydrogen%20bombs">hydrogen bombs</a> between 1952 and 1958. During the early part of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Britain had a <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a> project, codenamed <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a>. At the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quebec Conference</a> in August 1943, British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and U.S. President <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> signed the <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a>, merging Tube Alloys into the American <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, which many of Britain's top scientists <a href="British%20contribution%20to%20the%20Manhattan%20Project">participated in</a>. The British government trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery, but the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a> (also known as the McMahon Act) ended technical cooperation. Fearing a resurgence of American isolationism, and the loss of Britain's <a href="great%20power">great power</a> status, the British government resumed its own development effort, which was codenamed "<a href="High%20Explosive%20Research">High Explosive Research</a>".

The successful <a href="nuclear%20test">nuclear test</a> of a British atomic bomb in <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">Operation Hurricane</a> in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement. Britain became the world's <a href="nuclear%20powers">third nuclear power</a>, reaffirming the country's status as a great power, but hopes that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to restore the nuclear <a href="Special%20Relationship">Special Relationship</a> were soon dashed. In November 1952, the United States conducted the <a href="Ivy%20Mike">first successful test</a> of a true <a href="thermonuclear%20weapon">thermonuclear device</a> or hydrogen bomb. Britain was therefore still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology. The Defence Policy Committee, chaired by Churchill and consisting of the senior <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> members, considered the political and strategic implications in June 1954, and concluded that "we must maintain and strengthen our position as a world power so that Her Majesty's Government can exercise a powerful influence in the counsels of the world." In July 1954, Cabinet agreed to proceed with the development of thermonuclear weapons.

The scientists at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Atomic%20Energy%20Authority">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a>'s <a href="Atomic%20Weapons%20Establishment">Atomic Weapons Establishment</a> at <a href="Aldermaston">Aldermaston</a> in Berkshire included <a href="William%20Penney">William Penney</a>, <a href="William%20Richard%20Joseph%20Cook">William Cook</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Allen%20%28physicist%29">Ken Allen</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Curran">Samuel Curran</a>, <a href="Henry%20Hulme">Henry Hulme</a>, <a href="John%20Bryan%20Taylor">Bryan Taylor</a> and <a href="John%20Clive%20Ward">John Ward</a>. They did not know how to build a hydrogen bomb, but produced three designs: <a href="Orange%20Herald">Orange Herald</a>, a large <a href="boosted%20fission%20weapon">boosted fission weapon</a>; <a href="Green%20Bamboo">Green Bamboo</a>, an interim thermonuclear design; and <a href="Green%20Granite">Green Granite</a>, a true thermonuclear design. The first series of <a href="Operation%20Grapple">Operation Grapple</a> tests involved Britain's first airdrop of a thermonuclear bomb. Although hailed as a success at the time, the first test of the Green Granite design was a failure. The second test validated Orange Herald as a usable design of a megaton weapon, but it was not a thermonuclear bomb, and the core boosting did not work. A third test attempted to correct the Green Granite design, but was another failure.

In the Grapple X test in November 1957, they successfully tested a thermonuclear design. The Grapple Y test the following April obtained most of its <a href="nuclear%20weapon%20yield">yield</a> from <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>, and the Grapple Z test series later that year demonstrated a mastery of thermonuclear weapons technology. An international moratorium on nuclear tests commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased atmospheric testing for good. The successful development of the hydrogen bomb, along with the <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>, resulted in the <a href="1958%20US%E2%80%93UK%20Mutual%20Defence%20Agreement">1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement</a>, in which the nuclear Special Relationship was restored.

The <a href="neutron">neutron</a> was discovered by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> at the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in February 1932, and in April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Walton">Ernest Walton</a> split <a href="lithium">lithium</a> atoms with accelerated <a href="proton">proton</a>s. In December 1938, <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> at Hahn's laboratory in <a href="Berlin-Dahlem">Berlin-Dahlem</a> bombarded <a href="uranium">uranium</a> with slow neutrons, and discovered that <a href="barium">barium</a> had been produced, and therefore that the uranium <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> had been split. Hahn wrote to his colleague <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>, who, with her nephew <a href="Otto%20Robert%20Frisch">Otto Robert Frisch</a>, developed a theoretical explanation of the process. By analogy with the <a href="Fission%20%28biology%29">division of biological cells</a>, they named the process "<a href="nuclear%20fission">fission</a>".

The discovery of fission raised the possibility that an extremely powerful <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> could be created. Frisch and <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a>, both German refugee scientists working in Britain, calculated the <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of a metallic sphere of pure <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a>, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as would suffice, and would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite. The <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a> was established to investigate further. It reported that an atomic bomb was technically feasible, and recommended pursuing its development as a matter of urgency. A new directorate known as <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> was created to coordinate this effort. Sir <a href="John%20Anderson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Waverley">John Anderson</a>, the <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a>, became the minister responsible, and <a href="Wallace%20Akers">Wallace Akers</a> from <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.

In July 1940, Britain offered the United States access to its scientific research, and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments. He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by <a href="atomic%20spies">atomic spies</a> for the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

The United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart. The British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but it would require overwhelming priority, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">war in Europe</a>. At the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quebec Conference</a> in August 1943, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, and the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a>, signed the <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a>, which merged the two national projects. The Quebec Agreement established the <a href="Combined%20Policy%20Committee">Combined Policy Committee</a> and the <a href="Combined%20Development%20Trust">Combined Development Trust</a> to coordinate their efforts. The 19 September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.

A British mission led by Akers assisted in the development of <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> technology at the <a href="SAM%20Laboratories">SAM Laboratories</a> in New York. Another, headed by <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, assisted with the <a href="electromagnetic%20separation">electromagnetic separation</a> process at the <a href="Berkeley%20Radiation%20Laboratory">Berkeley Radiation Laboratory</a>. Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian <a href="Montreal%20Laboratory">Montreal Laboratory</a>. A British mission to the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.

With the end of the war the <a href="Special%20Relationship">Special Relationship</a> between Britain and the United States became, in the words of <a href="Margaret%20Gowing">Margaret Gowing</a>, "very much less special". The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which it considered a joint discovery. On 8 August 1945 the Prime Minister, <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, sent a message to President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> in which he referred to both of them as "heads of the Governments which have control of this great force".

On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</a>, <a href="Mackenzie%20King">Mackenzie King</a>, went to Washington, D.C., to confer with Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. A Memorandum of Intention they signed replaced the Quebec Agreement. The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes were soon disappointed. The <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a> (McMahon Act), which was signed into law by Truman on 1 August 1946, ended technical cooperation. Its control of "restricted data" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information.

This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist <a href="Alan%20Nunn%20May">Alan Nunn May</a>, who had worked in the Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. It was but the first of a series of spy scandals. The arrest of <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a> in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28spy%29">Donald Maclean</a>, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British security arrangements. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.

Attlee set up a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20cabinet%20committee">cabinet sub-committee</a>, the <a href="Gen%2075%20Committee">Gen 75 Committee</a> (known informally by Attlee as the "Atomic Bomb Committee"), on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of an independent British nuclear weapons programme. The <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> considered the issue of nuclear weapons in July 1946, and recommended that Britain acquire them. A <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a> and <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>-processing facility was approved by the Gen 75 committee on 18 December 1945 "with the highest urgency and importance". The decision to proceed was formally made on 8 January 1947 at a meeting of Gen 163, another cabinet subcommittee, and was publicly announced in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> on 12 May 1948. <a href="D%20notice">D notice</a> No. 25 forbid the publication of details on the design, construction or location of atomic weapons. The project was given the cover name "High Explosive Research".

Production facilities were constructed under the direction of <a href="Christopher%20Hinton%2C%20Baron%20Hinton%20of%20Bankside">Christopher Hinton</a>, who established his headquarters in a former <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20Factory">Royal Ordnance Factory</a> at <a href="ROF%20Risley">Risley</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. These included a uranium metal plant at <a href="Springfields">Springfields</a>, nuclear reactors and a plutonium processing plant at <a href="Windscale">Windscale</a>, and a gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment facility at <a href="Capenhurst">Capenhurst</a>, near <a href="Chester">Chester</a>. Uranium ore was stockpiled at Springfields. As the American nuclear programme expanded, its requirements became greater than the production of the existing mines. To gain access to the stockpile, they reopened negotiations, which resulted in the 1948 "<a href="Modus%20Vivendi">Modus Vivendi</a>", which allowed for consultation on the use of nuclear weapons, and limited sharing of technical information.

As Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, pronounced "Caesar"), Penney directed bomb design from <a href="Fort%20Halstead">Fort Halstead</a>. In 1951 his design group moved to a new site at <a href="Atomic%20Weapons%20Establishment">Aldermaston</a> in Berkshire. The first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">Operation Hurricane</a> on 3 October 1952. Britain thereby became the third country to test nuclear weapons. The first <a href="Blue%20Danube%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Blue Danube</a> atomic bombs were delivered to <a href="Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> in November 1953, although the <a href="V%20bombers">V bombers</a> to deliver them were not available until 1955. In the meantime, nuclear deterrence was provided by the United States <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a>, which had begun operating from British bases in 1949.

The successful test of an atomic bomb represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power, reaffirming its status as a <a href="great%20power">great power</a>, but hopes that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to restore the Special Relationship were soon dashed. On 1 November 1952, the United States conducted <a href="Ivy%20Mike">Ivy Mike</a>, the first successful test of a true <a href="thermonuclear%20weapon">thermonuclear device</a> (also known as a hydrogen bomb). Due to its physical size and use of <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> liquid <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a>, it was not suitable for use as a deliverable weapon, but the <a href="Castle%20Bravo">Castle Bravo</a> test on 1 March 1954 used a much smaller device with solid <a href="lithium%20deuteride">lithium deuteride</a>. Boosted by the <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reaction in <a href="lithium-7">lithium-7</a>, the <a href="nuclear%20weapon%20yield">yield</a> of was more than twice what had been expected, and indeed was the largest detonation the Americans would ever carry out. This resulted in widespread <a href="radioactive%20fallout">radioactive fallout</a> that affected 28 Americans, 236 Marshall Islanders, and the 23 crewmen of a Japanese fishing boat, the "<a href="Daigo%20Fukury%C5%AB%20Maru">Daigo Fukuryū Maru</a>" ("Lucky Dragon No. 5"). Meanwhile, the Soviet Union tested <a href="Joe%204">Joe 4</a>, a <a href="boosted%20fission%20weapon">boosted fission weapon</a> with a yield of on 12 August 1953. This was followed by <a href="Joe%2019">Joe 19</a>, a true two-stage thermonuclear weapon on 20 November 1954.

Although the British Hurricane device was more advanced than the American <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a> bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology, and while British and Soviet advances had taken much of the heat out of American opposition to renewed cooperation with the British, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> saw little benefit in it for the United States. The McMahon Act was amended by the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201954">Atomic Energy Act of 1954</a> on 30 August, which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations, but it fell far short of what the British government wanted. Churchill, who had replaced Attlee as prime minister, turned to Lord Cherwell for advice on the prospect of producing a British hydrogen bomb. Cherwell reported that "We think we know how to make an H-bomb", but Penney did not agree with this sanguine assessment.

A New Weapons Committee was established at Aldermaston on 15 October 1951 to examine improvements to their atomic bombs. <a href="John%20Corner">John Corner</a>, the head of the theoretical group at Aldermaston, suggested producing a device in the "megaton range"—one with a yield of or more. In this he was thinking not of a thermonuclear weapon, but of a large fission one. The idea was not pursued at that time, because the RAF wanted more, not bigger, atomic bombs. Meeting in <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> in December 1953 with <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, who had replaced Truman as president earlier that year, Churchill told him that the RAF had reckoned that fission bombs would be sufficient for most targets, and therefore that Britain had no intention of developing hydrogen bombs.
On 12 and 19 March 1954, Penney briefed the Gen 475 Committee meetings, attended by the Chiefs of Staff, senior officials from the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> and <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a>, and Sir <a href="Edwin%20Plowden">Edwin Plowden</a>, about recent developments in thermonuclear weapons. Sir <a href="Frederick%20Brundrett">Frederick Brundrett</a>, the chairman of the Chiefs of Staff's Working Party on the Operational Use of Atomic Weapons (OAW), then asked Penney on 25 May for a working paper for an OAW meeting on 31 May. In turn, OAW sent a report to the Chiefs of Staff, who recommended that the United Kingdom develop its own thermonuclear weapons. <a href="Admiral%20of%20the%20Fleet%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral of the Fleet</a> Sir <a href="Rhoderick%20McGrigor">Rhoderick McGrigor</a>, the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a>, recalled that:

There was another political consideration. The "Lucky Dragon" incident had touched off a storm of protest, and there were calls from <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>s and the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> for a moratorium on nuclear testing, resulting in an acrimonious debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new <a href="Eisenhower%20administration">Eisenhower administration</a> in the United States looked favourably on the idea of a moratorium, and the <a href="Foreign%20Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a>. The United States had now finished its <a href="Operation%20Castle">Operation Castle</a> series of tests, and such a moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; but it would also lock the United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.

The Defence Policy Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister and consisting of the senior Cabinet members, considered the political and strategic implications on 1 June, and concluded that "we must maintain and strengthen our position as a world power so that Her Majesty's Government can exercise a powerful influence in the counsels of the world." Churchill informed Cabinet of the decision on 7 July 1954, and they were not happy about not being consulted, particularly the <a href="Lord%20Privy%20Seal">Lord Privy Seal</a>, <a href="Harry%20Crookshank">Harry Crookshank</a>. Cabinet debated the matter that day and the next, before postponing a final decision. On 27 July 1954, the Lord President of the Council, the <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Marquess of Salisbury</a>, raised the matter, although it was not on the agenda, stressing the need for a decision. This time Cabinet agreed to proceed with the development of thermonuclear weapons.

Churchill's return to the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's return to the post of <a href="Paymaster%20General">Paymaster General</a>. He was a strong supporter of the atomic energy programme, but while he agreed with its size and scope, he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with <a href="Civil%20Service%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Service</a> pay and conditions, which were below those for comparable workers in industry. <a href="HM%20Treasury">The Treasury</a> had agreed to flexibility in exceptional cases, but the procedure was absurdly slow. Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared to those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring <a href="Frank%20Kearton%2C%20Baron%20Kearton">Frank Kearton</a> in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton. Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing that responsibility for the program be transferred from the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a> to an Atomic Energy Commission.

Cherwell managed to persuade Churchill to propose to Cabinet that a small committee be established to examine the matter. Cabinet agreed at a meeting in November 1952, and the committee was created, chaired by Crookshank. Cabinet accepted its recommendations in April 1953, and another committee was established under Anderson (now Lord Waverley) to make recommendations on the implementation of the new organisation and its structure. The Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954 created the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Atomic%20Energy%20Authority">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> (UKAEA) on 19 July 1954. Plowden became its first chairman. His fellow board members were Hinton, who was in charge of the Industrial Group at Risley; Cockcroft, who headed the Research Group at Harwell; and Penney, who led the Weapons Group at Aldermaston. The UKAEA initially reported to Salisbury in his capacity as Lord President of the Council; later in the decade the UKAEA would report directly to the Prime Minister. Over 20,000 staff transferred to the UKAEA; by the end of the decade, their numbers had grown to nearly 41,000.

Like Hinton, Penney had difficulty recruiting and retaining the highly skilled staff he needed. In particular, he wanted a deputy with a strong scientific background. An approach to <a href="B.%20V.%20Bowden%2C%20Baron%20Bowden">Vivian Bowden</a> failed. After Penney repeatedly asked for <a href="William%20Richard%20Joseph%20Cook">William Cook</a>, Salisbury managed to persuade McGrigor to release Cook from the Admiralty to be Penney's deputy. Cook commenced work at Aldermaston on 1 September 1954. <a href="Henry%20Hulme">Henry Hulme</a> joined in 1954. He was too senior to be placed in Corner's theoretical physics division, so he became an assistant to Penney, with special responsibility for the hydrogen bomb programme. Samuel Curran, who had worked on the Manhattan Project in Berkeley, became head of the radiation measurements division. The physicist <a href="John%20Clive%20Ward">John Ward</a> was also recruited at this time.

British knowledge of thermonuclear weapons was based on work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference there on the Super (as it was then called) in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American <a href="Operation%20Greenhouse">Operation Greenhouse</a> George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 "Modus Vivendi". Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston: <a href="Orange%20Herald">Orange Herald</a>, under <a href="John%20Bryan%20Taylor">Bryan Taylor</a>, a large boosted fission weapon; <a href="Green%20Bamboo">Green Bamboo</a>, an interim thermonuclear design similar to the Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and <a href="Green%20Granite">Green Granite</a>, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald would be the first British weapon to incorporate an <a href="external%20neutron%20initiator">external neutron initiator</a>.

For Green Granite, Penney proposed a design based on <a href="radiation%20implosion">radiation implosion</a> and staging. There would be three stages, which he called Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission device. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, but there was an incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.

Additional information came from the study of Joe 19. It was found that there was a large amount of residual <a href="uranium-233">uranium-233</a>. The Soviet scientists had used this isotope so they could distinguish the behaviour of uranium in different parts of the system. This clarified that it was a two-stage device. Hulme prepared a paper in January 1956. At this point there were still three stages, Dick being a fission device and Harry the thermonuclear component. Two weeks later, <a href="Kenneth%20Allen%20%28physicist%29">Ken Allen</a> produced a paper in which he described the mechanism of thermonuclear burning. He suggested that the Americans had compressed lithium-6 and uranium around a <a href="fissile">fissile</a> core. In April 1956, the recognisable ancestor of the later devices appeared. There were now only two stages: Tom, the fission primary; and Dick, which was now also a set of concentric spheres, with uranium-235 and lithium-6 deuteride shells. A spherical Dick was chosen in preference to a cylindrical one for ease of calculation; work on a cylindrical Dick was postponed until a new <a href="IBM%20704">IBM 704</a> computer arrived from the United States.

Implicit in the creation of a hydrogen bomb was that it would be tested. Eden, who replaced Churchill as prime minister after the latter's retirement, gave a radio broadcast in which he declared: "You cannot prove a bomb until it has exploded. Nobody can know whether it is effective or not until it has been tested."
Testing of boosted designs was carried out <a href="Operation%20Mosaic">Operation Mosaic</a> in the Monte Bello Islands in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> in May and June 1956. This was a sensitive matter; there was an agreement with Australia that no thermonuclear testing would be carried out there. The Australian <a href="Department%20of%20Supply">Minister for Supply</a> <a href="Howard%20Beale%20%28politician%29">Howard Beale</a>, responding to rumours reported in the newspapers, asserted that "the Federal Government has no intention of allowing any, hydrogen bomb tests to take place in Australia. Nor has it any intention of allowing any experiments connected with hydrogen bomb tests to take place here." Since the tests "were" connected with hydrogen bomb development, this prompted Eden to cable the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, detailing the nature and purpose of the tests. He promised that the yield of the second, larger test would not be more than two and a half times that of the Operation Hurricane test, which was . Menzies cabled his approval of the tests on 20 June 1955. The yield of the second test turned out to be , which was larger than the limit of for tests in Australia.

Another test site was therefore required. For safety and security reasons, in light of the "Lucky Dragon" incident, a large site remote from population centres was required. Various remote islands in the South Pacific and Southern Oceans were considered, along with Antarctica. The Admiralty suggested the <a href="Antipodes%20Islands">Antipodes Islands</a>, which are about southeast of New Zealand. In May 1955, the Minister for Defence, <a href="Selwyn%20Lloyd">Selwyn Lloyd</a>, concluded that the <a href="Kermadec%20Islands">Kermadec Islands</a>, which lie about northeast of New Zealand, would be suitable. They were part of New Zealand, so Eden wrote to the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand">Prime Minister of New Zealand</a>, <a href="Sidney%20Holland">Sidney Holland</a>, to ask for permission to use the islands. Holland refused, fearing an adverse public reaction in forthcoming elections. Despite reassurances and pressure from the British government, Holland remained firm. The search for a location continued, with <a href="Malden%20Island">Malden Island</a> and <a href="McKean%20Island">McKean Island</a> being considered. The former became the frontrunner. Three <a href="Avro%20Shackleton">Avro Shackleton</a>s from <a href="No.%20240%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 240 Squadron RAF</a> were sent to conduct an aerial reconnaissance and Holland agreed to send the <a href="survey%20ship">survey ship</a> to conduct a maritime survey.

The test series was given the secret codename "Operation Grapple". <a href="Air%20Commodore">Air Commodore</a> <a href="Wilfrid%20Oulton">Wilfrid Oulton</a> was appointed task force commander, with the acting rank of <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> from 1 March 1956. He had a formidable task ahead of him. Nearby <a href="Kiritimati">Christmas Island</a> was chosen as a base. It was claimed by both Britain and the United States, but the Americans were willing to let the British use it for the tests. With pressure mounting at home and abroad for a moratorium on testing, 1 April 1957 was set as the target date. Oulton held the first meeting of the Grapple Executive Committee on <a href="New%20Oxford%20Street">New Oxford Street</a> in London on 21 February 1956. The RAF and <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> would improve the airfield to enable it to operate large, heavily loaded aircraft, and the port and facilities would be improved to enable Christmas Island to operate as a base by 1 December 1956. It was estimated that of stores would be required for the construction effort alone. The <a href="Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank">tank landing ship</a> HMS "Narvik" would reprise the role of control ship it had for Operation Hurricane; but as it was also required for Operation Mosaic, it had very little time to return to the <a href="Chatham%20Dockyard">Chatham Dockyard</a> for a refit before heading out to Christmas Island for Operation Grapple.

Having decided on a location and date, there still remained the matter of what would be tested. <a href="John%20Challens">John Challens</a>, whose weapons electronics group would have to produce the assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a <a href="Red%20Beard%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Red Beard</a> Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. The designs were frozen in July. Green Bamboo was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with the design continued. On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a <a href="Yellow%20Sun%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Yellow Sun</a> casing that could be used by the <a href="Blue%20Steel%20%28missile%29">Blue Steel</a> guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would have cost another ₤1.5 million.

The first test of the series was Grapple 1, of Short Granite. This bomb was dropped from a height of by a <a href="Vickers%20Valiant">Vickers Valiant</a> <a href="bomber">bomber</a> of <a href="No.%2049%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 49 Squadron RAF</a> piloted by Wing Commander <a href="Kenneth%20Hubbard">Kenneth Hubbard</a>, off the shore of Malden Island at 11:38 local time on 15 May 1957. It was Britain's second airdrop of a nuclear bomb after the <a href="British%20nuclear%20tests%20at%20Maralinga%23Operation%20Buffalo">Operation Buffalo</a> test at <a href="Maralinga">Maralinga</a> on 11 October 1956, and the first of a thermonuclear weapon. The United States had not attempted an airdrop of a hydrogen bomb until the <a href="Operation%20Redwing">Operation Redwing</a> Cherokee test on 21 May 1956. Their bomb had landed from the target; Hubbard missed by just . The Short Granite's yield was estimated at , far below its designed capability. Penney cancelled the Green Granite test and substituted a new weapon codenamed Purple Granite. This was identical to Short Granite, but with some minor modification to its Dick; additional uranium-235 was added, and the outer layer was replaced with aluminium. Despite its failure, the test was described as a successful thermonuclear explosion, and the government did not confirm or deny reports that the UK had become a third thermonuclear power. When documents on the series were declassified in the 1990s, the tests were denounced as a hoax, but the reports were unlikely to have fooled the American observers.
The next test was Grapple 2, of Orange Herald (small). This bomb was dropped at 10:44 local time on 31 May by another 49 Squadron Valiant, piloted by <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> Dave Roberts. It exploded with a force of . The yield was the largest ever achieved by a single stage device, and made it technically a megaton weapon, but it was close to Corner's estimate for an unboosted yield, and Hulme doubted that the lithium-6 deuteride had contributed at all. This was chalked up to <a href="Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor%20instability">Taylor instability</a>, which limited the compression of the light elements in the core. The bomb was hailed as a hydrogen bomb, and the truth that it was actually a large fission bomb was kept secret by the British government until the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

An <a href="Operational%20Requirement">Operational Requirement</a> (OR1142) had been issued in 1955 for a thermonuclear warhead for a <a href="medium-range%20ballistic%20missile">medium-range ballistic missile</a>, which became <a href="Blue%20Streak%20%28missile%29">Blue Streak</a>. This was revised in November 1955, with "megaton" replacing "thermonuclear". Orange Herald (small) could then meet the requirement. A version was created as an interim megaton weapon in order to provide the RAF with one at the earliest possible date. Codenamed <a href="Green%20Grass%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">Green Grass</a>, the unsuccessful fusion boosting was omitted, and it used Green Bamboo's 72-lens implosion system instead of Orange Herald's 32. This allowed the amount of highly enriched uranium to be reduced from to . Its yield was estimated at . It was placed in a Blue Danube casing, and this bomb became known as <a href="Violet%20Club">Violet Club</a>. About ten were delivered before Yellow Sun became available.

The third and final shot of the series was Grapple 3, the test of Purple Granite. This was dropped by a Valiant piloted by Squadron Leader Arthur Steele on 19 June. The yield was a very disappointing , even less than Short Granite. The changes had not worked. "We haven't got it right", Cook told a flabbergasted Oulton. "We shall have to do it all again, providing we can do so before the ban comes into force; so that means as soon as possible."
A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of explaining the failure to the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a>, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material, that they could not be built to produce yields of more than a megaton, and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the <a href="V-bomber">V-bomber</a>s, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a> following Eden's resignation in the wake of the <a href="Suez%20crisis">Suez crisis</a>. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the <a href="British%20nuclear%20tests%20at%20Maralinga%23Operation%20Antler">Operation Antler</a> tests were cancelled, but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.
The scientists at Aldermaston had created a design incorporating staging, radiation implosion, and compression, but they had not mastered the design of thermonuclear weapons. Knowing that much of the yield of American and Soviet bombs came from fission in the uranium-238 tamper, they had focused on what they called the "lithium-uranium cycle", whereby neutrons from the fission of uranium would trigger fusion, which would produce more neutrons to induce fission in the tamper. However, this is not the most important reaction. Corner and his theoretical physicists at Aldermaston argued that Green Granite could be made to work by increasing compression and reducing Taylor instability. The first step would be achieved with an improved Tom. The Red Beard Tom was given an improved high explosive supercharge, a composite (uranium-235 and plutonium) core, and a beryllium tamper, thereby increasing its yield to . The Dick was greatly simplified; instead of the 14 layers in Short Granite, it would have just three. This was called Round A; a five-layer version was also discussed, which was called Round B. A third round, Round C, was produced, for diagnostics. It had the same three layers as Round A, but an inert layer instead of lithium deuteride. Calculations for Round B were performed on the new IBM 704, while the old <a href="Ferranti%20Mark%201">Ferranti Mark 1</a> was used for the simpler Round A.

The next trial was known as Grapple X. To save time and money, and as "Narvik" and the <a href="light%20aircraft%20carrier">light aircraft carrier</a> were unavailable, the bomb would be dropped off the southern tip of Christmas Island rather than off Malden Island, just from the airfield where 3,000 men would be based. This required a major construction effort to improve the facilities on Christmas Island, and those that had been constructed on Malden Island had to now be duplicated on Christmas Island. Works included 26 blast-proof shelters, a control room, and tented accommodation. Components of Rounds A and C were delivered to Christmas Island on 24, 27 and 29 October. Round B would not be available; to get the calculations for Round A completed, the IBM 704 had to be turned over to them, and there was no possibility of completing the Round B calculations on the Ferranti. On inspection, a fault was found in the Round A Tom, and the fissile core was replaced with the one from Round C.

Round A was dropped by a Valiant bomber piloted by Squadron Leader Barney Millett at 08:47 on 8 November 1957. This time the yield of exceeded expectations; the predicted yield had only been . But it was still below the safety limit. This was the real hydrogen bomb Britain wanted, but it used a relatively large quantity of expensive highly enriched uranium. Due to the higher-than-expected yield of the explosion, there was some damage to buildings, the fuel storage tanks, and helicopters on the island.
The physicists at Aldermaston had plenty of ideas about how to follow up Grapple X. Possibilities were discussed in September 1957. One was to tinker with the width of the shells in the Dick to find an optimal configuration. If they were too thick, they would slow the neutrons generated by the fusion reaction; if they were too thin, they would give rise to Taylor instability. Another was to do away with the shells entirely and use a mixture of uranium-235, uranium-238 and deuterium. Ken Allen had an idea, which Sam Curran supported, of a three-layer Dick that used lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium-6 (and therefore had more lithium-7), but more of it, reducing the amount of uranium-235 in the centre of the core. This proposal was the one adopted in October, and it became known as "Dickens" because it used Ken's Dick. The device would otherwise be similar to Round A, but with a larger radiation case. The safety limit was again set to . Keith Roberts calculated that the yield could reach , and suggested that this could be reduced by modifying the tamper, but Cook opposed this, fearing that it might cause the test to fail. Because of the possibility of a moratorium on testing, plans for the test, codenamed Grapple Y, were restricted to the Prime Minister, who gave verbal approval, and a handful of officials.

Air Vice Marshal <a href="John%20Grandy">John Grandy</a> succeeded Oulton as Task Force commander. The bomb was dropped off Christmas at 10:05 local time on 28 April 1958 by a Valiant piloted by Squadron Leader Bob Bates. It had an explosive yield of about , and remains the largest British nuclear weapon ever tested. The design of Grapple Y was notably successful because much of its yield came from its thermonuclear reaction instead of fission of a heavy uranium-238 tamper, making it a true hydrogen bomb, and because its yield had been closely predicted—indicating that its designers understood what they were doing.

On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower announced a moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. The international moratorium commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased atmospheric testing for good.

British timing was good. The Soviet Union's launch of <a href="Sputnik%201">Sputnik 1</a>, the world's first <a href="artificial%20satellite">artificial satellite</a>, on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>, officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend the relationship with Britain that had been damaged by the Suez Crisis. At the suggestion of <a href="Harold%20Caccia%2C%20Baron%20Caccia">Harold Caccia</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Ambassadors%20from%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20the%20United%20States">British Ambassador to the United States</a>, Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources to meet the challenge. To do this, the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed. British <a href="information%20security">information security</a>, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb. The trenchant opposition from the <a href="Joint%20Committee%20on%20Atomic%20Energy">Joint Committee on Atomic Energy</a> that had derailed previous attempts was absent. Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and were signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958. The <a href="1958%20US%E2%80%93UK%20Mutual%20Defence%20Agreement">1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement</a> was signed on 3 July, and was approved by Congress on 30 July. Macmillan called this "the Great Prize".

The <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) invited the British government to send representatives to a series of meetings in Washington, DC, on 27 and 28 August 1958 to work out the details. The U.S. delegation included <a href="Willard%20Libby">Willard Libby</a>, AEC deputy chairman; Major General <a href="Herbert%20Loper">Herbert Loper</a>, the Assistant to the Secretary of Defence for Atomic Energy Affairs; Brigadier General <a href="Alfred%20Starbird">Alfred Starbird</a>, AEC Director of Military Applications; <a href="Norris%20Bradbury">Norris Bradbury</a>, director of the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>; <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>, director of the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore Laboratory</a>; and James W. McCrae, president of the <a href="Sandia%20Corporation">Sandia Corporation</a>. The British representatives were Brundrett and J.H.B. Macklen from the Ministry of Defence, and Penney, Cook and E. F. Newly from Aldermaston. The Americans disclosed the details of nine of their nuclear weapon designs: the <a href="Mark%207%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 7</a>, <a href="Mark%2015%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 15</a>/<a href="Mark%2039%20nuclear%20bomb">39</a>, <a href="W19%20%28nuclear%20artillery%20shell%29">Mark 19</a>, <a href="W25%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">Mark 25</a>, <a href="Mark%2027%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 27</a>, <a href="B28%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 28</a>, <a href="W31">Mark 31</a>, <a href="W33%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">Mark 33</a> and <a href="W34%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">Mark 34</a>. In return, the British provided the details of seven of theirs, including Green Grass; Pennant, the boosted device which had been detonated in the Grapple Z test on 22 August; Flagpole, the two-stage device scheduled for 2 September; Burgee, scheduled for 23 September; and the three-stage Haillard 3. The Americans were impressed with the British designs, particularly with Haillard 1, the heavier version of Haillard 3. Cook therefore changed the Grapple Z programme to fire Haillard 1 instead of Haillard 3. Macmillan wrote to Plowden: 

The Anglo-American Special Relationship proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals; the United States was far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The British decided to adapt the Mark 28 as a British weapon as a cheaper alternative to doing their own development, which became <a href="Red%20Snow">Red Snow</a>. Other weapons were supplied through <a href="Project%20E">Project E</a>, under which weapons in American custody were supplied for the use of the RAF and British Army. Nuclear material was also acquired from the United States. Under the Mutual Defence Agreement 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced plutonium was sent to the US in return for of <a href="tritium">tritium</a> and 7.5 tonnes of highly enriched uranium between 1960 and 1979, replacing Capenhurst production, although much of the highly enriched uranium was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing UK fleet of nuclear submarines. The British ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the <a href="UK%20Polaris%20programme">UK Polaris programme</a> and <a href="Trident%20nuclear%20programme">Trident nuclear programme</a> using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.

Jean Bolikango

Jean Bolikango or Bolikango Akpolokaka Gbukulu Nzete Nzube (4 February 1909 – 17 February 1982) was a Congolese educator, writer, and conservative politician. He served twice as Deputy Prime Minister of the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20%28L%C3%A9opoldville%29">Republic of the Congo</a> (now the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>), in September 1960 and from February to August 1962. Enjoying substantial popularity among the <a href="Bangala%20language">Bangala</a> people, he headed the Parti de l'Unité Nationale and worked as a key opposition member in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Parliament</a> in the early 1960s.

Bolikango began his career in the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a> as a teacher in Catholic schools, and became a prominent member of Congolese society as the leader of a cultural association. He wrote an award-winning novel and worked as a journalist before turning to politics in the late 1950s. Though he held a top communications post in the colonial administration, he became a leader in the push for independence, making him one of the "fathers of independence" in the Congo. The Republic of the Congo became independent in 1960 and Bolikango attempted to organise a national political base that would support his bid for a prestigious office in the new government. He succeeded in establishing the Parti de l'Unité Nationale and promoted both a united Congo and strong ties with Belgium. Older than most of his contemporaries and commanding significant respect—especially among his Bangala peers, he was seen as the Congo's "elder statesman". Regardless, his attempts to secure a position in the government failed and he became a leading member of the opposition in Parliament. 

As the country became embroiled in a <a href="Congo%20Crisis">domestic crisis</a>, the first government was dislodged and succeeded by several different administrations. Bolikango served as Deputy Prime Minister in one of the new governments before a partial state of stability was reestablished in 1961. He mediated between warring factions in the Congo and briefly served once again as Deputy Prime Minister in 1962 before returning to the parliamentary opposition. After <a href="Joseph-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Mobutu">Joseph-Désiré Mobutu</a> took power in 1965, Bolikango became a minister in his government. Mobutu soon dismissed him but appointed him to the political bureau of the <a href="Mouvement%20Populaire%20de%20la%20R%C3%A9volution">Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution</a>. Bolikango left the bureau in 1970. He left Parliament in 1975 and died seven years later. His grandson created the Jean Bolikango Foundation in his memory to promote social progress. The President of the Congo posthumously awarded Bolikango a medal in 2005 for his long career in public service.

Jean Bolikango was born in <a href="L%C3%A9opoldville">Léopoldville</a>, <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a>, on 4 February 1909 to a <a href="Bangala%20language">Bangala</a> family from <a href="%C3%89quateur%20%28former%20province%29">Équateur Province</a>. In 1917 he enrolled in St. Joseph's Institute, graduating in December 1925 after six years of <a href="primary%20school">primary school</a>, two years of pedagogical studies, and one year of stenography and typing courses. He became a licensed primary school teacher the following year. Bolikango taught at <a href="CICM%20Missionaries">Scheutist</a> schools and finally St. Joseph's Institute until 1958. He instructed a total of 1,300 students, including future Prime Minister <a href="Joseph%20Il%C3%A9o">Joseph Iléo</a>, future Prime Minister <a href="Cyrille%20Adoula">Cyrille Adoula</a>, future Minister of Finance <a href="Arthur%20Pinzi">Arthur Pinzi</a>, future Minister of Social Affairs <a href="Jacques%20Massa">Jacques Massa</a>, future dramatist <a href="Albert%20Mongita">Albert Mongita</a>, and future <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Catholic Cardinal</a> <a href="Joseph%20Malula">Joseph Malula</a>. In 1946 he became the president of the Association des Anciens élèves des pères de Scheut (ADAPÉS), a position he held until his death.

That year Bolikango, as the leader of the capital "<a href="%C3%A9volu%C3%A9s">évolués</a>", worked closely with missionary <a href="Rapha%C3%ABl%20de%20la%20Kethulle%20de%20Ryhove">Raphaël de la Kethulle de Ryhove</a> to establish the Union des Interets Sociaux Congolais (UNISCO), a cultural society for leaders of elite Congolese associations. He then became its vice president. The organisation was viewed favorably by the colonial administration for its attachment to Belgian social ideals, though it would later become a forum for revolutionary politics. In 1954 Bolikango founded and, for a time, served as general chairman of the Liboka Lya Bangala, the first Bangala ethnic association, based in Léopoldville. By 1957 it encompassed 48 affiliated tribal organisations and had 50,000 members. He authored a novel in <a href="Lingala">Lingala</a> entitled "Mondjeni-Mobé: Le Hardi", which won a consolation prize for creative writing from the Conference on African Studies at the International Fair in <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> in 1948. He also made a submission to the 1949 contest, but no prize was awarded. Bolikango soon befriended <a href="Joseph%20Kasa-Vubu">Joseph Kasa-Vubu</a> and sponsored his election as secretary-general of ADAPÉS in order to bring him into UNISCO, thereby furthering the latter's political standing. Bolikango eventually married a woman named Claire. He also obtained a "carte de mérite civique" from the Belgian administration and served on the commission responsible for its assignment to deserving Congolese.

Bolikango first went abroad when he attended Kethulle de Ryhove's funeral in Belgium in 1956. During his return trip he stopped in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to meet African members of the <a href="French%20Parliament">French Parliament</a>. That year he met a handful of his former students and other Congolese leaders in his home. Together they drafted the first Congolese political <a href="manifesto">manifesto</a>, "<a href="Manifeste%20de%20Conscience%20Africaine">Manifeste de Conscience Africaine</a>". In 1958 he resigned from his teaching post and went to <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> to represent Catholic education at the <a href="Expo%2058">Expo 58</a> event, holding responsibility for public relations at the Missions Pavilion. This led him to study press, radio, television, film, and mass education techniques at the Office of Information and Public Relations for the Belgian Congo and <a href="Ruanda-Urundi">Ruanda-Urundi</a>. In August 1959 he was appointed Assistant Commissioner of Information in the office, making him one of only two Congolese to ever hold a second grade civil servant position in the Belgian colonial administration. In that capacity he initiated a comparative study of information services across <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, compiled details on Congolese politicians, gave numerous speeches, and helped design <a href="Bantu%20language">Bantu language</a> courses at the <a href="University%20of%20Ghent">University of Ghent</a>. He regularly wrote for the Léopoldville monthly "La Voix du Congolais" and the Catholic newspaper "La Croix du Congo". In 1960 Bolikango started his own newspaper, "La Nation Congalaise". In his contributions he frequently advocated for equal pay between black and whites <a href="Equal%20pay%20for%20equal%20work">for the same labor</a>.

Bolikango was older than most of his political contemporaries and was regarded as the Congo's "elder statesman". He was labeled conservative and "pro-Belgian". He considered the <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>ese poet and politician <a href="L%C3%A9opold%20S%C3%A9dar%20Senghor">Léopold Sédar Senghor</a> to be a principal influence on his beliefs. He also admired <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny">Félix Houphouët-Boigny</a> of <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Côte d'Ivoire</a> for his "wisdom and calmness". Like other members of the original Congolese establishment, Bolikango sought a gradual decolonisation process during which the Belgian authorities were to be amicably negotiated with. He believed the Congo should be united in a broad fashion and supported the formation of a <a href="Pan-Africanism">union of African states</a>.

In 1953 Bolikango became a substitute member of the Conseil de la province de Léopoldville. He served in the post for three years. In December 1957 he unsuccessfully entered Léopoldville's first municipal elections. The Bangala as a whole did not do well in the campaign; their only form of organisation was Bolikango's Liboka Lya Bangala, an association with little cohesion. Following the electoral defeats, Bolikango decided to organise the Interfédérale, a federation among various regional and ethnic groups of the northern Congo that became the basis of his new Parti de l'unité Congolaise. Almost immediately after its creation the party collapsed due to ethnic differences. In April 1959 <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a> asked Bolikango to become director of his nationalist political party, the <a href="Mouvement%20National%20Congolais">Mouvement National Congolais</a> (MNC), but he never committed to a decision. In the autumn of 1959 the Interfédérale became a part of the <a href="Parti%20National%20du%20Progr%C3%A8s">Parti National du Progrès</a> (PNP). Bolikango did not follow them, instead founding the Front de l'unite Bangala (FUB), a political party representing the Bangala people of the northeastern Congo. Among them he was a popular figure; Bangala nicknames for him included "the <a href="Sage%20%28philosophy%29">Sage</a>" and even "<a href="Moses">Moses</a>". He hoped that by promoting the idea of a "grande ethnie bangala" he could enhance his political prospects. The Bangala were only unified as a political faction in the capital, so he began to look elsewhere for support. He was also a cofounder of the short-lived Mouvement pour le Progres National Congolais, a party formed by attendees of the Brussels exposition.

Bolikango soon thereafter created the Association des ressortisants du Haut-Congo (ASSORECO). From 20 January to 20 February 1960 Bolikango attended the <a href="Belgo-Congolese%20Round%20Table%20Conference">Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference</a> in Brussels to discuss the Congo's future under Belgian rule, serving as the leading delegate for ASSORECO. He was made a member of the conference's bureau. During the discussions he made an unexpectedly sharp denunciation of Belgian propaganda. He also acted as the spokesperson for the Front Common, the political umbrella for all the Congolese delegations. In that capacity on 27 January he publicly revealed that independence would be granted to the Congolese on 30 June. Following the conference he traveled with a colleague to <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a>, <a href="Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a> to meet local politicians.

To consolidate his political power in Équateur Province, Bolikango summoned a congress to <a href="Lisala">Lisala</a> that lasted from 24 March to 3 April. Like his own party, the other political groups of Équateur lacked the necessary support to make significant gains in the upcoming independent elections. Bolikango was eager to win a prominent government office and aimed to form a broad coalition with the <a href="Ngombe%20language%20%28Congo%29">Ngombe</a>, <a href="Mongo%20people">Mongo</a>, and <a href="Ngwaka">Ngwaka</a> peoples and other minorities in the province to achieve it. This could be best accomplished, in his view, through an alliance of his own groups, the FUB and ASSORECO, with UNIMO, FEDUNEC, UNILAC, and local chiefs who had not already put their support behind the PNP.

In his opening address at the congress, Bolikango said that while "parties based on ethnic foundations" made the first step toward a unified Congo, the "national interest" of the country rested upon a "unity of will". He enumerated that this "does not mean that each ethnic group must abandon its own characteristics, but that through these differences one must endeavour to form a harmonious ensemble." The UNIMO leadership was skeptical of Bolikango's unified outlook for the Congo and remained independent, although he secured the support of the Ngombe, some of the Ngwaka and Bangala, and chiefs from the Lisala, <a href="Bongandanga">Bongandanga</a>, and Bumba regions. The FUB made an alliance with ASSORECO and FEDUNEC, transforming into the <a href="Party%20of%20National%20Unity%20%28Congo-Kinshasa%29">Parti de l'Unité Nationale</a> (PUNA). In spite of its attempts to garner more national appeal, the new party retained its regional bias and failed to amass substantial outside support, costing Bolikango much of his backing in Léopoldville. Still, this reformed political base allowed him to win a position as a national deputy from the <a href="Mongala">Mongala</a> district in the <a href="Belgian%20Congo%20general%20election%2C%201960">May 1960 national election</a> by 15,000 votes. He used his position as the president of PUNA to mediate a dispute between the party and minority alliances in Équateur and create a coalition provincial government. After the elections PUNA gradually pulled apart into two different wings, one led by Bolikango and the other by Équateur Provincial President <a href="Laurent%20Eketebi">Laurent Eketebi</a>.

Meanwhile, the MNC sharply criticised Bolikango's connections with the Belgians, undermining his reputation in both Équateur and the capital. The <a href="Alliance%20des%20Bakongo">Alliance des Bakongo</a> (ABAKO) also despised him due to his support for Catholic missions and the perception that he was "pro-white". He spent the month of May touring the Congo, claiming that he had the support of other party leaders in an alliance against Lumumba and the MNC. This opposition alliance was soon announced as the Cartel d'Union Nationale. As Lumumba was assembling his proposed cabinet, the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%29">Chamber of Deputies</a> convened on 21 June to elect its officers. Bolikango made a bid to be President of the Chamber, but lost the vote to the MNC candidate, <a href="Joseph%20Kasongo">Joseph Kasongo</a>, 74 to 58. The subsequent election of the <a href="Senate%20%28Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%29">Senate</a>'s officers also indicated an MNC advantage. Realising that Lumumba's bloc controlled Parliament, several members of the Cartel became eager to negotiate for a coalition government so they could share power, especially Bolikango, who hoped to secure the position of Defence Minister. This did not occur, but he did exact a written pledge from Lumumba of support for his bid to become the first <a href="President%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">President of the Republic of the Congo</a> in exchange for his party's backing of <a href="Lumumba%20Government">Lumumba's government</a>.

Bolikango faced his former protégé, Joseph Kasa-Vubu of ABAKO, in the parliamentary vote for the presidency. Lumumba realised that the Belgians would only accept him as Prime Minister if Kasa-Vubu held office, so he switched allegiances, privately dismissing Bolikango as a "pawn of Belgium and a protégé of the Catholics", and secretly endorsing Kasa-Vubu. Bolikango lost the parliamentary vote 159 to 43 and was left infuriated. In addition to Lumumba's duplicity, Bolikango also suffered in the election due to his recent association with the colonial administration and his breaking with the Cartel to negotiate with Lumumba. According to his friend, <a href="Thomas%20Kanza">Thomas Kanza</a>, the loss was "the most bitter failure in his entire career." He then helped organise an anti-MNC coalition in Parliament.

During the <a href="Congo%20Crisis">Congo Crisis</a> that followed Congolese independence, Bolikango acted as a <a href="United%20States%20Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">United States Central Intelligence Agency</a> informant. Early in the crisis he accused Prime Minister Lumumba of ignoring opposition groups and deliberately stifling dissent; on 3 August he officially denounced Lumumba's policies. Five days later he announced that he would support the formation of a separate republic in Équateur Province. In return, Lumumba accused him of plotting the secession of the region. On 1 September Bolikango was arrested in <a href="Gemena">Gemena</a> on Lumumba's orders, ostensibly for committing secessionist activities and planning assassinations of both Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu, and brought to the capital. This led to demonstrations by his supporters throughout the city on the following day. Soon thereafter, President Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba from office and replaced him with Joseph Iléo. Sympathetic soldiers released Bolikango on 6 September. During Iléo's brief first term from 13 September to 20 September Bolikango served as Minister of Information and Minister of Defence. In December he attended a Francophone-African conference in <a href="Brazzaville">Brazzaville</a> as part of a Congolese government delegation.

During Iléo's second term from 9 February until 1 August 1961 Bolikango held the post of Deputy Prime Minister. By then he felt threatened by the sudden collapse of political unity in the Congo and supported the government's efforts at re-centralisation. He participated in the Tananarive and <a href="Mbandaka">Coquilhatville</a> conferences of March and April 1961, representing Équateur and <a href="Ubangi%20Province">Ubangi</a>, respectively, to seek a compromise on constitutional issues. Throughout June he worked alongside Cyrille Adoula and <a href="Marcel%20Lihau">Marcel Lihau</a> to negotiate a settlement between the central government and a rival <a href="Free%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Free Republic of the Congo</a> in the eastern portion of the country. This culminated in a conference in July that resulted in the election of Adoula as Prime Minister. Bolikango was certain that he would also be elected as President but Kasa-Vubu retained the office.

After the conference Bolikango helped to mediate negotiations between Adoula and secessionist figure <a href="Mo%C3%AFse%20Tshombe">Moïse Tshombe</a>, leader of the breakaway <a href="State%20of%20Katanga">State of Katanga</a>. Bolikango claimed that he alone could resolve the situation by sitting "Bantu fashion with legs out stretched" around a table with Tshombe. He scheduled a political conference to take place in Stanleyville to create a new political party with <a href="Antoine%20Gizenga">Antoine Gizenga</a> with the intent of isolating Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO in Parliament so he could remove the former from the presidency and replace him. The plans dissolved after Gizenga was arrested in January 1962. On 13 February Bolikango was appointed Deputy Prime Minister. On 12 July Adoula downsized his government and dismissed him from his post. He then re-entered the parliamentary opposition and, by August, was working with <a href="R%C3%A9my%20Mwamba">Rémy Mwamba</a> and <a href="Christophe%20Gbenye">Christophe Gbenye</a> (both ex-ministers also dismissed from Adoula's government) to try and secure support to dislodge Adoula. Bolikango was the opposition's favorite to replace the Prime Minister. In 1963 following the defeat of Katanga, he managed to organise an opposition coalition to Adoula's government, consisting of ABAKO, leftist followers of Lumumba (by then killed) and Gizenga, and Tshombe's <a href="CONAKAT">Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga</a> (CONAKAT). He also foiled an attempt by one of Adoula's ministers to establish a pro-government party in Équateur. That year Parliament was adjourned and Bolikango's term as a national deputy ended. In late 1963 Laurent Eketebi left PUNA and allied himself with the Budja tribal minority in the provincial assembly, destroying the concept of a unified Bangala tribe that Bolikango had used to elevate his social and political standing.

In 1962 Parliament assented to the partitioning of the Congo's six provinces into smaller political units. The subdivision damaged PUNA's political clout, as it had a strong following in Coquilhatville, the Équateur capital, but not in the outlying areas, where it relied on control of the provincial administration to ensure its presence. Bolikango had opposed the splitting of Équateur, and in 1965 he made provincial reunification a key part of his parliamentary campaign platform. In the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20general%20election%2C%201965">1965 elections</a> he was reelected to a second term in the Chamber of Deputies on a PUNA–<a href="Convention%20Nationale%20Congolaise">Convention Nationale Congolaise</a> (CONACO) ticket. He received 53,083 preferential votes, making him the most popular Congolese representative of his respective constituency, second only to Tshombe in southern Katanga. Nevertheless, his provincial reunification proposal met strong resistance from the deputies of <a href="Ubangi%20Province">Ubangi Province</a>—one of the successor divisions to Équateur—and was not carried out.

<a href="Joseph-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Mobutu">Joseph-Désiré Mobutu</a> seized power in November 1965, and on 24 November Bolikango was appointed Minister of Public Works. Mobutu also intervened in a territorial dispute in the former Équateur Province and awarded contested land to Ubangi over Moyen-Congo—the new province Bolikango represented. Upset over the outcome, Bolikango convened a meeting of parliamentarians from both provinces in February 1966 to discuss the restoration of Équateur. His ideas attracted more support than during his previous attempt, as there were provincial assemblymen in Ubangi already petitioning their government for reunification and numerous CONACO politicians had initiated a campaign to eliminate Cuvette-Centrale Province after losing a local struggle for power. With Mobutu's support, Équateur was restored on 11 April.

On 4 April Mobutu dismissed Bolikango from his ministerial post, ostensibly for "lack of discipline and refusing to follow received orders." This firing was the first of many Mobutu would use to pressure established Congolese politicians, though Bolikango was not left disadvantaged for long; on 4 July 1968 he was appointed to the political bureau of the <a href="Mouvement%20Populaire%20de%20la%20R%C3%A9volution">Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution</a> (MPR), the state party, serving there until 16 December 1970. Bolikango's second term as a national deputy ended in 1967. From 1970 until 1975 he served a final term in Parliament, representing the Kinshasa district. 

In his later life Bolikango served as managing director of the Sogenco construction company and general delegate to the Société zaïroise de Matériaux and STK parastatals. During the same time he made frequent trips to Lisala, where he remained a popular figure. Rumors surfaced in the capital that Bolikango was planning to use his regional political esteem for subversive purposes, so the Mobutu regime closely monitored his activities. Bolikango joined the MPR's central committee in September 1980. He died from an illness on 17 February 1982 in <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a>, Belgium.

Sociologist <a href="Ludo%20De%20Witte">Ludo De Witte</a> wrote of Bolikango as a "neo-colonial" politician who was "short-sighted and power-crazy". Bolikango is remembered in the Congo as one of the "fathers of independence". The Fondation Jean Bolikango was created by Bolikango's grandson in his memory. The foundation focuses on supporting education and social progress. In 2005 President <a href="Joseph%20Kabila">Joseph Kabila</a> posthumously awarded Bolikango a medal for dedication to civil service. Bolikango was also a Commander of the <a href="National%20Order%20of%20the%20Leopard">National Order of the Leopard</a>, member of the <a href="Royal%20Order%20of%20the%20Lion">Royal Order of the Lion</a>, and a recipient of the <a href="Benemerenti%20medal">Benemerenti medal</a> (1950), Medaille Commémorative du Voyage royal (1955), gold medal of the Association Royale Sportive Congolaise, and bronze and silver medals for other acts of public service. On 22 February 2007 a ceremony was held in Équateur to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his death.

Operation Grandslam

Operation Grandslam was an offensive undertaken by <a href="United%20Nations%20peacekeeping">United Nations peacekeeping</a> forces from 28 December 1962 to 15 January 1963 against the <a href="Katanga%20Gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a> of the <a href="State%20of%20Katanga">State of Katanga</a>, a secessionist state rebelling against the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20%28L%C3%A9opoldville%29">Republic of the Congo</a> in central Africa. The Katangese forces were decisively defeated and Katanga was forcibly reintegrated into the Congo.

The United Nations had tried several times to reconcile the government of the Congo with the State of Katanga, which had declared independence under <a href="Mo%C3%AFse%20Tshombe">Moïse Tshombe</a> with Belgian support in 1960. Though initially limiting its actions, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Operation%20in%20the%20Congo">United Nations Operation in the Congo</a> became increasingly impatient towards Katanga and Tshombe and drew up plans to resolve the situation through force. Tshombe continuously violated agreements he had made with the United Nations and the Congolese government by building up his forces and bringing foreign mercenaries into the conflict. The situation came to a breaking point in December 1962 when Katangese gendarmes attacked peacekeeping forces in Katanga. <a href="United%20Nations%20Secretary-General">United Nations Secretary-General</a> <a href="U%20Thant">U Thant</a> authorised a retaliatory offensive to eliminate secessionist opposition.

Reinforced by aircraft from Sweden, United Nations peacekeepers completed the first phase of the operation, securing the Katangese capital, <a href="Lubumbashi">Élisabethville</a>, and destroying much of the Katangese Air Force by the end of the year. In early January the United Nations forces turned their attention towards remaining strongholds in southern Katanga. Indian peacekeepers surpassed their orders and crossed the <a href="Lufira%20River">Lufira River</a> ahead of schedule, generating panic behind the Katangese lines and embarrassing the United Nations leadership. Tshombe, realising that his position was untenable, sued Thant for peace. On 17 January 1963, he signed an instrument of surrender and declared the Katangese secession to be over. The central government reorganised the provincial administration of Katanga to weaken its political structure. Tshombe initially participated but feared his arrest and fled to Europe.

Many Katangese gendarmes and their mercenary leaders took refuge in Angola to reorganise, acting under orders from Tshombe. In 1964, Tshombe was welcomed back to the Congo and made prime minister. He immediately called on his forces to suppress communist revolts in the east and centre of the country. This they accomplished but Tshombe was dismissed from his post in 1965, ultimately losing all contact with them following his imprisonment in Algeria in 1967. Relations between the new central government and the gendarmes soured and, after a mutiny was repressed, they returned to Angola. An insurgency for Katangese secession continued until late 2016.

Following the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20%28L%C3%A9opoldville%29">Republic of the Congo</a>'s independence from <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter <a href="South%20Kasai">South Kasai</a> and the <a href="State%20of%20Katanga">State of Katanga</a> declared independence from the Congolese government. The latter contained the vast majority of the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule. Many Katangese thought that they were entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> politics with support from the Belgian government and private interests such as the "<a href="Union%20Mini%C3%A8re%20du%20Haut%20Katanga">Union Minière du Haut Katanga</a>" (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.

The deposition (and eventual murder) of Prime Minister <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a> caused further issues in the country, leading to the declaration of a <a href="Free%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">rival government</a> in <a href="Kisangani">Stanleyville</a> by the end of the year. To prevent a complete collapse of order within the country, the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> established a major <a href="United%20Nations%20Peacekeeping">peacekeeping mission</a>, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Operation%20in%20the%20Congo">United Nations Operation in the Congo</a> (known under its French acronym as ONUC). In addition to a large body of troops (20,000 at its peak strength), a civilian mission was brought in to provide technical assistance to the Congolese government. Initially, ONUC limited its actions to ensuring the safety of Congolese citizens and foreign nationals and refrained from acting against the secessionist states, but the UN ran into trouble in Katanga. The state's leader and head of the locally entrenched "<a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20des%20associations%20tribales%20du%20Katanga">Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga</a>" (CONAKAT), <a href="Mo%C3%AFse%20Tshombe">Moïse Tshombe</a>, at first banned the UN from entering his territory and then greatly limited their peacekeeping efforts. Further issues derived from peacekeepers' attempts to deport foreign mercenaries, many of whom were employed by Katanga.

On 21 February 1961 the <a href="UN%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a> passed <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20161">a resolution</a> permitting ONUC to use military force to prevent civil war, make arrests, halt military operations, arrange ceasefires, and deport foreign military personnel. Under the authorisation of this resolution, UN forces launched <a href="Operation%20Rumpunch">Operation Rumpunch</a> and <a href="Operation%20Morthor">Operation Morthor</a> (sometimes referred to as "Round One" of UN-Katangese conflict) with the aim of securing their own positions in Katanga and eliminating the presence of mercenaries. The former, though limited in scope, was largely successful, but the latter failed to achieve its objectives. As Morthor was underway, <a href="Special%20Representative%20of%20the%20Secretary-General">Special Representative</a> <a href="Conor%20Cruise%20O%27Brien">Conor Cruise O'Brien</a> announced, "The secession of Katanga has ended." This statement was quickly realised to be premature; Katanga fought the offensive to a stalemate.

<a href="United%20Nations%20Secretary-General">United Nations Secretary-General</a> <a href="Dag%20Hammarskj%C3%B6ld">Dag Hammarskjöld</a> attempted to meet Tshombe for negotiations in <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a>, but on the night of 17 September <a href="1961%20Ndola%20United%20Nations%20DC-6%20crash">his plane crashed</a>, killing all aboard. Hammarskjöld's untimely death, combined with an overall rise in tensions, helped rally international support for a more robust peacekeeping approach. His replacement, <a href="U%20Thant">U Thant</a>, was less averse to using military force in the Congo and believed that the UN should intervene in internal Congolese affairs. Thant promptly requested that the Security Council grant ONUC a stronger mandate. This came in the form of <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20169">a resolution</a> on 24 November, which maintained the goals of previous ONUC resolutions and cleared up any remaining ambiguities surrounding the role and nature of the UN's intervention. It reaffirmed ONUC's ability to detain and deport foreign military personnel and mercenaries with force, described Katanga's secessionist activities as illegal, and declared the UN's support for the central government of the Congo in its efforts to "maintain law and order and national integrity".

Tshombe immediately responded to the resolution by broadcasting an inflammatory speech against ONUC. This was followed by the assault of two UN officials and the murder of two Indian soldiers at the hands of the <a href="Katangese%20Gendarmerie">Katangese Gendarmerie</a>. In turn ONUC's command structure in Katanga, mindful of the new mandate, issued instructions to UN troops to put "an end to Katangese resistance to UN policy by destruction of Gendarmerie and other anti-UN resistance."

In December 1961, the UN initiated <a href="Operation%20Unokat">Operation Unokat</a> (dubbed "Round Two") to ensure ONUC personnel's freedom of movement and reassert their authority in Katanga. Under military pressure, Tshombe was forced to enter serious negotiations with Congolese Prime Minister <a href="Cyrille%20Adoula">Cyrille Adoula</a>. On 21 December 1961 Tshombe signed the Kitona Declaration, an agreement whereby he would recognise the authority of the central government and work to reintegrate Katanga into the Republic. However, Tshombe subsequently deferred to the Katangese Parliament and put off any action of reconciliation. In January 1962 the Stanleyville government was finally subdued and the UN was able to refocus its efforts on ending the Katangese secession. By then, contact between the central government and Katanga had broken down and ONUC intelligence reports indicated that the latter was rebuilding its forces.
In August Thant proposed a "Plan for National Reconciliation" by which Katanga would rejoin a <a href="Federalism">federalised</a> Congo. Adoula and Tshombe both accepted the proposal. Thant was wary of Tshombe's delaying tactics and applied increasing political pressure on the Katangese government to abide by the plan's timetable. Belgian support for Katanga waned as the secession dragged on and the possibility of conflict increased, jeopardising investors' mining interests.

The outbreak of the <a href="Sino-Indian%20War">Sino-Indian War</a> in October raised the potential of all Indian troops being withdrawn from ONUC, putting pressure on UN officials to quickly resolve the secession. The <a href="United%20States">United States</a> government, which had underwritten most of the costs of ONUC, also began pushing for a conclusion, having determined that the operation was financially unsustainable. Still doubting the likelihood of a peaceful resolution, Thant sent Special Representative <a href="Ralph%20Bunche">Ralph Bunche</a> to <a href="L%C3%A9opoldville">Léopoldville</a>, the capital of the Congo. There, Bunch worked with local UN Mission Chief <a href="Robert%20K.%20A.%20Gardiner">Robert K. A. Gardiner</a> and UN Force Commander <a href="Sean%20MacEoin%20%28general%29">Sean MacEoin</a> to create a plan to achieve freedom of movement for ONUC personnel and eliminate the foreign mercenaries.

By then it was obvious that Tshombe did not intend on rejoining the Congo; there were 300 to 500 mercenaries in Katanga (as many as there had been before previous UN operations) and new airfields and defensive positions were being constructed. ONUC personnel and even diplomatic staff faced increasing harassment from Katangese gendarmes. Katangese jets were also attacking ONUC and central government forces, in effect waging civil war. Tshombe was fully aware of the military contingency operation and accused the UN of searching for a pretext to use force against Katanga.

On 27 November the United States and Belgium issued a joint statement, announcing that Thant's plan had failed and calling for increased economic pressure on Katanga. On 11 December Belgian Foreign Minister <a href="Paul-Henri%20Spaak">Paul-Henri Spaak</a> declared that the Belgian government would support the UN or the Congolese government should either one end the Katangese secession through force. He then denounced Tshombe as a "rebel". The United States <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> shortly thereafter dispatched a team to the Congo to evaluate the UN's material requirements for carrying out an offensive and offered military intelligence aid to ONUC. The Katangese responded by organising anti-American demonstrations in Élisabethville.

On 24 December 1962, Katangese forces attacked Ethiopian peacekeepers from several roadblocks and fired upon a UN observation helicopter, forcing it to land. An Indian member of the crew was mortally wounded while the rest were captured and beaten. Although UN troops limited their responses to self-defence, the attacks continued. On 27 December, in reaction to increasing Katangese hostility, the ONUC Air Division issued Fighter Operations Order 16, directing UN aircraft to retaliate against Katangese aircraft mounting any attack (including against non-UN targets) and to shoot down any others deemed to be carrying "visible offensive weapons, such as bombs or rockets".

In an effort to reach a ceasefire, peacekeepers escorted Tshombe to the front lines where he was forced to agree that his own forces were attacking UN positions without provocation. He ordered his troops to cease firing but was ignored. Radio intercepts revealed to the UN that General Norbert Moke, the commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, had ordered the <a href="Katangese%20Air%20Force">Katangese Air Force</a> to bomb the Élisabethville airport on the night of 29 December. With the failure to enact a ceasefire, Major General <a href="Dewan%20Prem%20Chand">Dewan Prem Chand</a> of India convinced Thant to authorise a strong, decisive offensive to pre-emptively eliminate Katangese forces. This brought relief to some of the UN peacekeepers, mindful that they now had justification to act forcefully against Katanga. Determined to avoid civilian casualties and widespread destruction, the secretary-general sent a wire to the UN Force Commander in the Congo to explain that <a href="napalm">napalm</a> was to be prohibited from use in combat. Early on 28 December for unknown reasons, Tshombe quietly departed Élisabethville.

In addition to the 300 to 500 mercenaries, Katanga had approximately 14,000 to 17,000 gendarmes in its service, of whom around 7,000 had not received military training. Through reconnaissance, the UN had learned that these forces were concentrated on defending the southern tier of the province (much of the north was already under central government control), with about 5,150 troops in and around the towns of <a href="Jadotville">Jadotville</a>, <a href="Kolwezi">Kolwezi</a>, and <a href="Bunkeya">Bunkeya</a>. Another 2,000 garrisoned Élisabethville. The UN also estimated that the <a href="Katangese%20Air%20Force">Katangese Air Force</a> possessed a number of <a href="North%20American%20T-6%20Texan">Harvards</a>, <a href="Fouga%20CM.170%20Magister">Magisters</a>, and <a href="de%20Havilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a>s, amounting to a dozen combat aircraft, as well as some other transport aircraft and small planes. However, they believed that many Katangese aircraft were unserviceable. ONUC intelligence observed limited stockpiles of ammunition, petroleum, oil, and lubricants at a few airfields.

ONUC forces in Katanga were under the command of Major General Chand and his operational deputy, Brigadier Reginald Noronha. ONUC force strength had been raised to 18,200, 70 percent of whom were deployed in and around Katanga. Peacekeeping contingents from <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> were earmarked by the UN to carry out Operation Grandslam. In order to simultaneously deploy these troops for the operation, the UN required a large <a href="airlift">airlift</a> capability. ONUC had amassed an air transport fleet of 65 planes, the largest being <a href="Douglas%20DC-4">Douglas DC-4</a>s, but it was still insufficient for Operation Grandslam. Thant's military attaché, <a href="Indar%20Jit%20Rikhye">Indar Jit Rikhye</a>, had requested assistance from the United States Department of Defense. Several days later, the United States committed its <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">air force</a> to provide logistical support. In November <a href="United%20States%20President">United States President</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> offered to supply the UN with American fighter jets to exert an "overwhelming show of strength from the air". Thant, though desiring forceful UN ground and air action, was eager to keep ONUC impartial and wanted to refrain from calling on too much support from any major world powers. On 16 December he declared that he would consider the American offer if the situation remained deadlocked by the spring of 1963.

The need for combat aircraft had been a problem for ONUC. The UN had been delaying the commencement of the operation until sufficient air strength had been amassed to conduct a single attack that could destroy the Katangese Air Force. They feared that a limited attack would fail to eliminate all Katangese aircraft and stretch their own forces thin, thereby allowing Katanga to disperse its air forces among hidden airfields and launch retaliatory attacks on <a href="Kamina%20Air%20Base">Kamina Air Base</a>. India had withdrawn its <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">Canberra bombers</a> in October to guard against China, and Ethiopia repatriated its force of <a href="North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre">Sabres</a> after one was lost in an accident. However, new air surveillance radar equipment was deployed in Kamina and <a href="%C3%89lisabethville">Élisabethville</a>. The ONUC Air Division was bolstered in November by the delivery of two <a href="Saab%2029%20Tunnan">Saab 29 Tunnan</a> (J-29) reconnaissance-variant jets from Sweden, greatly enhancing the force's intelligence capabilities. This was followed shortly thereafter by the arrival of several Swedish J-29 combat aircraft and a 380-strong <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> unit from <a href="Norway">Norway</a>. In all, the UN would field 10 combat J-29s in the operation.

Operation Grandslam was planned to include three phases, but was successfully completed in two. The first phase was designed to "restore the security of ONUC troops in the Élisabethville area and their freedom of movement by clearing the gendarmerie road-blocks from which fire had been directed at United Nations troops." The second phase would involve advances into Jadotville and Kolwezi to arrest foreign mercenaries. The third phase was designed to deal with the mercenaries in <a href="Kamina">Kamina</a>.

Operation Grandslam commenced in the mid-afternoon on 28 December 1962 after Thant's ultimatum that the gendarmerie back down by 15:00 went unanswered, kicking off "Round Three" of the fighting in Katanga. The initial attacks triggered the flight of 50,000 refugees, many towards the Rhodesian border, though most would quickly return. In the first day, UN forces killed 50 Katangese gendarmes before securing downtown Élisabethville, the local Gendarmerie headquarters, the radio station, and Tshombe's presidential palace. The UN demanded that Katanga stop resisting, which Tshombe refused.
Early on 29 December, the ONUC Air Division launched a surprise assault on the Kolwezi airfield. The J-29 fighter jets strafed with their 20mm cannons, as their 13.5mm rockets were inoperable in the overcast skies. Five <a href="fuel%20depot">fuel dumps</a> and the local administrative building were destroyed. Katangese Air Force Commander Jeremiah Puren had, however, managed to evacuate six <a href="North%20American%20T-6%20Texan">Harvard</a> <a href="Trainer%20%28aircraft%29">trainers</a> before the attack occurred. Mercenary <a href="Jan%20Zumbach">Jan Zumbach</a> remained with the other portion of the air force in <a href="Portuguese%20Angola">Portuguese Angola</a> and did not intervene, infuriating Puren, who was ordered by General Moke to fall back to Jadotville. For the rest of the campaign most of the Katangese Air Force remained grounded, as Puren feared his Harvards would perform poorly against the UN's faster J-29 jets. Anti-aircraft fire damaged three UN planes at Kolwezi, but their attacks nonetheless continued throughout the day and were extended to other Katangese airfields, such as those at <a href="Kamatanda%20Airport">Kamatanda</a> and Ngule. Three further UN reconnaissance missions resulted in the destruction of six Katangese aircraft on the ground and one further kill, possibly in the air. According to the UN, the air raids against the Kantangese Air Force were completed "without loss of life" on either side. Destroying so much of the Katangese Air Force at the onset of the operation was key for the UN to succeed; if Katanga were able to launch coordinated air attacks against UN supply airlifts, Grandslam would likely fail.

At midday Ethiopian units advanced down the Kipushi road to sever the Katangese lines to Rhodesia. Gendarmes were well positioned in wooded heights overlooking the route, but following heavy mortar bombardment they surrendered with little opposition. Irish troops, detailed for the purpose because they spoke English and could communicate with Rhodesian border guards, then passed through at night and seized the town of <a href="Kipushi">Kipushi</a> without facing any resistance. Gardiner, holding a press conference on the matter in Léopoldville, jubilantly declared, "[W]e are not going to make the mistake of stopping short this time. This is going to be as decisive as we can make it." By 30 December, all the objectives for the first phase of Operation Grandslam had been accomplished. Major General Chand received a congratulatory telegram from Thant for the progress of UN forces.

Pleased with the success of operations in Élisabethville, Chand decided to immediately carry forward with the UN's plans. In the afternoon of 30 December the head of the Swedish battalion at Kamina Air Base, "<a href="%C3%96verstel%C3%B6jtnant">Överstelöjtnant</a>" <a href="Bengt%20Fredman">Bengt Fredman</a>, received orders to advance upon the gendarmerie encampments in Kamina early the following morning. The gendarmes had expected an attack on 30 December, but when one failed to occur they began to drink beer and fire flares at random, possibly to boost morale. Rogue bands of gendarmes subsequently conducted random raids around the city and looted the local bank.

Swedish and Ghanaian troops were ordered out of Kamina Air Base the following morning at 05:20. By 06:00 they were advancing down the main road towards the town of Kamina (dubbed Kamina-ville), while a detached Swedish company took back roads to the city through Kiavie. At 06:20 the company spearheading the advance came under heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the Katangese two or three kilometers northeast of Kamina and was ordered by Major Sture Fagerström to retreat 600 meters. The Swedes took cover and regrouped while Fredman organised an armoured car unit. He arrived at the front lines at 07:05 and the peacekeepers began their attack. Supported with mortars, a combat patrol advanced down the road and by 07:55 it had broken through the gendarmerie's defences. Swedish medics attended to the wounded Katangese that were left behind while the rest of the forces began entering the city.

The Katangese Gendamerie conducted a disorganised withdrawal to two camps southeast of Kamina. Shortly after the 09:00 the Swedish battalion reached the city center. Patrols slowly mopped up resistance and took several prisoners. J-29 jets flew low to the ground to intimidate the remaining gendarmes and were hit by small arms fire in return. At 09:55 the Swedish troops attacked the nearest gendarmerie camp, encountering only sporadic resistance. At 13:00 they secured the second camp unopposed, as the remaining Katangese had fled. The Swedes commandeered it and began working with municipal authorities to stabilize the local situation. The Swedish battalion had sustained no casualties and had seized about 40 vehicles, two armoured cars, a <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors 40 mm gun</a>, a <a href="recoilless%20rifle">recoilless rifle</a>, several heavy machine guns, tons of ammunition, and a large amount of supplies.

The same day the 4th Battalion, <a href="Madras%20Regiment">Madras Regiment</a>, and members of the <a href="Rajputana%20Rifles">Rajputana Rifles</a> (both part of the <a href="99th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade">99th Indian Infantry Brigade</a>) moved out of Élisabethville for the <a href="Lufira%20River">Lufira River</a>. On 1 January 1963 they encountered several foreign mercenaries; in the ensuing gun battle four peacekeepers were killed. Two captured mercenaries revealed that confusion and desertion were occurring among the Katangese forces. Altogether the Indian forces faced unexpectedly light resistance and reached the east bank of the Lufira on 3 January.

The main bridge over the Lufira to Jadotville had been destroyed after the local mercenary commander blew up a truck parked halfway across it. UN forces bombarded the far side of the river with sporadic mortar fire. Though the shelling was mostly ineffectual, the mercenaries were unnerved by low-flying jets and withdrew to Jadotville after putting up minimal resistance. Meanwhile, UN troops stopped at the river bank to await the arrival of American bridging equipment, until they discovered a sabotaged rail bridge upstream that was still passable on foot. Brigadier Noronha, acting as the local commander, seized the opportunity and ordered the bridge to be secured. The Rajputana infantry crossed the bridge and swiftly neutralised Katangese opposition on the far side of the river. Meanwhile, the Madras battalion located a raft and, with the assistance of a <a href="Sikorsky%20Aircraft">Sikorsky</a> helicopter, brought over most of their vehicles and heavy equipment. Not wanting to remain at an exposed bridgehead, Noronha had his troops occupy Jadotville. General Moke had attempted to organise a defence of the town, but Katangese forces were in disarray, being completely caught off-guard by the UN troops' advance. The Indian soldiers faced no resistance and were warmly welcomed by the local inhabitants and UMHK mining staff. Only when Noronha was in the town did he contact the UN headquarters in Léopoldville. UN forces briefly stayed in Jadotville to regroup before advancing on Kolwezi, <a href="Sakania">Sakania</a>, and <a href="Dilolo">Dilolo</a>.

By 4 January 1963, the ONUC Air Division had conducted 76 air sorties, while patrolling by the J-29 jets had cut off Katanga from support in Angola and Southern Africa. Meanwhile, international opinion rallied in favour of ONUC. Belgium and France strongly urged Tshombe to accept Thant's Plan for National Reconciliation and resolve the conflict. Two days the later United States Air Force flew amphibious troop-carriers and armoured vehicles into Élisabethville. The 99th Indian Brigade had been waiting for their arrival, as the equipment was necessary in order to cross the dozen rivers and streams between Jadotville and Kolwezi. The troops began their advance three days later, but faced armed opposition and struggled to navigate the troop carriers through strong currents.

On 8 January, Tshombe reappeared in Élisabethville. The same day Prime Minister Adoula received a letter from the chiefs of the most prominent Kantangese tribes pledging allegiance to the Congolese government and calling for Tshombe's arrest. Thant, at the urging of the United States, considered making contact with Tshombe to negotiate. Bunche advised against this, saying to the secretary-general, "[Tshombe] is maneuvering in every possible way to get some recognition. His position, after all, is only that of a provincial president, and now, for the first time, he is reduced to size. He should be kept there." He shortly thereafter clarified his opinion, stating, "If we could convince [Tshombe] that there is no more room for maneuvering and bargaining, and no one to bargain with, he would surrender and the gendarmerie would collapse."

The following day Tshombe was briefly detained by UN soldiers, but he was released so he could meet with his minister of interior, <a href="Godefroid%20Munongo">Godefroid Munongo</a>, and several of his other cabinet officials in Mokambo. It was alleged that along the way Tshombe urged his supporters to resist UN forces, but, regardless, Mokambo and Bakania were soon occupied. He expressed his willingness to negotiate with the central government, but warned that any advance on Kolwezi would result in the enactment of a <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> policy. In accordance with the threat, the Delcommune and Le Marinel dams were prepared for demolition. On 10 January, UN troops seized an abandoned gendarmerie base and secured <a href="Shinkolobwe">Shinkolobwe</a>. Tshombe fled to Northern Rhodesia on a <a href="Rhodesian%20Air%20Force">Rhodesian Air Force</a> plane. Adoula and many ONUC officials were determined to keep him out of the country, but he managed to reach Kolwezi, the only significant location that remained under Katangese control.

Outside of the city several French mercenaries were skirmishing with UN troops when one patrol accidentally drove their jeep into a ditch. Nearby Indian <a href="Gurkha">Gurkha</a>s believed them to be Swedish peacekeepers and helped them retrieve their vehicle. One of the mercenaries then spoke in French and the Indians realised their mistake. A firefight ensued in which all but one of the mercenaries, desperate to avoid capture, escaped. 

Meanwhile, mercenaries in the Kolwezi had taken Tshombe's threats about a scorched earth policy seriously and had planted explosives on all nearby bridges, the <a href="Nzilo%20Dam">Nzilo Dam</a> (which provided most of Katanga's electricity), and most of the UMHK mining facilities. When Tshombe arrived on 12 January, he was informed by UMHK officials that they had negotiated a tax deal with the central government and were withdrawing their support for secession. They asked him to not spread the news, fearing the mercenaries would feel betrayed and destroy their facilities as revenge. Realising in a final meeting in Kolwezi that the situation was grim, Colonel <a href="Bob%20Denard">Bob Denard</a> suggested that, before fleeing, the mercenaries should destroy the Nzilo Dam to make a political statement. Tshombe, knowing that the UMHK would disapprove, told him that such an action would be "criminally irresponsible." Company representatives met with Brigadier General Noronha to discuss the best way for UN troops to enter Kolwezi without causing collateral damage. General Moke vainly attempted to organise the 140 mercenaries and 2,000 gendarmes under his command to prepare a final defence of the city. His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and a lack of discipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Discipline among the garrison increasingly faltered; in once instance, two mercenaries attempted to steal Puren's jeep. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of <a href="Baudouinville">Baudouinville</a> to surrender to besieging UN and "<a href="Arm%C3%A9e%20Nationale%20Congolaise">Armée Nationale Congolaise</a>" (ANC) forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near <a href="Kongolo%2C%20Katanga">Kongolo</a> laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.

On 15 January, Tshombe sent a formal message to Thant, "I am ready to proclaim immediately before the world that the Katanga's secession is ended." Munongo fled Kolwezi and angrily declared that he would continue the campaign from Rhodesia, though he soon returned. Tshombe offered to return to Élisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government. At a press conference, Adoula accepted Tshombe's proposition and announced that what remained of the Katangese Gendarmerie would be integrated into the ANC.

On 17 January, forward elements of the 99th Brigade reached the Tshilongo River where they were ordered to halt. Late that afternoon, Tshombe and Munongo met with UN officials in Élisabethville to finalise negotiations. They concluded with Tshombe signing a formal instrument of surrender with Major General Chand and acting UN Civilian Chief George Sherry, officially ending the Katangese secession. Four days later he peacefully received UN troops in Kolwezi led by Brigadier Noronha. Thant sent a congratulatory message to the peacekeeping forces, declaring that the conflict had been "forced upon [them]", adding that "it was only after all other efforts failed that the order was given to undertake defensive action of removing the hostile gendarmerie roadblocks which has now been completed so successfully and fortunately with a minimum of casualties." All the various political concerns about what ramifications a UN attempt to crush the secession might cause, such as a drawn-out <a href="guerrilla%20war">guerrilla war</a> or <a href="power%20vacuum">power vacuum</a>, were virtually resolved with the successful conclusion of Operation Grandslam. Most of the international community was satisfied with the result, including the United States, Belgium, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

A total of 10–11 UN peacekeepers were killed during the operation while 27–77 were wounded. This relatively low casualty rate greatly relieved Thant and his advisers. Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties are unknown. A total of seven UN fighter aircraft and a single reconnaissance aircraft were damaged by fire from the ground. In return, the <a href="Katangese%20Air%20Force">Katangese Air Force</a> had lost almost a dozen of its <a href="North%20American%20T-6%20Texan">Harvards</a>, <a href="Fouga%20CM.170%20Magister">Magisters</a>, and <a href="de%20Havilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a>s, most while on the ground. All Katangese combat aircraft, except for one or two Harvards, were recorded as destroyed by UN forces at the conclusion of Grandslam. General <a href="Christian%20Roy%20Kaldager">Christian Roy Kaldager</a>, commander of the ONUC Air Force, later said of the Grandslam air campaign, "We are very proud of it—it is the best memory I take away from the Congo."

A subsequent investigation by an ONUC intelligence team found that 15 aircraft had been hidden at Angolan airfields for use, in the words of captured Belgian mercenaries, "in the next fight for Katanga's secession". The operation also cut short a delivery of <a href="Cavalier%20Mustang">Cavalier Mustang</a>s which Tshombe had purchased and had been expected to arrive sometime in January. The UN was also able to confirm that Katanga had been able to acquire their aircraft with the knowledge and assistance of the governments of <a href="Portuguese%20Angola">Portuguese Angola</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a>.

The UN was unable to confirm reports of civilian casualties from the operation, allowing themselves to avoid much embarrassment in the press. However, statistics are ultimately unknown. According to a 1966 report prepared for the United States <a href="Arms%20Control%20and%20Disarmament%20Agency">Arms Control and Disarmament Agency</a>, two Belgian women were killed at a UN checkpoint at the outskirts of Jadotville by Indian peacekeepers after the male driver of the car they were in suddenly accelerated instead of stopping. The "unauthorised" shooting ostensibly "greatly embarrassed" UN officials. An American journalist in Katanga at the time also supported the assertion.

After the operation, a local priest sent a letter to the UN in protest of "the flagrant breach by U.N. troops of international conventions sacred to all civilised nations." He claimed that on 29 December Irish troops had fired upon patients in a ward of the Élisabethville "Union Minière" hospital at close range and that Ethiopian troops had killed 70 persons whose bodies were delivered to Prince Leopold Hospital before the end of 1962. The allegations were supported by Charles J. Bauer of the United States <a href="National%20Catholic%20Welfare%20Council">National Catholic Welfare Council</a> and Archbishop Joseph Cornelius of Brussels.

Robert Gardiner refuted both accusations in an open letter to the vicar general of the Roman Catholic archbishopric in Élisabethville. Writing on the first charge, he said that Irish troops were not even in the area at the time. Instead, he detailed that Ethiopian soldiers had stormed the hospital compound after being subjected to heavy firing from Katangese gendarmes who had dug in there. Gardiner reported that the nun on duty had said some of the patients were wearing khaki clothing similar to the gendarmes' uniforms. He conceded that one patient was shot in the leg while another received a grazing wound. Gardiner also said no protests of the presence of gendarmes was ever forwarded to the <a href="International%20Red%20Cross">International Red Cross</a> and that the <a href="Abbess">mother superior</a> of the hospital testified that medical authorities had been advised by "Union Minière" officials to refrain from taking any action against the gendarmes and to avoid involving themselves in the matter altogether. As for the 70 corpses brought to Prince Leopold Hospital, Gardiner stated that "[n]o evidence has been produced to substantiate this allegation."

The unexpected advance of the Indian forces under Brigadier Noronha into Jadotville on 3 January had created considerable international controversy and embarrassed Secretary-General Thant. Noronha had exceeded his initial orders by seizing a bridge and crossing over the Lufira River. Thant had guaranteed the British and the Belgians that such an advance would not occur, as both feared Tshombe would have UMHK property destroyed in retaliation. Ralphe Bunche had also given <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Secretary of State</a> <a href="Dean%20Rusk">Dean Rusk</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Nations">United States Ambassador to the United Nations</a> <a href="Adlai%20Stevenson%20II">Adlai Stevenson II</a> the impression that UN troops were not to undertake further action in Katanga without specific authorisation from Thant. ONUC commanders were apparently never informed of such assurances. The Americans consequentially believed that the Secretary-General had lost control over his forces. Bunche had sent a message to Gardiner, directing him to delay the UN advance until Tshombe's intentions could be clarified, but orders failed to reach Chand or Noronha through ONUC's out-dated communications system (the message was sent via commercial overland cable from Léopoldville). Gardiner trepidly responded by reporting the advance. Bunche then demanded an explanation as to why UN troops had supposedly disregarded Thant's orders. A UN spokesperson acknowledged that from a military perspective the operation had been "brilliantly executed" but stated that the UN regretted the "serious breakdown in effective communication and coordination between <a href="United%20Nations%20Headquarters">United Nations Headquarters</a> and the Léopoldville office."

The same day of the capture of Jadotville, Thant dispatched Bunche to the Congo to investigate the incident. Thant announced that Bunche's visit was for "a number of matters, political, military and administrative affecting the operation and its present and future activities," though his statement did little to disguise the reason for the trip from the international community. Upon his arrival in the country, Bunche read a hand-written statement to the press in which he assured them that the seizure of Jadotville was "part of the plan". 

Major General Chand was particularly anxious about Bunche's visit. Keenly aware of this, Bunche did his best to alleviate the general's worries, asking to stay at his residence in Élisabethville instead of a hotel. Chand was alarmed when Bunche presented him with a letter from Thant, but Bunche reached into his pocket and pulled out a suggested response. The general was surprised by the accuracy of the draft in its considerations of the military situation of UN troops during the advance, though the following day he gave Bunche a full explanation of what had occurred. In his official report on the events in Katanga, Bunche concluded, "I have found beyond doubt that it is our machinery that is at fault, far more than the individuals." He returned to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official apology from ONUC commanders. Thant later commented on the matter, writing, "I felt that it was I, not they, who should have apologised for my miscalculation and apprehensions based on scare reports from London and Brussels." According to UN official Eric S. Packham, it was unofficially suggested that the Indian government, in direct communication with Chand and impatient with the UN's progress in Katanga, unilaterally ordered Noronha's troops to seize Jadotville. Others rumoured that Gardiner had quietly approved of the action, or that Chand had deliberately delayed the halt order by directing all radio equipment to be deactivated.

At the time, the use of such robust force against Katanga, including aircraft, artillery, and armoured vehicles, aroused much controversy. Though personally dismayed by the violence as a <a href="Bhuddist">Bhuddist</a>, Thant thought the operation was justified. His reasoning for such strong action fell in line with <a href="just%20war%20theory">just war theory</a>. Proponents of Katanga argued that the secessionist movement was a legitimate exercise of <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a>. Thant refuted the idea in his memoirs, listing three primary objections: first, the Congo had been admitted into the UN in 1960 as a "unified state" with the written agreement of Tshombe. Second, "no sovereign state in the world ever recognised the independence of Katanga". Third, Tshombe's government was "never able to exercise effective control" over the entirety of the province. Military researcher <a href="Walter%20Dorn">Walter Dorn</a> speculated that Thant may have been personally sensitive to the issue of secession, having suffered from the bloody <a href="Karen%20conflict">Karen conflict</a> in his native <a href="Burma">Burma</a> and witnessed the consequences of the <a href="Partition%20of%20India">Partition of India</a>. Holding office during a time of widespread decolonisation in Africa and Asia, Thant was mindful of the precedent he was setting; recognising or encouraging secession in one country could allow it to spread to others with fractious consequences. As late as February 1970, he denounced secession, declaring that the UN "has never accepted and does not accept, and I do not believe it will ever accept, the principle of secession of a part of its Member State."

Thant also argued that ONUC had the enumerated authority to use force, <a href="Chapter%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20Charter">as specified</a> in the <a href="UN%20Charter">UN Charter</a> and permitted by the UN Security Council in its resolutions. He maintained that Grandslam was a matter of last resort, as Tshombe had frequently gone back on his promises and decisive action was only taken after sustained Katangese aggression against UN peacekeepers. Thant claimed that ONUC had used force "in self-defence under attack", though this was not strictly the case, as he had, in accordance with the Security Council resolutions, authorised UN troops to undertake offensive action. The forceful operation could also be considered proportional; Katanga possessed an organised gendarmerie with fighter jets, extensive weapon stockpiles, and a selection of mercenaries that disregarded the <a href="laws%20of%20war">laws of war</a> (i.e. by transporting weapons in vehicles marked with a <a href="red%20cross">red cross</a>).

With the end of the Katangese secession, much of the international community felt that ONUC had fulfilled its mandate and interest in maintaining the mission rapidly declined. In February following the reassertion of the central government's authority in Katanga, the UN began phasing out its peacekeeping force, with the goal of completing a total withdrawal by the end of the year. India was among the first countries to recall its troops. At the Congolese government's request, the UN authorised a six-month extension to ONUC's deployment, albeit with a reduced number of personnel. The last troops left the Congo on 30 June 1964. The civilian aid mission remained longer to provide technical assistance to the government.

Tshombe and all of his ministers remained in Katanga following the conclusion of hostilities. He promised on CONAKAT's behalf to support the reunification of the Congo. Control of the provincial police was formally passed to <a href="Joseph%20Il%C3%A9o">Joseph Iléo</a> on 5 February. As per the central government's decision, Katanga was divided into two provinces: North Katanga and South Katanga. Tshombe protested the "<a href="Balkanization">Balkanization</a>" of the province, but cooperated and established his own provincial government in South Katanga by April. Godefroid Munongo also remained in the Katangese government, though he was removed from the interior ministry and made provincial minister of health. Prime Minister Adoula reshuffled his cabinet to include four CONAKAT members, including their floor leaders from both houses of Parliament. The central government also assumed control of Katanga's shares in UMHK, as well its holdings in 18 other companies, facilitating a financial rapprochement with Belgium.

Tshombe's rivalry with "<a href="Association%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20des%20Baluba%20de%20Katanga">Association Générale des Baluba de Katanga</a>" (BALUBAKAT) leader <a href="Jason%20Sendwe">Jason Sendwe</a>, a northern Katangese politician, led to ethnic violence in Jadotville in which an estimated 74 people were killed. The following month ANC soldiers raided Tshombe's residence on accusations that he was maintaining a private militia. Later, the central government seized documents revealing his continued contact with foreign mercenaries. Fearing arrest and claiming political persecution, Tshombe fled to Paris, France, in June, eventually settling in Madrid, Spain. From there he developed plans with his gendarmerie commanders for a return to power, further complicating the central government's efforts to absorb the force.
Halfway through the year South Katanga was further divided into the provinces of Katanga Oriental and Lualaba (also known as the new South Katanga). Though they were opposed to such divisions, many Katangese leaders from the secession joined the new provincial governments. A new constitutional commission was established, and in March 1964 it recommended that the Congo switch from its <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary system</a> to a <a href="Presidential%20system">presidential model</a> of government.

In June 1964, following the withdrawal of ONUC, the communist Kwilu and <a href="Simba%20rebellion">Simba rebellion</a>s overwhelmed the ANC in eastern and central Congo. The weak central government was unable to effectively deal with the problem, so President <a href="Joseph%20Kasa-Vubu">Joseph Kasa-Vubu</a> dismissed Prime Minister Adoula and requested Tshombe to replace him. Tshombe arrived in the capital on 24 June and assumed the premiership on 9 July. The insurgencies were successfully quelled with the use of former gendarmes and mercenaries, but in October 1965 Kasa-Vubu dismissed Tshombe. In November, Colonel <a href="Joseph-Desir%C3%A9%20Mobutu">Joseph-Desiré Mobutu</a> seized power in a coup and Tshombe returned to exile in Spain. Though he had designs on a return to power, Tshombe was imprisoned in Algeria in 1967 and remained there until his death.

UN troops began disarming the remainder of the Katangese Gendarmerie after occupying Kolwezi. On 8 February 1963, General Norbert Moke and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu. In spite of the amnesty and incorporation of Katangese forces into the ANC, many gendarmes remained in hiding, occasionally clashing with government forces. Only 2,000 to 3,000 troops were successfully integrated into the ANC, while the 7,000 untrained gendarmes simply returned to their civilian livelihoods. Approximately 8,000 Katangese soldiers remained unaccounted for.

During the meeting in Kolwezi, Tshombe had ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. <a href="Jean%20Schramme">Jean Schramme</a> was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.

Throughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in "refugee" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>. Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces. Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the Kwilu and Simba rebels. They were used successfully against the insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in <a href="Stanleyville%20mutinies">a bloody mutiny</a> in July 1966.
Following their defeat, straggling gendarmes retreated back into Angola. Tshombe began planning to use them to stage an invasion of the Congo, but this was cut short by his imprisonment in Algeria in 1967. They reconstituted themselves as the "<a href="Front%20for%20Congolese%20National%20Liberation">Front de Libération Nationale Congolaise</a>" and made two attempts retake Katanga in the 1970s. Both failed, but <a href="Katanga%20insurgency">secessionist insurgency activity</a> continued. Hostilities resurfaced in 2006 after a <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">new national constitution</a>, which promulgated the division of Katanga into four new provinces, was adopted.

In 2011 a militant named <a href="G%C3%A9d%C3%A9on%20Kyungu%20Mutanga">Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga</a> broke out of prison. He remobilised local <a href="Mai%20Mai">Mai Mai</a> militias and formed the <a href="Mai%20Mai%20Kata%20Katanga">Mai Mai Kata Katanga</a> to achieve secession. Conflict in the region dramatically worsened, and in mid-2012 several UN humanitarian agencies began allocating numerous resources to help the civilian population. The <a href="United%20Nations%20Organization%20Stabilization%20Mission%20in%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (known as MONUSCO under its French name) provided logistical and advisory assistance to local government officials, police, and the military. Many Katangese people hoped that the UN would, in light of their role in ending the original secession, help resolve the situation. Kyungu and many of his forces surrendered in October 2016 to seek a peaceful solution.

Yugoslav torpedo boat T7

T7 was a sea-going <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> operated by the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> between 1921 and 1941, after spending <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> service. Originally 96 F, she was a <a href="250t-class%20torpedo%20boat">250t-class torpedo boat</a>, and saw active service during World War I, performing <a href="convoy">convoy</a>, patrol, escort and <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> tasks, and <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine operations</a>. Following <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>'s defeat in 1918, "96 F" was allocated to the Navy of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a>, which later became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed "T7". At the time, she and the seven other 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels of the fledgling maritime force. 

During the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, "T7" and the rest of the navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly ports, but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets. The ship was captured by the Italians during the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Italian Navy</a> under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a>. Following the Italian <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">capitulation</a> in September 1943, she was handed over by the Germans to the <a href="Navy%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Navy of the Independent State of Croatia</a>. She was driven aground by British <a href="motor%20torpedo%20boat">motor torpedo boat</a>s in June 1944 and destroyed by the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> to prevent her salvage.

In 1910, the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a coastal <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>, specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the <a href="Strait%20of%20Otranto">Strait of Otranto</a>, where the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> meets the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, would be <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> () base at the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bocche di Cattaro</a> (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. <a href="Steam%20turbine">Steam turbine</a> power was selected for propulsion, as <a href="Marine%20propulsion%23Reciprocating%20diesel%20engines">diesels</a> with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run <a href="Turbo-electric%20transmission">turbo-electric</a> boats. <a href="Stabilimento%20Tecnico%20Triestino">Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino</a> (STT) of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when <a href="Ganz%20Works">Ganz & Danubius</a> reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group. The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz & Danubius' main shipyard at <a href="Rijeka">Fiume</a>. "96 F" was the fifteenth boat of the F-group to be completed.

The <a href="250t-class%20torpedo%20boat">250t-class</a> F-group boats had a <a href="waterline%20length">waterline length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . While their designed <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a> was , they displaced about fully loaded. The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by two <a href="AEG">AEG</a>-Curtiss steam turbines driving two <a href="propeller">propeller</a>s, using steam generated by two <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, one of which burned <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and the other coal. The turbines were rated at with a maximum output of , and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of . They carried of coal and of fuel oil, which gave them a range of at . The F-group had two <a href="Funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Due to inadequate funding, "96 F" and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations. They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.

The boats were armed with two <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> <a href="%C5%A0koda%207%20cm%20guns"></a> L/30 guns, and four torpedo tubes. They could also carry 10–12 <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s. "96 F" was the second-to-last of its group to be completed, and was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 24 February 1915, <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 7 July 1916 and completed on 23 November of that year.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, "96 F" was used for <a href="convoy">convoy</a>, patrol, escort and <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> tasks, and <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine operations</a>. In 1917, one of the guns on each boat of the class was placed on an <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> mount. On the night of 11 May 1917, the , accompanied by "96 F" and two other 250t-class boats, were pursued in the northern Adriatic by an Italian force of five destroyers, but were able to retire to safety behind a minefield. On 3 June, the destroyers and "Csikós", along with "96 F" and another 250t-class boat, had a brief encounter with three Italian <a href="MAS%20%28motorboat%29">MAS boats</a> off the mouth of the <a href="Tagliamento">Tagliamento</a> river in the far north of the Adriatic.

"96 F" survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a> by which <a href="Republic%20of%20German-Austria">rump Austria</a> officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, "87 F," "93 F" and "97 F", and four 250t-class T-group boats, she was transferred in March 1921 to the Navy of the KSCS, which later became the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> (, KJRM). Renamed "T7" in KJRM service, she and the other seven 250t-class boats were, at the outset, the only modern sea-going vessels in the KJRM. In 1925, exercises were conducted off the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coast, involving the majority of the navy. In MayJune 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser "<a href="SMS%20Niobe">Dalmacija</a>", the <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a> "Hvar" and the submarines and , on a cruise to <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Malta">Malta</a>, the Greek island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> in the Ionian Sea, and <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a> in the <a href="French%20protectorate%20of%20Tunisia">French protectorate of Tunisia</a>. It is not clear if "T7" was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval <a href="attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.

In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when it was <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invaded</a> by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>. At the time of the invasion, "T7" was assigned as the flagship of the 3rd Torpedo Division located at <a href="%C5%A0ibenik">Šibenik</a>, which included her three F-group sisters. On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of <a href="Zadar">Zara</a> (Zadar) on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of <a href="Zaton%2C%20Zadar%20County">Zaton</a> into <a href="Lake%20Prokljan">Lake Prokljan</a>, where they remained until 11 April. On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at <a href="Milna">Milna</a> on the island of <a href="Bra%C4%8D">Brač</a>, and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor. All four F-group boats, including "T7", were captured by the Italians.

"T7" was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two <a href="Cannon%2076/40%20Model%201916">L/40 anti-aircraft guns</a>, but no other significant alterations were made to her. The Italians <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">capitulated</a> in September 1943, and once under German control, "T7" was handed over to the <a href="Navy%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Navy of the Independent State of Croatia</a>, serving under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came under the influence of the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a>, and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened. On 24 June 1944, she and the German <a href="E-boat">S-boats</a> "S 154" and "S 157" of the 7th S-Boat Flotilla were sailing between Šibenik and Rijeka, protecting German sea supply routes along the Adriatic, when they were attacked by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="Fairmile%20D%20motor%20torpedo%20boat">Fairmile D motor torpedo boat</a>s "MTB 659", "MTB 662" and "MTB 670" near the island of Kukuljari, south of <a href="Murter">Murter Island</a>. Considering "T7" one of the few significant threats to British boats in the region, the British commander ordered "MTB 670" to launch a torpedo attack. The two torpedoes missed, so the MTBs pursued and approached the ship from abaft the beam. "T7" opened fire at . The MTBs returned fire with their forward and port guns, and within 30 seconds they had disabled her weapons and set her ablaze. At a speed of about , "T7" suddenly veered starboard, narrowly avoiding a collision with "MTB 662" (it is not known whether her steering was damaged or if her crew was attempting to perform a ram) before running aground on Murter Island. The MTBs rescued 21 crew. The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more sailors and leaving her flooded and burning. A <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> demolition team destroyed the hulk to ensure it could not be salvaged.

The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of <a href="Sant%27Elpidio%20a%20Mare">Sant'Elpidio a Mare</a>. In 1917, one of her 66 mm guns was placed on an <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> mount. On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, "87 F" joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of <a href="Port%20of%20Ravenna">Porto Corsini</a>, <a href="Marotta%20%28village%29">Marotta</a> and <a href="Cesenatico">Cesenatico</a>.

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">German</a> and Austro-Hungarian <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s to get through the strait and into the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Miklós Horthy</a>, decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, scout cruisers, and destroyers. During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of <a href="Pula">Pola</a> in the upper Adriatic with the <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s and . At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the <a href="Boom%20%28navigational%20barrier%29">harbour defence barrage</a> opened, the dreadnoughts and , escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including "87 F", also departed Pola and set course for <a href="Slano">Slano</a>, north of <a href="Dubrovnik">Ragusa</a>, to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June, while returning from an uneventful patrol off the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coast, two <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Navy">Royal Italian Navy</a> () <a href="MAS%20%28boat%29">MAS boats</a>, "MAS 15" and "MAS 21", spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. "MAS 21" attacked "Tegetthoff", but her torpedoes missed. Under the command of <a href="Luigi%20Rizzo">Luigi Rizzo</a>, "MAS 15" fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit "Szent István". Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on "Szent István" were abreast her <a href="Fire%20room">boiler rooms</a>, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. "Szent István" <a href="capsized">capsized</a> less than three hours after being torpedoed. In October 1918, "87 F" was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.

"87 F" survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a> by which <a href="Republic%20of%20German-Austria">rump Austria</a> officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, "93 F", "96 F" and "97 F", and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> (, KJRM; Краљевска Југословенска Ратна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921, in KJRM service, "87 F" was renamed "T5". In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy. In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser "<a href="SMS%20Niobe">Dalmacija</a>", the <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a> "Hvar" and the submarines and , on a cruise to <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Malta">Malta</a>, the Greek island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> in the Ionian Sea, and <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a> in the <a href="French%20protectorate%20of%20Tunisia">French protectorate of Tunisia</a>. It is not clear if "T5" was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval <a href="attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.

In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when it was <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invaded</a> by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>. At the time of the invasion, "T5" was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at <a href="%C5%A0ibenik">Šibenik</a>, which included her three former F-group sisters. On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of <a href="Zadar">Zara</a> on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of <a href="Zaton%2C%20Zadar%20County">Zaton</a> into <a href="Lake%20Prokljan">Lake Prokljan</a>, where they remained until 11 April. On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at <a href="Milna">Milna</a> on the island of <a href="Bra%C4%8D">Brač</a>, and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor. All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.

"T5" was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two L/40 anti-aircraft guns, but no other significant alterations were made to her. After the Italians <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">capitulated</a> in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year. "T5" was commissioned by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> after the war, and renamed "Cer". She was fitted with two guns on single mounts and one gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.

Mother's Day (Rugrats)

"Mother's Day", also known as the "Rugrats Mother's Day Special" or "Rugrats Mother's Day", is the second episode of the fourth season of the American <a href="Animated%20series">animated</a> television series "<a href="Rugrats">Rugrats</a>" and the show's 67th episode overall. Released as a <a href="Mother%27s%20Day">Mother's Day</a> <a href="television%20special">special</a>, it revolves around the holiday from the perspective of a group of babies—<a href="Tommy%20Pickles">Tommy Pickles</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Rugrats%20characters%23Chuckie%20Finster">Chuckie Finster</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20Rugrats%20characters%23Phil%20and%20Lil%20DeVille">Phil and Lil Deville</a>. Tommy, Phil, and Lil attempt to find the perfect mother for Chuckie (who is raised only by his father <a href="Chaz%20Finster">Chaz</a>) while sharing their favorite memories about their moms. At the end of the episode, Chuckie's mother is revealed to have died of a terminal illness. It concludes with Chuckie and Chaz looking through a box of her belongings, including a poem she had written for her son. Meanwhile, <a href="Didi%20Pickles">Didi Pickles</a> tries to plan the perfect Mother's Day with her mom <a href="List%20of%20Rugrats%20characters%23Adults">Minka</a>, while <a href="Betty%20DeVille">Betty DeVille</a> helps <a href="Stu%20Pickles">Stu Pickles</a> with his invention to help mothers.

Norton Virgien and Toni Vian directed the episode from a script by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, <a href="David%20N.%20Weiss">David N. Weiss</a>, Susan Hood, and Ed Resto. Series co-creator <a href="Paul%20Germain">Paul Germain</a> had <a href="Pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitched</a> two potential storylines to explain the absence of Chuckie's mother, but <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> executives rejected his proposed ideas that the mother was either divorced from Chaz or had died. Before "Mother's Day" premiered, only minor references to Chuckie's mother had been made. Germain left the show in 1993, and several new writers replaced him. The concept was later revised and approved as a Mother's Day special. Germain said that he was disappointed at being unable to cover the topic during his time on the series.

Broadcast on May 6, 1997, in the United States, "Mother's Day" was one of several half-hour specials that Nickelodeon commissioned for "Rugrats". The episode was featured on the 1998 <a href="VHS">VHS</a> release "Rugrats: Mommy Mania", and was later made available for <a href="Digital%20distribution">digital download</a> along with the rest of the fourth season. "Mother's Day" was praised by critics and has been the subject of several retrospective reviews for its treatment of the death of a parent. It was also praised for its positive representation of <a href="breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> and expansion on the definition of motherhood. It won the <a href="CableACE%20Award">CableACE Award</a> for Writing a Children's Special or Series, and was nominated for the <a href="Humanitas%20Prize">Humanitas Prize</a> for the Children's Animation Category. The series received a nomination for a <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program">Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program</a> for the <a href="49th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">49th Primetime Emmy Awards</a> after Nickelodeon submitted "Mother's Day" for consideration.

On <a href="Mother%27s%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Mother's Day</a>, toddler <a href="Angelica%20Pickles">Angelica Pickles</a> constructs a <a href="macaroni">macaroni</a> sculpture of her head as a present to her mother, telling <a href="List%20of%20Rugrats%20characters%23Main%20characters">the Rugrats</a> the meaning of the holiday. After dropping off his son <a href="Chuckie%20Finster">Chuckie</a>, <a href="Chaz%20Finster">Chaz Finster</a> gives his friend <a href="Didi%20Pickles">Didi Pickles</a> a box of his wife's belongings as he fears that Chuckie will find it. Chaz does not feel he is ready to talk to Chuckie about his mother. While helping the other babies <a href="Phil%20and%20Lil">Phil and Lil DeVille</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Pickles">Tommy Pickles</a> look for the perfect gifts for their mothers, Chuckie feels uncertain about how he should celebrate Mother's Day. Tommy, Phil, and Lil share their favorite memories of their mothers with Chuckie. Phil and Lil say that the best gift they gave their mom was their first laugh. Tommy reminisces about his mom comforting him while he was in a <a href="neonatal%20intensive%20care%20unit">neonatal intensive care unit</a>. The babies think of a plan to find Chuckie a new mother. Their attempts to have Tommy's dog <a href="Spike%20%28Rugrats%29">Spike</a> and Lil act as his mom are unsuccessful. Angelica agrees to act as Chuckie's mother only if he completes her macaroni sculpture. Meanwhile, Didi takes her mom <a href="List%20of%20Rugrats%20characters%23Adults">Minka</a> to a <a href="health%20spa">spa</a>, and <a href="Betty%20DeVille">Betty DeVille</a> helps <a href="Stu%20Pickles">Stu Pickles</a> with his invention to help mothers.

Angelica tasks Chuckie to pick a <a href="dandelion">dandelion</a> to decorate her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys a majority of the lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a <a href="spade">spade</a>, a journal of <a href="Pressed%20flower%20craft">pressed flowers</a>, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.

The 23-minute and 46-second episode was written by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, <a href="David%20N.%20Weiss">David N. Weiss</a>, Susan Hood, and Ed Resto. Directed by Norton Virgien and Toni Vian, it was produced by the animation studio <a href="Klasky%20Csupo">Klasky Csupo Productions</a>, a part of <a href="Nickelodeon%20Animation%20Studio">Nickelodeon Animation Studio</a>. Cella Nichols Duffy, Gabor Csupo, <a href="Arlene%20Klasky">Arlene Klasky</a>, Paul De Meyer, Stem, and Weiss also produced the episode. <a href="Mark%20Mothersbaugh">Mark Mothersbaugh</a> and <a href="Ruby%20Andrews">Ruby Andrews</a> contributed to the music. In 2016, co-creator <a href="Paul%20Germain">Paul Germain</a> revealed that the concept for the episode, and the discussion about the status of Chuckie's mother, was previously <a href="Pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitched</a> to <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> executives. She was not included in the first season to avoid the need to animate a completely new character. During the production of the show's second and third seasons, Germain noticed that questions about the character's absence became more prominent. He consulted with fellow co-creator Arlene Klasky, and they concluded that the only two possible ways to address the character was that she was divorced from Chaz, or had died before the series' debut.

Germain and Klasky initially planned to portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers. The studio also vetoed a reveal that the mother was dead, contending that such an idea would be "scary" and that "children [would not] want to see that." Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: "We mention that she exists but we don't tell you what happened to her. We even made a joke out of it in one episode. But we weren't allowed to go into the subject." Even when the show did portray Chuckie's mother as having died from a terminal illness, the word "dead" was never used by any of the characters. The character had been briefly mentioned before in the episodes "<a href="Real%20or%20Robots%3F">Real or Robots?</a>" (1991), "<a href="Chuckie%20vs.%20the%20Potty">Chuckie vs. the Potty</a>" (1992), and "<a href="My%20Friend%20Barney">My Friend Barney</a>" (1993).

Germain left the series in 1993, and several new writers replaced him. At that time, Nickelodeon permitted the writers and animators to include a storyline about the death of Chuckie's mother. The development of the "Rugrats" Mother's Day television special was announced on December 7, 1996. <a href="Kim%20Cattrall">Kim Cattrall</a> provided the voice for Chuckie's mother, Melinda Finster. Germain described the episode as "this whole very maudlin thing," and said that he was disappointed over his inability to cover the topic. He explained: "I just sat there thinking, 'We weren't allowed to do this, and now you guys are doing it.' That's something I regret." Mary Harrington, a supervising producer of animation for Nickelodeon, described it as one of her favorite episodes of "Rugrats", and commended the writers and producers for their handling of the subject matter.

"Mother's Day", also promoted as "Rugrats Mother's Day Special", was originally broadcast in the United States at 8:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Time</a> on May 6, 1997 on Nickelodeon. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" Lee Margulies recommended the special as appropriate for children between the ages of four and eight. The episode was one of several half-hour specials created for "Rugrats", with others including "<a href="The%20Santa%20Experience">The Santa Experience</a>" (1992), "<a href="A%20Rugrats%20Passover">A Rugrats Passover</a>" (1993/1995) and "<a href="A%20Rugrats%20Chanukah">A Rugrats Chanukah</a>" (1996). According to writer Jeff Lenburg, the show's specials, including "Mother's Day", earned high ratings.

"Mother's Day" was featured on the <a href="VHS">VHS</a> release "Rugrats: Mommy Mania", which came out on January 4, 1998"." It was included on the 2011 <a href="DVD">DVD</a> package of the show's fourth season, with the press release listing it as one of the "special episodes". A writer from <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> argued that the episode should also have been featured on the 2004 DVD release "Rugrats Holiday Celebration" given the lack of content on the collection's second disc. The releases were distributed by <a href="Viacom">Viacom</a>. The episode was later made purchasable as a <a href="Digital%20distribution">digital download</a> on the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> and <a href="Amazon%20Video">Amazon Video</a>, along with the rest of the fourth season. It is also available on <a href="streaming%20media">streaming</a> <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> services, such as <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a>.

In 1998, Eric Schmuckler of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" pointed to the "Mother's Day" special as an example of the show's balance between featuring an "always sunny and usually silly" tone while also being "poignant". Schmuckler described Chaz's interactions with Chuckie as "an age-appropriate version of the loss of his mother". "Rugrats" was nominated for the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program">Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program</a> for the <a href="49th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">49th Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, after Nickelodeon submitted the special for consideration, but lost to "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>". The episode was also nominated for the <a href="Humanitas%20Prize">Humanitas Prize</a> for the Children's Animation Category in 1998, which went to the "<a href="Life%20with%20Louie">Life with Louie</a>" episode "Blinded by Love". Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, and David N. Weiss received the <a href="CableACE%20Award">CableACE Award</a> for Writing a Children's Special or Series for their contributions to the episode.

"Mother's Day" has been the subject of several retrospective reviews of the series. Philip Lewis of Arts.Mic praised the episode as an example of Nickelodeon's potential to cover a serious subject, noting its treatment of "the loss of a parent" as one of the series' most memorable moments. <a href="Moviepilot">Moviepilot</a>'s Kristy Anderson wrote that the development of Chuckie's backstory was a surprise as "[f]ew would have expected to be confronted by the topic of death while watching a cartoon about babies". In their book "Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim", authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin echoed Anderson's sentiment, commenting that the episode could "hit you like a truck if you let it".

"Mother's Day" has been cited in several lists of commentators' favorite episodes or moments from "Rugrats". Anderson placed it on her list of must-watch episodes from the show's third, fourth, and fifth seasons, suggesting that "[y]ou will need tissues". The poem written and narrated by Chuckie's mother was praised by Moviepilot's Daniel Pearson, and was included in a list of the top eight most heartfelt moments in animated television by Mara Mullikin of the same publication. Victor Beigelman of <a href="A%20Plus%20%28aplus.com%29">A Plus</a> put the episode on his list of seven Mother's Day-themed television episodes, citing it as a "heavy dose of nostalgia".

Critics have also commented on other aspects of the episode. In 2016, Caroline Bologna from "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" praised the episode for showing "a joyful depiction of <a href="breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a>" and for normalizing it to a wider audience. Bologna contrasted the scene with the lack of images of breastfeeding in contemporary children's television, writing that the show had a "positive legacy" and proved that "this topic was deemed perfectly suitable for a children's show 20 years ago". Priscilla Blossom of the motherhood website Romper.com also praised the scene as addressing <a href="reproductive%20health">reproductive health</a>, along with the portrayal of Tommy's premature birth and time in a neonatal intensive care unit. In their 2013 essay "What Is a Mother? Gay and Lesbian Perspectives on Parenting", scholars <a href="Jack%20Drescher">Jack Drescher</a>, Deborah F. Glazer, Lee Crespi, and David Schwartz analyzed "Mother's Day" as an extension of <a href="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalyst</a> <a href="Donald%20Winnicott">Donald Winnicott</a>'s theories on early childhood. They highlighted Chuckie's realization that his father acts like a mother as "a moment of <a href="Postmodernism">postmodern</a> insight" that expands the definition of motherhood.

High Explosive Research

High Explosive Research was the British project to independently develop <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s after the Second World War. This decision was taken by a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20cabinet%20committee">cabinet sub-committee</a> on 8 January 1947, in response to apprehension of an American return to <a href="United%20States%20isolationism">isolationism</a>, fears that Britain might lose its <a href="great%20power">great power</a> status, and the actions by the United States to unilaterally withdraw from sharing of nuclear technology under the 1943 <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a>. The decision was publicly announced in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> on 12 May 1948.

The project was a civil, not a military, one. Staff were drawn from and recruited into the <a href="Civil%20Service%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Service</a>, and were paid Civil Service salaries. It was headed by <a href="Lord%20Portal">Lord Portal</a>, as Controller of Production, Atomic Energy, in the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a>. An <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Research%20Establishment">Atomic Energy Research Establishment</a> was located at a former airfield, <a href="Harwell%2C%20Oxfordshire">Harwell</a>, in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, under the direction of <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a>. The first nuclear reactor in the UK, a small <a href="research%20reactor">research reactor</a> known as <a href="GLEEP">GLEEP</a>, went <a href="Criticality%20%28status%29">critical</a> at Harwell on 15 August 1947. British staff at the <a href="Montreal%20Laboratory">Montreal Laboratory</a> designed a larger reactor, known as BEPO, which went critical on 5 July 1948. They provided experience and expertise that would later be employed on the larger, production reactors.

Production facilities were constructed under the direction of <a href="Christopher%20Hinton%2C%20Baron%20Hinton%20of%20Bankside">Christopher Hinton</a>, who established his headquarters in a former <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20Factory">Royal Ordnance Factory</a> at <a href="ROF%20Risley">Risley</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. These included a <a href="uranium">uranium</a> metal plant at <a href="Springfields">Springfields</a>, <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s and a <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> processing plant at <a href="Windscale">Windscale</a>, and a <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> <a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a> facility at <a href="Capenhurst">Capenhurst</a>, near <a href="Chester">Chester</a>. The two Windscale reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. The gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst began producing <a href="highly%20enriched%20uranium">highly enriched uranium</a> in 1954.

<a href="William%20George%20Penney">William Penney</a> directed bomb design from <a href="Fort%20Halstead">Fort Halstead</a>. In 1951 his design group moved to a new site at <a href="Atomic%20Weapons%20Establishment">Aldermaston</a> in Berkshire. The first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">Operation Hurricane</a>, during which it was detonated on board the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> anchored off the <a href="Monte%20Bello%20Islands">Monte Bello Islands</a> in Australia on 3 October 1952. Britain thereby became the third country to test nuclear weapons, after the United States and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The project concluded with the delivery of the first of its <a href="Blue%20Danube%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Blue Danube</a> atomic bombs to <a href="Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> in November 1953, but British hopes of a renewed nuclear <a href="Special%20Relationship">Special Relationship</a> with the United States were frustrated. The technology had been superseded by the American development of the <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>, which was <a href="Ivy%20Mike">first tested</a> in November 1952, only one month after Operation Hurricane. Britain would go on to develop its <a href="British%20hydrogen%20bomb%20programme">own hydrogen bombs</a>, which it first tested in 1957. A year later, the United States and Britain resumed <a href="1958%20US%E2%80%93UK%20Mutual%20Defence%20Agreement">nuclear weapons cooperation</a>.

The <a href="neutron">neutron</a> was discovered by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> at the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in February 1932. In April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Walton">Ernest Walton</a> split <a href="lithium">lithium</a> atoms with accelerated <a href="proton">proton</a>s. <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> and his team in Rome conducted experiments involving the bombardment of elements by slow neutrons, which produced heavier <a href="Chemical%20element">elements</a> and <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s. Then, in December 1938, <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> at Hahn's laboratory in <a href="Berlin-Dahlem">Berlin-Dahlem</a> bombarded <a href="uranium">uranium</a> with slowed neutrons, and discovered that <a href="barium">barium</a> had been produced, and therefore that the uranium <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> had been split. Hahn wrote to his colleague <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>, who, with her nephew <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a>, developed a theoretical justification for the process, which they published in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" in 1939. By analogy with the <a href="Fission%20%28biology%29">division of biological cells</a>, they named the process "<a href="nuclear%20fission">fission</a>".

The discovery of fission raised the possibility that an extremely powerful <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> could be created. The term was already familiar to the British public through the writings of <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, in his 1913 novel "<a href="The%20World%20Set%20Free">The World Set Free</a>". <a href="George%20Paget%20Thomson">George Paget Thomson</a>, at <a href="Imperial%20College%20London">Imperial College London</a>, and <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, an Australian physicist at the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>, were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing; but at Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a strikingly different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a> and Frisch, who could not work on the university's secret projects like <a href="radar">radar</a> because they were <a href="enemy%20alien">enemy alien</a>s and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. They calculated the <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of a metallic sphere of pure <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a>, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.

Oliphant took the <a href="Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls%20memorandum">Frisch–Peierls memorandum</a> to Sir <a href="Henry%20Tizard">Henry Tizard</a>, the chairman of the <a href="Tizard%20Committee">Tizard Committee</a>, and the <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a> was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. A new directorate known by the deliberately misleading name of <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> was created to coordinate this effort. Sir <a href="John%20Anderson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Waverley">John Anderson</a>, the <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a>, became the minister responsible, and <a href="Wallace%20Akers">Wallace Akers</a> from <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.

In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, and Cockcroft, as part of the <a href="Tizard%20Mission">Tizard Mission</a>, briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, <a href="Frederick%20L.%20Hovde">Frederick L. Hovde</a>, the head of the London liaison office of the American <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD), raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and <a href="Lord%20Cherwell">Lord Cherwell</a>, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by <a href="atomic%20spies">atomic spies</a> for the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.
The United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised the Prime Minister, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, that: "We must face the fact that ... [our] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none."

The British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but the project would have needed overwhelming priority, the projected cost was staggering, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">war in Europe</a>. The unanimous response was that before embarking on this, another effort should be made to secure American cooperation. At the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quadrant Conference</a> in August 1943, Churchill and the American President, <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a>, signed the <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a>, which merged the two national projects. Its terms made it clear that Britain was the junior partner in the <a href="Grand%20Alliance%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Grand Alliance</a>. The British considered the Quebec Agreement to be the best deal they could have struck under the circumstances, and the restrictions were the price they had to pay to obtain the technical information needed for a successful post-war nuclear weapons project. <a href="Margaret%20Gowing">Margaret Gowing</a> noted that the "idea of the independent deterrent was already well entrenched."

The Quebec Agreement established the <a href="Combined%20Policy%20Committee">Combined Policy Committee</a> and the <a href="Combined%20Development%20Trust">Combined Development Trust</a> to coordinate their efforts. The 19 September 1944 <a href="Hyde%20Park%20Aide-M%C3%A9moire">Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire</a> extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period. A British mission led by Akers assisted in the development of <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> technology at the <a href="SAM%20Laboratories">SAM Laboratories</a> in New York. Another, led by Oliphant, who acted as deputy director at the <a href="Berkeley%20Radiation%20Laboratory">Berkeley Radiation Laboratory</a>, assisted with the <a href="electromagnetic%20separation">electromagnetic separation</a> process. Cockcroft became the director of the Anglo-Canadian <a href="Montreal%20Laboratory">Montreal Laboratory</a>. The British mission to the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> led by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a>, and later Peierls, included distinguished scientists such as <a href="G.%20I.%20Taylor">Geoffrey Taylor</a>, <a href="James%20L.%20Tuck">James Tuck</a>, <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, <a href="William%20George%20Penney">William Penney</a>, Frisch, <a href="Ernest%20Titterton">Ernest Titterton</a> and <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a>, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves">Leslie R. Groves</a>, the director of the Manhattan Project. He ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.

With the end of the war the <a href="Special%20Relationship">Special Relationship</a> between Britain and the United States "became very much less special". The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which it considered a joint discovery. On 8 August 1945 the Prime Minister, <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, sent a message to President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> in which he referred to themselves as "heads of the Governments which have control of this great force". Roosevelt had died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire was not binding on subsequent administrations. In fact, the American copy was temporarily physically lost. When Field Marshal <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a> raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of <a href="Vice%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Wilson%20Brown%20%28admiral%29">Wilson Brown, Jr.</a>, Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, and thought it had something to do with naval guns.

On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</a>, <a href="Mackenzie%20King">Mackenzie King</a>, went to Washington, D.C., to confer with Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. A Memorandum of Intention they signed replaced the Quebec Agreement. It made Canada a full partner; continued the Combined Policy Committee and Combined Development Trust; and reduced the obligation to obtain consent for the use of nuclear weapons to merely requiring consultation. The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes for a resumption of cooperation on nuclear energy were disappointed. The Americans soon made it clear that cooperation was restricted to basic scientific research.

The next meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 produced no accord on collaboration, and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee. Truman cabled on 20 April that he did not see the communiqué he had signed as obligating the United States to assist Britain in designing, constructing and operating an atomic energy plant. The passing of the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a> (McMahon Act) in August 1946, which was signed by Truman on 1 August 1946, and went into effect at midnight on 1 January 1947, ended technical cooperation. Its control of "restricted data" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist <a href="Alan%20Nunn%20May">Alan Nunn May</a>, who had worked in the Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.

Attlee had created a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20cabinet%20committee">cabinet sub-committee</a>, the <a href="Gen%2075%20Committee">Gen 75 Committee</a> (known informally by Attlee as the "Atomic Bomb Committee"), on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of a nuclear weapons programme. To provide technical advice, Attlee created an Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy, with Anderson as its chairman. Anderson was an <a href="Independent%20%28politician%29">independent</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for the <a href="Combined%20Scottish%20Universities%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Scottish Universities</a> who sat on the <a href="Opposition%20Front%20Bench">Opposition Front Bench</a>. As chairman of the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy, Anderson had his own office in the <a href="Cabinet%20Office">Cabinet Office</a>, and the services of its secretariat. He accompanied Attlee on his November 1945 trip to the United States. A 2 September 1945 study of "The Influence of the Atomic Bomb on War" forecast that an enemy could build 500 bombs during ten years of peace, and warned that if 10 percent of the arsenal was used on the United Kingdom, "over night the main base of the British Empire could be rendered ineffective", with enough left for other British forces around the world.

In October 1945, the Gen 75 Committee considered the issue of ministerial responsibility for atomic energy. The <a href="Cabinet%20Secretary%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Cabinet Secretary</a>, Sir <a href="Edward%20Bridges%2C%201st%20Baron%20Bridges">Edward Bridges</a>, and the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy both recommended that it be placed within the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a>. Developing atomic energy would require an enormous construction effort, which the Ministry of Supply was best equipped to undertake. The Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the <a href="Department%20of%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Scientific and Industrial Research</a> to the Ministry of Supply effective 1 November 1945. To coordinate the atomic energy effort, it was decided to appoint a Controller of Production, Atomic Energy (CPAE). The <a href="Minister%20of%20Supply">Minister of Supply</a>, <a href="John%20Wilmot%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wilmot%20of%20Selmeston">John Wilmot</a>, suggested <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Royal%20Air%20Force">Marshal of the Royal Air Force</a> <a href="Lord%20Portal">Lord Portal</a>, the wartime <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Air%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>. Portal was reluctant to accept the post, as he felt that he lacked administrative experience outside the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, but eventually accepted it for a two-year term, commencing in March 1946. In this role he had direct access to the Prime Minister. Portal ran the project until 1951, when he was succeeded by Sir <a href="Frederick%20E.%20Morgan">Frederick Morgan</a>. He established his headquarters at <a href="Shell%20Mex%20House">Shell Mex House</a> on the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand, London</a>, where the wartime Tube Alloys had been. Special security barriers were installed to close off this section of the offices, giving the area the nickname "the Cage".
With Portal's appointment came consideration of splitting Anderson's committee, which functioned as both an advisory and an interdepartmental body. In August 1946, a new standing committee was created, the Atomic Energy Official Committee, which assumed the interdepartmental function. In March 1947, <a href="Roger%20Makins%2C%201st%20Baron%20Sherfield">Roger Makins</a> became its chairman. Anderson's committee declined in influence, and was disbanded when he departed at the end of 1947. During the war, <a href="Christopher%20Hinton%2C%20Baron%20Hinton%20of%20Bankside">Christopher Hinton</a> had been seconded from <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">ICI</a> to the Ministry of Supply and had become Deputy Director General of <a href="Filling%20Factories%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Filling Factories</a>. He was due to return to ICI at the end of the year, but agreed to oversee the design, construction and operation of the new facilities at a salary far below that offered by ICI. He established his headquarters in a former <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20Factory">Royal Ordnance Factory</a> at <a href="ROF%20Risley">Risley</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> on 4 February 1946. Portal also created a position of Deputy Controller (Technical Policy), to which he appointed <a href="Michael%20Perrin">Michael Perrin</a>. This created ill-feeling, as Perrin had been junior to Hinton at ICI. Portal also created a Technical Committee to replace the old Tube Alloys Technical Committee. To give the Ministry of Supply's control over atomic energy a legal form, a bill was introduced into the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> on 1 May 1946 that became law as the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%201946">Atomic Energy Act 1946</a> on 6 November 1946.

During the war, Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant, Peierls, <a href="Harrie%20Massey">Harrie Massey</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Wakefield%20Banks%20Skinner">Herbert Skinner</a> had met in Washington, DC, in November 1944, and drawn up a proposal for a British atomic energy research establishment, which they had calculated would cost around £1.5 million. The Tube Alloys Committee endorsed their recommendation in April 1945, and Attlee announced its creation in the House of Commons on 29 October 1945, informing the House that it would cost about £1 million to build and £500,000 per annum to run. The obvious choices for a director of the new establishment were Chadwick and Cockcroft, and the former urged that the latter be appointed. Cockcroft agreed, subject to stipulation in writing that he would be answerable only to the Minister and his <a href="Permanent%20Secretary">Permanent Secretary</a>, and, except where subject to requirements for military secrecy, the establishment would be run like a university, with free exchange of views and the publication of papers. His appointment was announced in November 1945, although he did not leave Canada until September 1946. The <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Research%20Establishment">Atomic Energy Research Establishment</a> (AERE) did not come under Portal's control until January 1950. A committee selected a site for the AERE at <a href="RAF%20Harwell">RAF Harwell</a>, an airfield about south of <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. The airfield was a modern one, with a long runway, and the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> was reluctant to release it until the Prime Minister intervened.

Responsibility for the development of atomic bombs lay outside the realm of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a>. One reason for this was that it was only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the <a href="Chief%20Scientific%20Adviser%20to%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Defence">Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence</a> in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.

An early debate among the scientists was whether the <a href="fissile%20material">fissile material</a> for an atomic bomb should be uranium-235 or <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>. Tube Alloys had performed much of the pioneering research on gaseous diffusion for <a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a>, and Oliphant's team in Berkeley were well-acquainted with the electromagnetic process. The staff that had remained in Britain strongly favoured uranium-235; but the scientists that had worked in the United States argued for plutonium on the basis of its greater efficiency as an explosive, despite the fact that they had neither the expertise in the design of <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s to produce it, nor the requisite knowledge of plutonium <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> or <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a> to extract it. However, the Montreal Laboratory had designed and was building pilot reactors, and had carried out some work on separating plutonium from uranium. The Manhattan Project had pursued both avenues, and the scientists who had worked at Los Alamos were aware of work there with composite <a href="Pit%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">cores</a> that used both; but there were concerns that Britain might not have the money, resources or skilled manpower for this. In the end, it came down to economics; a reactor could be built more cheaply than a separation plant that produced an equivalent quantity of enriched uranium, and made more efficient use of uranium fuel. A reactor and separation plant capable of producing enough plutonium for fifteen bombs per year was costed at around £20 million. The facility was approved by the Gen 75 committee on 18 December 1945 "with the highest urgency and importance".
A few months later, Portal, who had not been appointed when this decision was taken, began to have doubts. Word reached him of problems with the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a> reactors, which had been all but completely shut down due to <a href="Wigner%27s%20disease">Wigner's disease</a>. On a visit to the United States in May 1946, Groves advised Portal not to build a reactor. By this time, there was interest from the scientists in making better use of uranium fuel by re-enrichment of spent fuel rods. A gaseous diffusion plant was costed at somewhere between £30 and £40 million. The Gen 75 Committee considered the proposal in October 1946. Perrin, who was present, later recalled that:

Penney had joined the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1944, and had served on the Target Committee that had selected cities to be attacked. He had been in the observation plane "<a href="Big%20Stink%20%28B-29%29">Big Stink</a>" during the <a href="bombing%20of%20Nagasaki">bombing of Nagasaki</a>, and had done damage assessment on the ground following Japan's surrender. He had returned to England in November 1945 intending to resume his academic career, but was approached by <a href="C.%20P.%20Snow">C. P. Snow</a>, one of the <a href="Civil%20Service%20Commissioners%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Service Commissioners</a>, and asked to become Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, pronounced "Caesar"), in charge of the Ministry of Supply's Armaments Research Department (ARD) at <a href="Fort%20Halstead">Fort Halstead</a> in Kent. His appointment as CSAR was announced on 1 January 1946, but Groves asked him to assist in the American <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> nuclear tests at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a>. Penney left for the United States in March 1946, and did not return to Britain until October 1946. Portal then asked him to draw up a scheme for an Atomic Weapons Section within the Armaments Research Department which would design, develop and construct atomic bombs. In his 1 November 1946 report to Portal, which he had to type himself for security reasons, Penney provided a proposed organisation chart, detailed his staffing requirements, and listed his accommodation requirements, which he felt could be met at Fort Halstead, the <a href="Royal%20Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a> at <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, and <a href="MoD%20Shoeburyness">Shoeburyness</a>.
In July 1946, the <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> considered the issue of nuclear weapons, and recommended that Britain acquire them. This recommendation was accepted by the Cabinet Defence Committee on 22 July 1946. The Chief of the Air Staff, <a href="Arthur%20Tedder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tedder">Lord Tedder</a>, officially requested an atomic bomb on 9 August 1946. The Chiefs of Staff estimated that 200 bombs would be required by 1957. Despite this, and the research and construction of facilities that had already been approved, there was still no official decision to proceed with making atomic bombs. Portal submitted his proposal to do so at the 8 January 1947 meeting of the Gen 163 Committee, another "ad hoc" committee, which agreed to proceed with the development of atomic bombs. It also endorsed Portal's proposal to place Penney in charge of the bomb development effort, although Penney was not informed of this decision until May. Of the decision, <a href="Margaret%20Gowing">Margaret Gowing</a> wrote:

This represented deep-rooted British political and strategic ideas. The war had left Britain impoverished. Its gold and dollar reserves had been depleted. A third of its merchant ships now lay on the bottom of the ocean. About 250,000 homes had been destroyed and another 3 million had been damaged while hardly any had been built for years. In early 1947, factories suspended production for want of coal. The United States had abruptly terminated <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> when the war ended. In its place was a $3.75 billion <a href="Anglo-American%20loan">loan from the United States</a> and a $1.25 billion loan from Canada, most of which had been spent by August 1947. Nonetheless, there remained an implacable belief that the future would be like the past. Bevin told the House of Commons on 16 May 1947 that: 

In his 1961 memoirs, Attlee explained his decision:
The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948 by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Minister of Defence</a>, <a href="A.%20V.%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Hillsborough">Albert Alexander</a>, albeit in an oblique answer to a pre-arranged question from <a href="George%20Jeger">George Jeger</a>, a <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> <a href="backbencher">backbencher</a>. <a href="D%20notice">D notice</a> No. 25 prohibited the publication of details on the design, construction or location of atomic weapons. The project was hidden under the cover name "Basic High Explosive Research". "Basic" was soon dropped and it became simply "High Explosive Research" (HER).

There was no known alternative fuel for nuclear reactors other than uranium, so securing an adequate supply was crucial to the British atomic energy programme. During the war, Britain took the lead in reopening the world's richest uranium mine, the <a href="Shinkolobwe">Shinkolobwe</a> mine in the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a>, which had been flooded and closed, as 30 percent of the stock in <a href="Union%20Mini%C3%A8re%20du%20Haut%20Katanga">Union Minière du Haut Katanga</a>, the company that owned the mine, was controlled by British interests. In May 1944, Sir John Anderson and US Ambassador <a href="John%20Winant">John Winant</a> negotiated a deal with the <a href="Belgian%20government%20in%20exile">Belgian government in exile</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Sengier">Edgar Sengier</a>, the director of Union Minière, for the mine to be reopened and of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound. American and British leaders concluded that it was in their best interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The Combined Development Trust was established for this purpose on 14 June 1944. It consisted of three American, two British and one Canadian members, with an American, initially Groves, as chairman. By the end of the war, it had control of 97 per cent of the world's uranium and 65 per cent of the <a href="thorium">thorium</a>.
During the war, all the uranium from the Congo had gone to the United States, as had that captured in Europe by the <a href="Alsos%20Mission">Alsos Mission</a>, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would only pay for what they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in <a href="pound%20sterling">sterling</a>, while receiving reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States in dollars, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.

By the end of 1946, Britain had received , and another 500 was stockpiled for the Trust at <a href="Springfields">Springfields</a>, near Preston in Lancashire. Uranium ore was stockpiled in Britain because the McMahon Act did not permit it to be exported from the United States. Groves extended the arrangement into 1947, and another was shipped to Britain, all of which was added to the Springfields stockpile. Its growing size was the principal reason the Americans reopened the negotiations resulting in the "Modus Vivendi", which allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada. Under this agreement, all the Congo ore from 1948 and 1949 was shipped to the United States. The Trust was renamed the <a href="Combined%20Development%20Agency">Combined Development Agency</a> in January 1948.

The <a href="Joe%201">first Soviet atomic bomb test</a> in August 1949 was embarrassing to the British (who had not expected a Soviet atomic weapon until 1954) for having been beaten, but it was for the Americans another reason for cooperation. The agreement on raw materials was due to expire at the end of the year. The Americans offered to make bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to end their atomic bomb programme. This offer was rejected on the grounds that it was not "compatible with our status as a first class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance." Instead, the British suggested that there would be a full exchange of atomic information, and in return for ending the production of atomic bombs in Britain, American bombs would be stored in Britain under British control. This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. The opposition of several key officials, including the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a>'s <a href="Lewis%20Strauss">Lewis Strauss</a>, and Senators <a href="Bourke%20B.%20Hickenlooper">Bourke B. Hickenlooper</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Vandenberg">Arthur Vandenberg</a>, coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of Fuchs, who was working at Harwell, as a Soviet spy, caused the proposal to be rejected.

By this time, most of the original allocated to Britain had been used up, and the Americans agreed to allocate from the Springfields stockpile. Britain was allocated a further in 1951, and in 1952. Due to increased production, and the discovery and development of new sources of uranium in Portugal, South Africa and Australia, there was sufficient uranium for the United States, British and Canadian programmes, although Britain had to cancel a reactor in 1949.

Between January 1946 and March 1953, ₤44 million was spent on constructing nuclear weapons facilities. Staff were drawn from and recruited into the <a href="Civil%20Service%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Service</a>, and were paid Civil Service salaries.

During the war, Chadwick had arranged for ICI to build a small plant to produce uranium metal. By 1947, it was operational and producing per week. This would be used in BEPO, the experimental reactor built at Harwell, but the plant required <a href="uranium%20oxide">uranium oxide</a> feed, and the export of this from the United States was banned under the McMahon Act. Hinton and his staff at Risley built a new uranium metal plant at Springfields, on the site of a former poison gas plant, at a cost of ₤5.5 million. The first uranium metal was produced in October 1948.

Uranium ore was crushed and dissolved in acids. Impurities were separated and uranium oxide was precipitated. Radium was returned to Union Minière under the contract with the company. The uranium oxide was then purified. It was dissolved in <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> to produce <a href="uranyl%20nitrate">uranyl nitrate</a>. This was then dissolved in <a href="ether">ether</a>, drawn off and precipitated by the addition of ammonia, producing <a href="ammonium%20diuranate">ammonium diuranate</a>. The ammonium diuranate was heated in a furnace and reduced with hydrogen and <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a> to produce <a href="uranium%20tetrafluoride">uranium tetrafluoride</a>. Heating and mixing with calcium metal reduced it to metallic uranium, leaving <a href="calcium%20fluoride">calcium fluoride</a> behind as a <a href="slag">slag</a>. The metallic uranium was then cast into <a href="semi-finished%20casting%20products">billets</a>. These were extruded into rods and sealed in <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> cans.

The first nuclear reactor in the UK, a small 100 kW <a href="research%20reactor">research reactor</a> known as <a href="GLEEP">GLEEP</a>, went <a href="Criticality%20%28status%29">critical</a> at Harwell on 15 August 1947. It was fuelled by of uranium metal and of uranium dioxide, and used of <a href="nuclear%20graphite">nuclear graphite</a> as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>. This was fine for some experimental work, but the production of radioactive isotopes required a more powerful 6,000 kW reactor with a higher <a href="neutron%20flux">neutron flux</a>. British staff at the Montreal Laboratory had designed BEPO in 1945 and 1946; Risley handled the engineering and construction. The key choices in reactor design are the selection of the fuel, the neutron moderator, and the coolant. Since enriched uranium was unavailable, the only available fuel was natural uranium. Similarly, while the Montreal Laboratory had experience with designing and building the <a href="ZEEP">ZEEP</a> <a href="heavy-water%20reactor">heavy-water reactor</a> in Canada, no <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> was available in the UK, so graphite was the only choice for a neutron moderator. That left cooling, and for an experimental reactor, air cooling was the obvious choice. The resulting reactor was thus quite similar to the American <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a>. BEPO, which went critical on 5 July 1948, used of metallic uranium and of graphite, encased in of steel and of concrete.
For the plutonium-producing production reactors, the same reasons mandated the use of natural uranium fuel and graphite as a moderator; but it was originally assumed that they would be water-cooled like the American reactors at the Hanford Site. A water-cooled reactor of the required size would require about of water per day, preferably very pure so as to avoid corroding the metal pipes. Moreover, there were concerns about safety. Water absorbs neutrons, so if there is a sudden loss of cooling water this will result in an increase in the neutron flux and the reactor temperature, and possibly a catastrophic <a href="nuclear%20meltdown">nuclear meltdown</a>. Such an event did indeed occur in the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a> in 1986. The American solution was to locate the facility in a remote location, but in the densely-populated British Isles the only such locations were in the north and west of Scotland. By April 1947, Hinton had convinced Portal of the advantages of a gas-cooled system. Helium was at first the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, So, in the end, air cooling was chosen.

With the need for a remote site obviated, it was decided to build the facility on the coast of <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> at a former Royal Ordnance Factory, <a href="ROF%20Drigg">ROF Drigg</a>. This was soon switched to a more suitable site at the nearby former <a href="ROF%20Sellafield">ROF Sellafield</a>. To avoid any confusion with Springfields, the name was changed to Windscale. Construction began in September 1947. The danger of Wigner's disease was not overlooked. <a href="Walter%20Zinn">Walter Zinn</a> visited Britain in 1948 and provided crucial information. New calculations based on this meant that the layout of the graphite blocks, which were already being machined, had to be changed. The two Windscale reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Due to faulty calculations at the design stage, the reactors did not produce the expected output. As a result, extraordinary measures had to be taken to provide Penney with a first shipment of plutonium in June 1952, and sufficient quantity for a core by the 1 August 1952 deadline. Improvements in the bomb design ultimately meant that he could get by with 15 per cent less plutonium. Starting in 1953, the Windscale reactors were able to use slightly enriched uranium as a fuel. They were shut down after the <a href="Windscale%20fire">Windscale fire</a> in October 1957.

Cartridges of uranium were irradiated in the Windscale reactors to produce plutonium. The cartridges were pushed through the reactor, and exited on the other side, where they fell into submerged steel skips which were pulled into a deep cooling pond. After being irradiated, each cartridge contained as many as 180 <a href="isotopes">isotopes</a> of 35 different <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s. Less than half of one percent of the feed would have been converted to plutonium, but about 5 percent was now radioactive <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a>, the remainder being slightly depleted uranium. After being stored underwater for 150 days, the short-lived isotopes had decayed, leaving significant quantities of about 20 radioactive isotopes. Using <a href="remote%20handling">remote handling</a>, the cartridges were placed in lead-lined "coffins" and transported to the chemical separation plant.

At Hanford, the Americans had used a <a href="bismuth%20phosphate%20process">bismuth phosphate process</a> to separate the plutonium from the uranium. This was wasteful; the plutonium was retrieved, but the uranium was left in a state from which it could not easily be recovered. A team at the Montreal Laboratory investigated this problem, and had devised a new process similar to that used with uranium. They had tried out the process, which they believed could be employed on an industrial scale, to extract 20 mg of plutonium from a spent Hanford fuel rod. The cartridges were dissolved in nitric acid and dibutyl carbitol was used to remove the plutonium.

After 1946, the only source of plutonium was from the <a href="NRX">NRX</a> reactor in Canada, and irradiated rods from there did not arrive in Britain until mid-1948. Nor would Harwell have been able to handle them if they had; a "hot" radioactive laboratory was not built until 1949, although a small hot laboratory was pressed into service in 1948. A pilot plant was established at the <a href="Chalk%20River%20Laboratories">Chalk River Laboratories</a>, which ran until 1950. Despite concerns over whether the process would work, numerous minor changes, and construction problems related to the steel used, the plant was completed on schedule in April 1951. The first active material was fed into the plant on 25 February 1952. The plant performed well for twelve years, exceeding its designed production targets, and was only decommissioned when a larger facility was required. The first plutonium billet was cast on 31 March 1952, but it was impure, and could not be used in a bomb. Further work at Harwell and Windscale was required to perfect the process.

The gaseous diffusion plant was the most complicated of all from an engineering point of view. <a href="Uranium%20hexafluoride">Uranium hexafluoride</a> gas was pumped into a <a href="Cascade%20%28chemical%20engineering%29">cascade</a>, becoming richer in uranium-235 at each stage as it passed through a series of membranes. Procuring the nickel powder used by the Manhattan Project was not a problem, as it came from a British firm. Once again, a Royal Ordnance Factory was chosen as the site, in this case ROF Capenhurst at <a href="Capenhurst">Capenhurst</a>, near <a href="Chester">Chester</a>, which had the advantage of being only from Risley. One decision was that instead of producing uranium hexafluoride using elemental fluorine, which was difficult and hazardous to transport, it was produced at Springfields from <a href="chlorine%20trifluoride">chlorine trifluoride</a>. This process was untried and did not work properly, and when production commenced in February 1952, the hexafluoride plant did not perform adequately. It had to be redesigned at a cost of £250,000. The gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst, which cost £14 million, started production in 1953, but only produced low-enriched uranium, and did not produce <a href="highly%20enriched%20uranium">highly enriched uranium</a> until 1954. By 1957 it was capable of producing 125 kg of highly enriched uranium per annum. British designs at this time used large amounts of enriched uranium; 87 kg for <a href="Green%20Bamboo">Green Bamboo</a>, 117 kg for <a href="Orange%20Herald">Orange Herald</a>. At the end of 1961, having produced between 3.8 and 4.9 tonnes of highly enriched uranium, it was switched over to low-enriched uranium production for civil nuclear power.

Key staff recruited to work at Fort Halstead included <a href="John%20Challens">John Challens</a>, who commenced on 1 January 1948. By mid-1948, it became clear that Penney's initial estimate that he would require 220 staff was wide of the mark, and that he would need nearly 500. This meant not only taking personnel from other projects, but scrapping some entirely. In October 1948, Penney submitted a request for developing a new, separate site for HER on grounds of safety, security and economy. This was approved, but it took another six months to locate a suitable site. An airbase, <a href="RAF%20South%20Cerney">RAF South Cerney</a> in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> was chosen, but the RAF refused to relinquish the site. A former airbase, <a href="RAF%20Aldermaston">RAF Aldermaston</a>, was then selected. At the same time, it was decided to separate HER from the Armaments Research Establishment (ARE). This resulted in a painful bureaucratic battle over personnel like Challens, whose expertise was wanted for research on both nuclear weapons and <a href="guided%20missile">guided missile</a>s. In the end, HER kept 25 of the 30 key personnel that ARE wanted, including Challens. The site was taken over on 1 April 1950. Penney became Chief Superintendent High Explosive Research (CSHER). The first stage of work at Aldermaston was completed in December 1951, but the plutonium processing building was only handed over in April 1952, the month that the first plutonium was due to arrive from Windscale. At the peak of construction in 1953, over 4,000 personnel were working on the site.
The choice of plutonium for the fissile component of the bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an <a href="implosion-type%20nuclear%20weapon">implosion-type nuclear weapon</a>. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with <a href="explosive%20lens">explosive lens</a>es. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew to that of the American <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a> as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of <a href="RDX">RDX</a>, an ARD product, for <a href="Composition%20B">Composition B</a> as the fast explosive component of the lenses; <a href="Baratol">Baratol</a> would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">Operation Hurricane</a> assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the <a href="neutron%20reflector">tamper</a>. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at <a href="Foulness">Foulness</a> by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the <a href="exploding-bridgewire%20detonator">exploding-bridgewire detonator</a>; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.

Work on the plutonium core had to wait until Windscale delivered sufficient product, which was not until late 1951. The uranium tamper proved more of a challenge for the metallurgists than anticipated, due to a shortage of machine tools and moulds, and difficulty with the <a href="vacuum%20furnace">vacuum furnace</a>. The first spheres were cast in December 1951, and while they were spherical to within , there were some casting defects, and it was feared they would hinder the implosion process. The defects were repaired, and two castings were prepared for Operation Hurricane. Work on plutonium chemistry and metallurgy was carried out at Harwell, as the hot laboratory at Aldermaston was not completed until May 1952. The first plutonium billet was cast there from plutonium nitrate from the Chalk River Laboratories in 1951. The metallurgists chose to alloy the plutonium with <a href="gallium">gallium</a> to stabilise it in the malleable δ phase <a href="allotropes%20of%20plutonium">allotrope</a>. Not until the first billet arrived from Harwell in 1951 were they able to confirm that this was practical. The first plutonium at Aldermaston was cast in an <a href="argon">argon</a> atmosphere in a cerium sulphide crucible.

The other radioactive element in use was <a href="polonium">polonium</a>, which was used in the <a href="modulated%20neutron%20initiator">initiator</a>. It was one of the parts of the Manhattan Project that the British mission had not been involved in, and little was known about its chemistry and properties, except that it had a <a href="half%20life">half life</a> of 138 days. A disturbing discovery was that motes of polonium could propel themselves through the air using their own <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a> emissions. Safety procedures had to be tightened. It was produced at Windscale by irradiation of <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>. A special plant was built there to extract it, but it was not operational until June 1952. The final product was just of polonium, less than 1 mg. It was only just available on time for Operation Hurricane.

A small RAF team that eventually numbered ten men was assigned to liaise with HER, under the command of <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> <a href="John%20Rowlands%20%28RAF%20officer%29">John Rowlands</a>. He was answerable to a committee at the Air Ministry, codenamed "Herod". They considered how atomic bombing missions would be flown, and prepared training courses and manuals on how the production weapon, codenamed <a href="Blue%20Danube%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Blue Danube</a>, would be stored, handled and maintained. The ballistic casing of the bomb was designed at <a href="Farnborough%2C%20Hampshire">Farnborough</a>. Rowlands was responsible for an important design change. For safety reasons, he wanted the core inserted like a plug while the bomber was in flight. Fuchs performed calculations of the nuclear physics involved at Harwell in 1948, and produced an alternative design that, while untried, could be used. The new British design incorporated a <a href="levitated%20pit">levitated pit</a>, in which there was an air gap between the uranium tamper and the plutonium core. This gave the explosion time to build up momentum, similar in principle to a hammer hitting a nail.

Implicit in the decision to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them. The preferred site was the American <a href="Pacific%20Proving%20Grounds">Pacific Proving Grounds</a>. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. In September 1950, the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> suggested that the <a href="Monte%20Bello%20Islands">Monte Bello Islands</a> in Australia might be suitable, so Attlee sent a request to the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, for permission to send a survey party to have a look at the islands. Menzies agreed, and in November 1950, a three-man party headed by <a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> E. D. Davis was sent out to the islands. The Australian government formally agreed to the islands being used in May 1951, and in December 1951 the new British government under Winston Churchill confirmed the choice of test site. On 26 February 1952 Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia before the end of the year.

A small fleet was assembled for Operation Hurricane that included the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> , which served as the flagship, and the <a href="Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank">LSTs</a> "Narvik", "Zeebrugge" and "Tracker", under the command of <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Rear Admiral</a> A. D. Torlesse. Leonard Tyte from Aldermaston was appointed the technical director. The bomb assemblies for Operation Hurricane were assembled at Foulness, and then taken to the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> on 5 June 1952 for transport to Australia. It took "Campania" and "Plym" eight weeks to make the voyage, as they sailed around the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> to avoid traversing the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>, as there was <a href="Egyptian%20revolution%20of%201952">unrest in Egypt</a> at the time. The Montebello Islands were reached on 8 August. They were joined by eleven <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> ships, including the aircraft carrier . The plutonium core went by air, flying from <a href="RAF%20Lyneham">RAF Lyneham</a> to Singapore in <a href="Handley%20Page%20Hastings">Handley Page Hastings</a> aircraft via Cyprus, <a href="Sharjah">Sharjah</a> and Ceylon. From Singapore they made the final leg of their journey in a <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> flying boat. Penney arrived by air on 22 September.

The bomb was successfully detonated on board "Plym" at 09:29:24 on 3 October 1952 local time (23:59:24 on 2 October 1952 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>). The explosion occurred below the water line, and left a saucer-shaped crater on the seabed deep and across. The yield was estimated at .

A July 1945 Tizard Committee report foresaw the advent of long-range rockets and pilotless aircraft, but did not envision them as likely within ten years, and therefore urged the development of long-range jet <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s. In 1946, the RAF's front line bomber was the <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a>, a development of the wartime <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a>. It did not have the range to reach targets in the Soviet Union, nor could it deal with jet fighter interceptors. <a href="Operational%20Requirement">Operational Requirement</a> (OR229) called for a high-altitude jet bomber with a range of carrying an atomic bomb. The 9 August 1946 requirement for an atomic bomb (OR1001) specified that it be not more than in length or in diameter, and weigh no more than .
OR229 was approved by the Operational Requirements Committee on 17 December 1946, and the Ministry of Supply sent out letters inviting tenders on 8 January 1947. Three bombers resulted from OR229: the <a href="Vickers%20Valiant">Vickers Valiant</a>, <a href="Avro%20Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> and <a href="Handley%20Page%20Victor">Handley Page Victor</a>, known as the <a href="V%20bomber">V bomber</a>s. The high priority accorded to the atomic bomb programme was not shared by the V bomber programme. Vickers was given the first production order for 25 Valiants on 9 February 1951, and they were delivered on 8 February 1955. The Vulcan and Victor followed, entering service in 1956 and 1957 respectively. Thus, when the first Blue Danube atomic bombs were delivered to the <a href="Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> Armaments School at <a href="RAF%20Wittering">RAF Wittering</a> on 7 and 11 November 1953, the RAF had no bombers capable of carrying them. Penney noted that "the RAF has handled aircraft for a long time and can fly Valiants as soon as they come off the production line. But the Royal Air Force has not yet handled atomic weapons, therefore, we must get some bombs to the RAF at the earliest possible moment, so that the handling and servicing can be practiced and fully worked out." For the time being, the United Kingdom remained dependent on the American <a href="nuclear%20umbrella">nuclear umbrella</a>.

On 5 November 1953, the Air and Naval Staffs therefore issued an Operational Requirement (OR1127) for a smaller, lighter atomic bomb capable of being carried by their <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a>, <a href="Gloster%20Javelin">Gloster Javelin</a> and <a href="Supermarine%20Scimitar">Supermarine Scimitar</a> aircraft. Aldermaston commenced work on the new bomb, codenamed <a href="Red%20Beard%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Red Beard</a>, in 1954. It had a composite uranium-plutonium core, and used air lenses to reduce its dimensions while still having a yield of 10 kilotons. Indeed, later <a href="Boosted%20fission%20weapon">boosted</a> versions had yields of up to 100 kilotons. Red Beard weighed , about a fifth of Blue Danube, was long and in diameter. It was tested in the Operation Buffalo <a href="British%20nuclear%20tests%20at%20Maralinga">British nuclear tests at Maralinga</a> in September and October 1956, but various problems encountered meant that deliveries of production versions to the RAF and Royal Navy did not occur until 1960.

In 1951, Penney wrote that "the discriminative test for a first-class power is whether it has made an atomic bomb and we have either got to pass the test or suffer a serious loss of prestige both inside this country and internationally." There was fear of being left behind, and hope that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to resume the Special Relationship. The successful test of an atomic bomb represented an extraordinary technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power.

High Explosive Research achieved its objective with remarkable economy and efficiency, but the price was still high. Between 1946 and 1953, Risley spent £72 million, Harwell almost £27 million and the weapons establishment over £9.5 million. By comparison, British defence expenditure in 1948 was £600 million. HER accounted for 11 per cent of the Ministry of Supply's expenditure between 1946 and 1953. It had bi-partisan and popular support. Given Britain's dire financial position, thought turned to replacing conventional forces with atomic bombs. While certainly expensive, they could deliver extraordinary destructive power at relatively low cost. The concept of <a href="Deterrence%20theory">deterrence</a> began to evolve, based on experiences dating back to the <a href="Great%20War">Great War</a>. There were also technological spin-offs. The possession of nuclear reactors, the means to produce nuclear fuels and a repository of scientific knowledge led to the creation of a vast <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> industry.

Yet all the while Britain strove for independence, at the same time it sought interdependence in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. This was desired more than ever, as other countries recovered from the war and once again began to challenge Britain's status. As successful as it was, High Explosive Research fell short on both counts. The technology demonstrated at Monte Bello in October 1952 was already seven years old. The following month the United States tested <a href="Ivy%20Mike">Ivy Mike</a>, a <a href="thermonuclear%20weapon">thermonuclear device</a>. The British government would now have to decide whether to initiate its own <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a> programme. Penney, for one, feared that this would likely prove to be beyond the financial resources of Britain's war-ravaged economy. The successful <a href="British%20hydrogen%20bomb%20programme">British hydrogen bomb programme</a>, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>, led to amendment of the United States Atomic Energy Act in 1958, and a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the <a href="1958%20US%E2%80%93UK%20Mutual%20Defence%20Agreement">1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement</a>.

Kalākaua's 1881 world tour

The 1881 world tour of King <a href="Kal%C4%81kaua">Kalākaua</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a> was his attempt to save the <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20Native%20Hawaiians">Hawaiian culture</a> and population from extinction by importing a labor force from <a href="Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> nations. His efforts brought the small island nation to the attention of world leaders, but sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. Critics in Hawaii believed the labor negotiations were just an excuse to see the world. The 281-day trip gave Kalākaua the distinction of being the first monarch to <a href="circumnavigation">circumnavigate</a> the globe; his 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of a <a href="State%20dinner%23United%20States">state dinner</a> at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>.

Kalākaua met with heads of state in Asia, the Mideast and Europe, to encourage an influx of <a href="Sugar%20plantations%20in%20Hawaii">sugar plantation</a> labor in family groups, as well as unmarried women as potential brides for Hawaii's existing contract laborers. While in Asia, he tried to forestall American ambitions by offering a plan to <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a> for putting Hawaii under the protection of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> with an arranged marriage between his niece <a href="Ka%CA%BBiulani">Kaʻiulani</a> and a Japanese prince. On his visit to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a>, he negotiated a treaty of friendship and commerce with Hawaii that would provide a legal framework for the emigration of Portuguese laborers to Hawaii. The King had an audience in Rome with <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> and met with many of the crowned heads of Europe. Britain's <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and the splendor of her royal life impressed him more than any other monarchy; having been greatly affected by the ornate trappings of European sovereigns, he would soon have Hawaii's monarchy mirror that grandeur.

The King traveled with no security guards; only a small group of personal friends made the journey with him. Except for land transportation in cities, and two loaned ships in China and the US, his modes of transportation were seldom reserved exclusively for him. He shared regularly scheduled steamships and rail transport with fare-paying passengers. On the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, he played cards and danced with other passengers. Like other tourists, he visited the <a href="White%20elephant%20%28animal%29%23Thailand">white elephants of Siam</a>, the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Giza pyramid complex</a> in Egypt, tourist sites in India, and museums in Europe. Along the way, he exceeded his original budget, shopping regardless, and sent letters back home.

President <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> died four days before they arrived back in the United States, and Kalākaua paid a courtesy call to newly inaugurated President <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> at the White House in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> There were no public or private appearances for the King in New York, only a day at <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a>. Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a> to see a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a>. He toured <a href="Hampton%20University">Hampton Normal and Agricultural School</a>, and shopped for <a href="Equine%20industry%20in%20Kentucky">horses in Kentucky</a>. The royal party boarded a train to <a href="California">California</a>, where they were house guests of <a href="Claus%20Spreckels">Claus Spreckels</a> at his estate in <a href="Aptos%2C%20California">Aptos</a> (near Santa Cruz), and spent a few days seeing the sights before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in jump-starting new immigration, the first transplants arriving in Hawaii less than a year later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty with expensive furnishings in <a href="Iolani%20Palace">Iolani Palace</a>, a public coronation for himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.

No other sovereign ruler had ever accomplished the feat of circling the globe, but Kalākaua, the last king of the Hawaiian Islands, had previously set other records. He was the first reigning monarch to visit America during his 1874 visit to Washington, D.C. for negotiations on the <a href="Reciprocity%20Treaty%20of%201875">Reciprocity Treaty of 1875</a>. The <a href="State%20dinner%23United%20States">state dinner</a> in his honor hosted by President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> was the first <a href="White%20House">White House</a> state dinner ever given. According to the personal writings of <a href="Queen%20Emma%20of%20Hawaii">Queen Dowager Emma</a>, a political opponent of his, Kalākaua supposedly had the intention in 1874 of making a world tour "for his personal gratification and vanity".

The islands were officially the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a> but had generally been known as the Sandwich Islands since the 1778 visit of Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>. The estimated population of <a href="Native%20Hawaiians">Native Hawaiians</a> when Cook arrived was 800,000. With the <a href="Whaling%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Expansion">arrival of whaling ships</a> and missionaries in the early 19th century, the Native Hawaiians were exposed to diseases for which they had no immunity and began dying in large numbers. The official 1878 census showed only 44,088 individuals who claimed Hawaiian ethnicity. The sugar plantation work force in the islands and the dwindling population of the Hawaiian race had been Kalākaua's ongoing concerns. On December 24, 1880, he signed an act of the <a href="Legislature%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">legislative assembly</a> acknowledging corruption in the immigration system and authorizing Minister of the Interior <a href="Henry%20A.%20P.%20Carter">Henry A. P. Carter</a> to take charge of licensing immigration brokers.

Immediately following the signing of the legislation, he visited each major island in the kingdom for a personal look at how the reciprocity treaty had affected his people. In a speech before an audience of Native Hawaiians at a Congregational church on Kauai, Kalākaua related his concerns, "I will speak to you of one of our great questions, which is the supply of people, not only to meet the requirements of all our industries but to assist in the increase of a Hawaiian population." He wanted to bring in immigrants from <a href="Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> nations, as well as Europe and the United States, to save the declining population of the Hawaiian race from completely dying out. Prior labor immigration had been mostly unmarried men, and he hoped to attract unmarried women as potential wives for them, as well as bringing in family groups.
Kalākaua appointed <a href="William%20Nevins%20Armstrong">William Nevins Armstrong</a> as Attorney General in December. Armstrong had been born to Presbyterian missionaries Clarissa and <a href="Richard%20Armstrong%20%28Hawaii%29">Richard Armstrong</a> in <a href="Lahaina%2C%20Hawaii">Lahaina</a>. He had known Kalākaua since their early days at the <a href="Chiefs%20Children%27s%20School">Chiefs Children's School</a> on Maui where he and classmate <a href="Charles%20Hastings%20Judd">Charles Hastings Judd</a> became friends with the future king. He graduated from <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> and became a successful lawyer before returning to Hawaii. Judd had been on Kalākaua's staff since he was elected king, soon after becoming part of his Privy Council, as well as being his chamberlain and private secretary.

Years later Armstrong remembered the invitation to join the tour as having arisen in a casual conversation, during which he did not believe the King was serious. He realized the proposed tour was not just idle conversation when the King informed his Cabinet of his plans and chose Armstrong, Judd, and his personal cook Robert von Oelhoffen as his only traveling companions. At a state dinner held by Kalākaua and his ministers a week before departure, Armstrong spoke of their youthful dreams of sailing around the world finally being brought to fruition.

Minister of the Interior Carter issued a Bureau of Immigration Ordinance on January 14, 1881, stipulating the terms and conditions under which new immigrants would be allowed into the islands. On January 17, Kalākaua appointed Armstrong as Royal Commissioner of Immigration; Carter became acting Attorney General until their return. Armstrong had instructions to return with a feasibility study indicating which nations were likely to provide "a desirable population" for the Hawaiian labor force. <a href="William%20Lowthian%20Green">William L. Green</a>, <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Hawaii%29">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>, followed up with a <a href="communique">communique</a> to Hawaii's consulates stating the goals for the tour.

Kalākaua's sister and heir-apparent <a href="Lili%CA%BBuokalani">Liliʻuokalani</a> was to act as Regent during his absence. She devoted a chapter of her 1898 book "Hawaii's Story" to her brother's tour. Her assertion was that the "<a href="Reform%20Party%20of%20Hawaii">missionary party</a>" tried to exert its control by insisting that she only be allowed to be in charge of a temporary council and that all decisions in the King's absence were to be made by the entire council. She balked at the suggestion and demanded that her regency have full royal power; he agreed.

Farewell receptions were held for the King by the Catholic and Protestant communities in Honolulu on the eve of his departure. <a href="John%20M%C4%81kini%20Kapena">John Mākini Kapena</a>, a member of the <a href="Legislature%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii%23House%20of%20Nobles">House of Nobles</a>, spoke to the assembled well-wishers gathered at <a href="Kawaiaha%CA%BBo%20Church">Kawaiahaʻo Church</a>, stating "… The great nations now look with respect on this little Kingdom and will have still more, when they see our King traveling among them for information to benefit his people, Let us all pray every day for the King's health, and safe return to his people." Throughout the night, his subjects serenaded him with traditional "oli" (chants) and "mele" (songs) outside the palace.

Kalākaua's <a href="Freemasonry">Masonic</a> ties as Master of <a href="Lodge%20Le%20Progres%20de%20L%27Oceanie">Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie</a> would give him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the steamship "City of Sydney" at 6:30 a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached out to touch him. Major <a href="George%20W.%20Macfarlane">George W. Macfarlane</a>, his <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as <a href="Ali%CA%BBi">Aliʻi</a> Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly <a href="retinue">retinue</a> required for official business. The <a href="Royal%20Hawaiian%20Band">Royal Hawaiian Band</a>, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the "City of Sydney" sailed out.

The "City of Sydney" arrived at <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> during a rain storm a week later, and Kalākaua's party ensconced themselves in the <a href="Palace%20Hotel%2C%20San%20Francisco">Palace Hotel</a>. Spectators amassed at the train station for their arrival in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento</a> that week, during which the royal group visited the <a href="California%20State%20Legislature">California State Legislature</a>. They were accompanied in California's capital by Governor <a href="George%20Clement%20Perkins">George Clement Perkins</a>, sugar baron <a href="Claus%20Spreckels">Claus Spreckels</a>, and water engineer <a href="Hermann%20Schussler">Hermann Schussler</a>, who had worked on several projects in Hawaii.

During the week, the King and Judd were made honorary members of the Pacific Yacht Club in <a href="Sausalito%2C%20California">Sausalito</a> at a reception hosted by Commodore R. S. Floyd. Kalākaua was also feted at a gala in <a href="Chinatown%2C%20San%20Francisco">San Francisco's Chinatown</a>, given by the Chinese Consul-General and attended by leaders of the local Chinese community. It was Armstrong who delivered the after-dinner speech and offered a toast to continued good relations with the Chinese population in Hawaii.

In response to Kalākaua's expressed fondness for music and the company of women, "The Ladies of the Palace Hotel" threw a formal-attire grand ball in his honor. A news commentary on the California visit stated, "…  it may be said that every hour of King Kalākaua's stay in San Francisco has been filled up with a grand ovation of activities."

The party sailed on the "Oceanic" out of San Francisco on February 8. Reaching the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> on March 4, they were surprised by elaborate welcoming ceremonies that included the playing of the anthem Kalākaua had written, "<a href="Hawai%CA%BBi%20Pono%CA%BB%C4%AB">Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī</a>". They had not given advance notice to the Japanese government of their pending visit, but the government had been alerted by a telegraph from the Imperial General Consul in San Francisco. Believing a formal reception was required by their 1871 treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii, they welcomed the King as a friendly head of state. In deference, Kalākaua acquiesced to his being treated as if he were on an official state visit.

The King and his small group spent just under three weeks on their tour of Japan. They were formally welcomed at the <a href="Tokyo%20Imperial%20Palace">Tokyo Imperial Palace</a> and taken to <a href="Morita-za">Shintomiza, the Imperial Theatre</a>, to be entertained by a <a href="kabuki">kabuki</a> drama. The following day <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a> held a state dinner for his visitors. The Emperor presented the King with two suits of <a href="Japanese%20armour">Japanese armor</a>, and bestowed upon him the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Chrysanthemum">Order of the Chrysanthemum</a> with Badge, and the Star of the Order. The King reciprocated with a royal painting of <a href="Queen%20Kapiolani">Queen Kapiolani</a> and himself, and presented the Emperor with the <a href="Royal%20Order%20of%20Kamehameha%20I%20%28decoration%29">Grand Cross of Kamehameha</a>. In the same ceremony, Judd and Armstrong were given the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun">Order of the Rising Sun</a>. By way of understanding local education and industries, the King toured the College of the Imperial Guard, Imperial Engineering College, and the <a href="Oji%20Paper%20Company">Oji Paper Company</a>. Two of Japan's generals gave him a guided tour through the empire's arsenal.

Concern over a possible United States seizure of the Hawaiian Islands motivated Kalākaua to hold a secret meeting with the Emperor to bring Hawaii under the protective aegis of the Japanese empire. He proposed to unite the two nations with an arranged marriage between his 5-year-old niece <a href="Ka%CA%BBiulani">Kaʻiulani</a> and 13-year-old <a href="Prince%20Higashifushimi%20Yorihito">Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito</a>. Historian <a href="Ralph%20Simpson%20Kuykendall">Ralph Kuykendall</a> said the proposal was rejected both by Yorihito, upon advice of his father, and by the government of Japan. The Hawaiian king also recommended that Emperor Meiji create a "Union and Federation of the Asiatic nations and sovereigns" with Japan as its head, although the Emperor politely declined this idea at a later date.

Japanese newspapers cautioned about looking for an emigrating labor force in Japan, stating that their own country had large areas of available agricultural land that went untouched. A ball was planned in the king's honor by the Masonic Fraternity of Yokohama, which he bowed out of when he learned of the assassination of <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>. The Kalākaua group arrived in <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a> on March 18 for a sightseeing tour and lunch with the mayor. On March 22, they embarked on the steamship "Tokio Maru" bound for Shanghai.
The Chinese had been a part of Hawaii's culture since the late 18th century, when the islands were first visited by Chinese merchants and tradesmen. In 1852, sugar plantations began recruiting unskilled labor from China. Because these men initially intended to return to China upon the completion of their contracts, most came without families.

Upon arriving in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> on March 25, Kalākaua spent two days in residence at the <a href="Astor%20House%20Hotel%20%28Shanghai%29">Astor House Hotel</a>, receiving foreign diplomats. They departed for <a href="Tianjin">Tientsin</a> on March 27 when <a href="Viceroy%20of%20Zhili">Viceroy</a> <a href="Li%20Hongzhang">Li Hung Chang</a> offered the steamship "Pautah" for their use.

Kalākaua met with the Viceroy on March 31 to propose the emigration of unmarried Chinese women, as well as Chinese family units to Hawaii, to counterbalance the labor population of unmarried Chinese men. The Viceroy responded favorably and agreed to co-sponsor such an emigration with the Hawaiian government. Li arranged several events to provide Kalākaua the opportunity to meet the city's influential persons. A copy of a draft of a proposed treaty was forwarded to Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs Green. The "Hong Kong Daily News" held a positive view of Hawaii's treatment of existing Chinese laborers, but stated that the Chinese government needed to provide financial assistance for family emigration to Hawaii. The royal party returned to Shanghai on April 6. A proposed trip to <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> was aborted when <a href="Empress%20Dowager%20Ci%27an">Empress Dowager Ci'an</a> died on April 8. They sailed out of China the next day.

The traveling group departed on the steamship "Thibet" for <a href="British%20Hong%20Kong">British Hong Kong</a>, arriving April 12. Kalākaua was the guest of Hong Kong's governor <a href="John%20Pope%20Hennessy">John Pope Hennessy</a> at <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Government House</a>, where the king was honored with a diplomatic reception and banquet. Armstrong delivered the after-dinner speech.

Kalākaua was given celebratory receptions at the Victoria Lodge of Freemasons No. 1026 and Perseverance Lodge No. 1165, both in Hong Kong. Judd was voted into the masonry brotherhood at the latter, Lodge No. 1165.

They left Hong Kong on the steamship "Killarney" on April 21.

The steamship "Killarney" arrived in <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> on April 26. How they would be received was speculative, since Hawaii had no treaty with Siam. Upon arrival, they were carried aboard a royal yacht up the <a href="Chao%20Phraya%20River">Menam River</a> to Bangkok. From there, they were carried on silk chairs to one of the many <a href="List%20of%20palaces%20in%20Bangkok">palaces in Bangkok</a> for the duration of their visit. The following day they met with King <a href="Chulalongkorn">Chulalongkorn</a> who told Kalākaua that the Siamese and Native Hawaiians were related by the common Malayan bloodline. A member of the Siamese royal family escorted Kalākaua to see the nation's famed <a href="white%20elephant%20%28animal%29">white elephants</a>.

Chulalongkorn hosted a state dinner and made Kalākaua a Knight of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20of%20Thailand">Grand Cross of the Crown of Siam</a>; Kalākaua reciprocated with the Royal Order of Kamehameha I. Armstrong and Judd were given the Knight Grand Cross of the Crown of Siam, Third Class. No labor negotiations took place, although Kalākaua later mentioned in his letter to his brother-in-law Oahu Governor <a href="John%20Owen%20Dominis">John Owen Dominis</a> that "an exchange of decorations" with leaders in Asian nations potentially opened doors for future talks on immigration. He included a lengthy list of decorations to be sent to various members of the Siamese nobility.

Kalākaua's party embarked on the steamship "Bangkok" for Singapore on May 1. As the ship sailed away, they were bid farewell by a military gun salute, and shouts of approval by well-wishers at the dock.

By the time the "Bangkok" docked in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> on May 6, Kalākaua had had enough of formal events, turning down the offer of accommodations at <a href="Istana%20%28Singapore%29">Government House</a> in favor of the simplicity of a hotel. Nevertheless, Governor <a href="Frederick%20Weld">Frederick Weld</a> held a formal reception and state dinner for him.

When he visited Sultan <a href="Abu%20Bakar%20of%20Johor">Abu Bakar of Johor</a> on May 10 at the <a href="Istana%20Besar">Palace of Istana Besar</a>, 40 miles from Singapore, he was greeted as a brother. They squared off in the Sultan's palace over a <a href="billiard%20table">billiard table</a>. Armstrong was advised by Abu Bakar that while the inhabitants of Singapore and the Malay peninsula were good at varied professions, agricultural labor was not one of them. Abu Bakar told Armstrong that the Malay states were importing plantation labor from China and India.

Kalākaua and Judd visited the Lodge Zetland in the East, No. 548, in Singapore on May 11, where Judd was bestowed with the third degree in masonry. The king had hoped to buy pearls for his wife Queen Kapiolani in Singapore, but found the prices prohibitive. On May 12, the royal entourage departed on the steamship "Mecca".

<a href="Malacca">Malacca</a> was a six-hour layover on May 13, affording limited sightseeing. Kalākaua was given walking canes as souvenirs. Their one day at <a href="Penang">Penang</a> on May 15 saw a visit by Governor <a href="John%20Frederick%20Adolphus%20McNair">John Frederick Adolphus McNair</a> who hosted them at his residence of <a href="Suffolk%20House%2C%20Penang">Suffolk House</a>.

A change of transportation at <a href="Mawlamyine">Moulmein</a> put them on the steamship "Pembo" (or "Pamba"), arriving in <a href="Yangon">Rangoon</a> on May 22. During their stopover, they were entertained at Government House by the English Commissioner, and Kalākaua attended worship services at the chapel of St. John's College. They departed on May 24.

Several plantation owners in Hawaii favored the importation of <a href="coolie">coolie</a> labor from the <a href="East%20India">East India</a> region. Henry A. P. Carter and British consul <a href="James%20Hay%20Wodehouse">James Hay Wodehouse</a> had already visited England in 1879 to open a door for the process. They were discouraged by stipulations that Hawaii would be forced to pass legislation that would in essence be a detailed labor contract. There was a further requirement that such a Hawaiian law could not be changed without the approval of the governments of both Great Britain and East India. The prospect was explored through the end of 1880, when Hawaii's immigration board decided the islands could not import Indian labor within the parameters required.

According to a report of the trip Armstrong later filed with the Hawaiian government, any negotiations for Indian contract labor had to be done with the British government in London, so no talks were conducted during their time in India. They arrived in <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> on May 28 and visited the <a href="Alipore%20Zoological%20Gardens">Alipore Zoological Gardens</a>. Kalākaua spent one day sitting in the Calcutta courthouse to observe India's legal process. Their trip across the <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a> subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, and they stopped to tour the <a href="Ellora%20Caves">Ellora Caves</a> prior to reaching <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a>. The King soon tired of the long journey, and was bored and restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay to interest him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the <a href="Parsi">Parsi</a> <a href="Tower%20of%20Silence">Towers of Silence</a>, and a visit from businessman <a href="Sir%20Jamsetjee%20Jejeebhoy%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy</a>.

The steamship "Rosetta" sailed out of Bombay on June 7, carrying Kalākaua and his friends to <a href="Aden">Aden</a> for an afternoon of shopping on June 14, and then onto the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. In a letter to Liliʻuokalani, Kalākaua described how his romantic boyhood dreams of sailing the Red Sea were dashed by the tedium of a week on the water with no land in sight. All was not lost, since he and the estimated 70 other passengers passed the week playing games and dancing.

Arriving at the <a href="Suez">Suez</a> on June 20, they boarded a train for <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. With no existing treaty with Egypt, they were pleasantly surprised by <a href="Khedive">Khedive</a> <a href="Tewfik%20Pasha">Tewfik Pasha</a>'s offer of his Cairo palace during their stay, accommodating them with a tour of the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Pyramid complex</a> and the <a href="Great%20Sphinx%20of%20Giza">Great Sphinx</a> on the <a href="Giza%20Plateau">Giza Plateau</a>.

Writing to his sister Liliʻuokalani from Cairo, he responded to her letter apprising him of the <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> epidemic in the islands: "… what is the use of praying after 293 lives of our poor people have gone to their everlasting place. Is it to thank him for killing or is it to thank him for sending them to him or to the other place … To save the life of the people is to work and not pray."

The "Egyptian Gazette" published Kalākaua's acceptance speech when the Grand Lodge of Egypt freemasons made him Honorary Grand Master of the Great Orient of Egypt. He was honored with a state ball in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> by the Khedive on June 24, the day before they left on the steamer "Asia".

Throughout their European stops, Armstrong saw a willingness among some who were looking for a life change to consider emigrating to Hawaii as plantation labor. Generally, however, they were looking for a stake in land ownership that the kingdom was not willing to offer.

Armstrong mentioned a brief stop at <a href="Catania">Catania</a>, on the island of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, probably on June 29, visiting the <a href="Catania%20Cathedral">Catania Cathedral</a> and <a href="Mount%20Etna">Mount Etna</a>. Their next stop was at <a href="Naples">Naples</a> on June 30, where they were greeted by the Prefect of Naples, the Commanding General and Admiral of Naples, and <a href="Celso%20Caesar%20Moreno">Celso Caesar Moreno</a>, presenting himself to local officials as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hawaii. Moreno was a friend of Kalākaua's who many felt was a <a href="confidence%20scam">con artist</a>. Armstrong described him as someone who scammed his way into Kalākaua's good graces in Hawaii. Moreno had been appointed Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1880. He created a divisive situation that put the King at odds with his own cabinet, leading to Moreno's dismissal five days later. He and Kalākaua remained on cordial terms. Moreno had been appointed the guardian of three Hawaiian students, including the future rebel leaders <a href="Robert%20Napu%CA%BBuako%20Boyd">Robert Napuʻuako Boyd</a> and <a href="Robert%20William%20Wilcox">Robert William Wilcox</a>, who were being educated in Italy as a part of the government funded study-abroad program. Moreno was relieved of that responsibility once the King was made aware that Moreno had misrepresented them as Kalākaua's natural sons, and that he had misled the Italian government into believing he had an official position with the Hawaiian government. The "Saturday Press" in Honolulu was indignant at his association with Kalākaua and their re-connection in Italy, stating that Moreno "… had fought to the last ditch, and has, we hope, tumbled into it and will remain there."

The royal group spent two hours at <a href="Naples%20National%20Archaeological%20Museum">Naples National Archaeological Museum</a> before having an audience with King <a href="Umberto%20I%20of%20Italy">Umberto I</a> and Queen <a href="Margherita%20of%20Savoy">Margherita</a>. They spent the next day seeing more attractions in Naples, before heading for Rome on the afternoon train. Prior to their departure, they had learned of the July 2 shooting of President <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> in Washington, D.C.

Their time in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> was a brief two days, during which Kalākaua, Armstrong, and Judd were granted an audience with <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> on July 3. After receiving his blessing, they toured <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a> and other local tourist sites, and left the following day by train. The party traveled across France and Paris without informing the French authorities, which was seen as a breach of official protocol and had to be explained at a later date.

The Kalākaua group arrived in <a href="London">London</a> the evening of July 6. The King spent the next day receiving visitors in his suite at <a href="Claridge%27s">Claridge's</a>, later accepting <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s offer of the royal box at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a>, <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>. While in England, he attended an <a href="Eton%20v%20Harrow">Eton v Harrow</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a> match, and returned to the Royal Opera House to hear opera singer <a href="Adelina%20Patti">Adelina Patti</a>. The Queen's annual <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Windsor Great Park</a> review of 50,000 military volunteers drew many high-ranking and titled spectators, including Kalākaua. Following the review, he was entertained by <a href="Civil%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">Civil Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Thomas%20Brassey%2C%201st%20Earl%20Brassey">Thomas Brassey</a> and his wife at their encampment. He attended worship services at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on Sunday, prior to his afternoon sailing trip with <a href="Lord%20Charles%20Beresford">Lord Charles Beresford</a> and guests.

Kalākaua, Armstrong and Judd were formally presented to Queen Victoria at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. Kalākaua's letter to his sister Liliʻuokalani expressed his excitement about meeting the Queen, "… I was quite electrified and monopolized the whole conversation that took place during the interview." His letter was effusive in details about the titled royals and aristocrats they had met, including the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince</a> and <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Princess of Wales</a>, and the <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">Crown Prince</a> and <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Crown Princess of Prussia</a>. The Prince of Wales paid many attentions to Kalākaua, hoping to sway him away from the United States. He insisted on giving Kalākaua precedence ahead of his brother-in-law, the <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">Crown Prince of Germany</a> and responded to German objections by saying, "Either the brute is a king or else he is an ordinary black nigger, and if he is not a king, why is he here?" At this point in their trip, Armstrong temporarily returned to his family in the United States.

Hawaii's relationship with A. Hoffnung & Company in London dated back to 1877 when Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs Henry A. P. Carter recommended the firm to handle Portuguese emigration to the island kingdom. The firm's founder Abraham Hoffnung was attached to the Hawaiian Board of Immigration in London, and had already succeeded in sending Hawaii 751 Portuguese citizens (237 men, 191 women, and 323 children) in 1879. Kalākaua reconnected with Hoffnung over dinner, and he became part of the royal party as it traveled through Europe.

On July 23, the day before departing for Brussels, Kalākaua had lunch with the <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teck">Duke of Teck</a>, and inspected ships at the <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow Shipbuilders</a>.

Kalākaua and Judd left England on July 24, arriving in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> the next morning. They spent a few days sightseeing, and visited <a href="Waterloo%2C%20Belgium">Waterloo</a>, where <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> had been <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">defeated in 1815</a>. Kalākaua presented Belgium's <a href="Leopold%20II%20of%20Belgium">King Leopold II</a> with the Order of Kamehameha when he paid a visit to him.

They arrived at <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> on July 29, visiting the <a href="Cologne%20Cathedral">Cologne Cathedral</a> before continuing on to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. Kalākaua stayed in his Berlin accommodations and took care of his correspondence the first full day of his stay, with German soldiers standing vigil outside his door. He received boisterous expressions of public approval wherever he appeared. During their stay, they attended several military displays and toured museums, castles, and other sites of interest. The King was entertained by the future <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> and his wife, who were receiving him on behalf of Wilhelm's grandfather, the <a href="William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">German Emperor</a>. On a visit to <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a> with <a href="Prince%20Charles%20of%20Prussia">Prince Charles of Prussia</a>, Kalākaua was awarded the Grand Cross of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Red%20Eagle">Order of the Red Eagle</a>. Armstrong rejoined the group in Germany, but was too ill to accompany them on their outings. They departed for <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> on August 4.

Onlookers gathered at Vienna's in anticipation of Kalākaua's arrival. When he stepped off the train to be escorted by Austrian officials to the <a href="Hotel%20Imperial">Hotel Imperial</a>, cheering rang out from the crowd. He later visited the Imperial Arsenal. After a tour of the <a href="Belvedere%2C%20Vienna">Belvedere</a>, he attended a concert conducted by <a href="Eduard%20Strauss">Eduard Strauss</a> at the <a href="Volksgarten%2C%20Vienna">Volksgarten</a>. In the evening he enjoyed a ballet at the <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Imperial Opera House</a>.

The royal family had already left Vienna for the summer, but Kalākaua got to inspect the troops during military maneuvers at the <a href="Schmelz%20%28Vienna%29">Schmelz</a> parade grounds. He later had an audience with <a href="Archduke%20Albrecht%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen</a>. In the evening, he returned to the opera house for a performance of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>'s "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>". The next two days were spent sightseeing, including the <a href="Sch%C3%B6nbrunn%20Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a>, <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Vienna">St. Stephen's Cathedral</a>, the <a href="Votive%20Church%2C%20Vienna">Votive Church</a>, and the "<a href="Neue%20Freie%20Presse">Neue Freie Presse</a>".

On August 8, the King and his friends took the evening train to Paris.

The Royal party arrived at the <a href="Gare%20de%20l%27Est%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29">Gare de l'Est</a> train station in Paris in the pre-dawn hours of August 10, rejoined by Macfarlane. Most of the first day they remained in their suite, recovering from travel exhaustion. They soon ventured out to see to the <a href="Auteuil%20Hippodrome">Auteuil Hippodrome</a>, and stopped by various concert halls.

Armstrong noted that the party was received with "the <a href="cold%20shoulder">cold shoulder</a>" by diplomatic authorities for the first time on their trip, while the King in return considered them to be a "mean lot". They had to apologize for the diplomatic slight from the earlier July stopover, and explain the reason why an invitation for the King, received while they were still in London, to attend the <a href="Bastille%20Day">Bastille Day</a> celebration as a guest of <a href="Jules%20Gr%C3%A9vy">President Grévy</a> was left unanswered. After the tension was smoothed out, the <a href="Jules%20Barth%C3%A9lemy-Saint-Hilaire">French foreign minister</a> visited the King in the absence of the president who was not in the capital at that time.

Otherwise, their stay in Paris was filled with well-wishers who came to call at the hotel. Queen Victoria sent her <a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a> to present him with the Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Michael%20and%20St.%20George">Order of St. Michael and St. George</a>. After days of visitors, which included world dignitaries and representatives of two different Masonic lodges, Kalākaua and friends attended a performance of <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>'s opera "<a href="Aida">Aida</a>". He was given a tour of the headquarters of "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>", and visited the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20de%20g%C3%A9ographie">Société de géographie</a>. On August 15, the royal group, which now included Hoffnung, left on the evening train, bound for Portugal and Spain.

Portuguese immigrants had been in Hawaii since the whaling days. Many of them were mixed blood <a href="Afro-Portuguese">Afro-Portuguese</a> sailors who found the brown-skinned Native Hawaiians free of racial bias towards them. The first Portuguese plantation labor emigration to Hawaii came from the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> in 1878, starved out of their homelands by widespread grape vine fungus. They emigrated mostly in family groups, joining an established community of their own culture.

Armstrong's instructions for <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a> were to negotiate an expanded treaty with the government. They arrived at <a href="Santa%20Apol%C3%B3nia%20railway%20station">Santa Apolónia railway station</a> in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> on August 19. Kalākaua was presented with the Grand Cross <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Immaculate%20Conception%20of%20Vila%20Vi%C3%A7osa">Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa</a> during an audience with <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20I%20of%20Portugal">King Luís I</a> at the <a href="Palace%20of%20Ajuda">Palace of Ajuda</a>, and also attended a bullfight with Luis's father <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Portugal">King Ferdinand II</a> at the <a href="Pena%20Palace">Pena Palace</a>. When they left Portugal on August 24, Armstrong remained behind to initiate a treaty.

The royal group toured Madrid on August 24, visiting the Royal Army, <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a>, and <a href="Buen%20Retiro%20Park">Buen Retiro Park</a>. The Spanish minister presented Kalākaua with the <a href="Order%20of%20Charles%20III">Order of Charles III</a>. An announcement was released to the newspapers that an arrangement had been made for Portugal to send 300 families to the Hawaiian Islands in the near future. They departed for Paris on August 25.

Winding down his tour, Kalākaua's schedule became less hectic. He spent most of August 27 relaxing in his hotel suite in Paris, and attending to his personal correspondence. A little sightseeing was done over the next two days: Napoleon's tomb at <a href="Les%20Invalides">Les Invalides</a>, <a href="Bal%20Mabille">Bal Mabille</a>, the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, and <a href="Palais%20Bourbon">Palais Bourbon</a>. Dutch heir-apparent <a href="Alexander%2C%20Prince%20of%20Orange">Alexander, Prince of Orange</a>, visited the King to thank him for the Grand Cross of the Order of Kalākaua. The King spent his remaining day in the city, August 30, in his hotel suite, saying his farewells.

The train carrying Kalākaua and his travel companions arrived in London at <a href="Charing%20Cross%20railway%20station">Charing Cross railway station</a> the morning of August 31. In the evening they all attended a performance at <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane Theatre</a>. Armstrong left for New York City on September 1, as the rest of the party went sightseeing and visited the tomb of <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a> in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. The following day they visited the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, and later in the day, Kalākaua received the <a href="Order%20of%20Vasa">Royal Order of Vasa</a> from Sweden's chargé d'affaires. On September 3, the royal party visited the Blenheim Gun and Small Arms Works, where they lunched with several dignitaries. After services at St Paul's Cathedral, Kalākaua bestowed the <a href="Royal%20Order%20of%20Kal%C4%81kaua">Royal Order of Kalākaua</a> on Hoffnung for his service during their travels around Europe. On September 6, he paid a farewell visit to the Prince and Princess of Wales, before departing for Glasgow, Scotland.

Kalākaua arrived in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> on September 7. The <a href="Lord%20Provost%20of%20Glasgow">Lord Provost of Glasgow</a> and the magistrates hosted the King at a dinner party, where he gave a speech praising the contributions of Scotsmen in Hawaii. For the rest of his stay, he toured <a href="Loch%20Lomond">Loch Lomond</a> and the <a href="River%20Clyde">River Clyde</a>. Visiting <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> on September 9, he toured <a href="Dreghorn%20Castle">Dreghorn Castle</a> and <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Garden%20Edinburgh">the Royal Botanic Garden</a>, where he planted two maple trees. Kalākaua appeared at Freemason Hall to loud cheers. The Grand Conclave of Scotland of the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine made him an honorary member.

Hawaii's royal tourists departed for America via Liverpool on September 13.

The steamship "Celtic" pulled into <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York Harbor</a> on September 23, carrying Kalākaua, Judd, Macfarlane, and von Oelhoffen. Awaiting them on the dock were Armstrong, Hawaiian consul general Elisha Hunt Allen, Jr. and Claus Spreckels. New York was in mourning over the September 19 death of President Garfield. Out of respect to the solemnity of the tragedy, Kalākaua attended no public or private functions in the city. The royal party did, however, spend a day as private tourists at <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a>.

In Vienna during the first week in August, Kalākaua had made the acquaintance of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" co-founder <a href="George%20Jones%20%28publisher%29">George Jones</a>, who noticed the King had an interest in <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>'s work with electric lighting. Returning to New York, Jones arranged for Kalākaua and Armstrong to visit Edison on September 25. The King expressed an urgent need for Honolulu to upgrade its street lighting, which at that time was provided by <a href="kerosene%20lamp">kerosene lamp</a>s. Edison demonstrated some electric light bulbs, and Kalākaua showed interest in the technical details. "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28New%20York%29">The Sun</a>" newspaper reported that Armstrong joked with Edison about generating electric power from <a href="List%20of%20volcanoes%20in%20the%20Hawaiian%20%E2%80%93%20Emperor%20seamount%20chain">Hawaiian volcanoes</a>. They left the city by train on the following day for <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, staying there for a brief rest, and then heading south to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.%20C.">Washington, D. C.</a>
Arriving in Washington, D. C. on September 27, they stayed at the <a href="Arlington%20Hotel%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Arlington Hotel</a>. On the following day, the party was introduced by the Assistant Secretary of State <a href="Robert%20R.%20Hitt">Robert R. Hitt</a> to the newly inaugurated President <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, at the home of Virginia Senator <a href="John%20W.%20Johnston">John W. Johnston</a>. The informal private interview lasted only twenty minutes but was described as pleasant. Armstrong later described their similarities: "If the President had been a dark or black man, the [physical] resemblance would have been a singular one."

After the presidential visit, the royal party headed to <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> where <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William%20H.%20Hunt">William H. Hunt</a> provided a governmental vessel, the <a href="USS%20Despatch%20%281873%29">USS "Despatch"</a>, to transport them to <a href="Tidewater%20Virginia">Tidewater Virginia</a>. The King toured <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fortress Monroe</a> where General <a href="George%20W.%20Getty">George W. Getty</a> received him before spending the day with Armstrong's brother <a href="Samuel%20C.%20Armstrong">Samuel</a> at <a href="Hampton%20University">Hampton Normal and Agricultural School</a>. The King was interested in the institution's role in educating <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> in the industrial trade, a model he wanted to bring back to his people, even though Samuel Armstrong had modeled his school after the <a href="Hilo%2C%20Hawaii">Hilo</a> Boarding School in Hawaii. After a visit to the Old Soldier's Home and a reception at Virginia Hall, the party returned north to Fortress Monroe, where they witnessed a review, and then proceeded to the <a href="Norfolk%20Naval%20Shipyard">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</a>. It was reported that the royal party also visited <a href="Yorktown%2C%20Virginia">Yorktown</a> to observe the centennial celebration of <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">its siege</a>.

Returning to the capital on October 2, they boarded a train, arriving the next day at <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, where they stayed at the Grand Hotel. While Armstrong remained in Cincinnati, Kalākaua, Judd, and Macfarlane took a trip to <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, visiting the city, meeting the local dignitaries, and spending a night with General William T. Withers at his home Fairlawn, outside the city. The following day they visited the <a href="Elmendorf%20Farm">Kentucky thoroughbred farm</a> of <a href="Milton%20H.%20Sanford">Milton H. Sanford</a>, where they purchased two stallions and five mares for shipment back to Honolulu, although contradictory reports in the Louisville press stated they did not purchase any horses. Afterward they returned to Cincinnati and boarded another train heading west.

At a scheduled layover in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, they disembarked only long enough for breakfast and to answer some brief media questions before the train resumed its route. In <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, the King was the guest of honor at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of the attendees were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed exhaustion from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels joined the group at <a href="Ogden%2C%20Utah">Ogden, Utah</a>.

They arrived in California on October 11. Part of the King's stay was at the Spreckels summer home in <a href="Aptos%2C%20California">Aptos</a>, with a sightseeing trip to <a href="Lick%20Observatory">Lick Observatory</a>. While he was a guest at the Spreckels home, the sugar baron gave the King two horses and a colt. California friends of the King joined him for a farewell dinner at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco on October 22, just prior to his sailing on the steamship "Australia" back to Honolulu. Among those attending were Spreckels, Governor Perkins, California state senator <a href="Paul%20Neumann%20%28Attorney%20General%29">Paul Neumann</a>, and University of California president <a href="Horace%20Davis">Horace Davis</a>.

The "Australia" was not expected to arrive in Hawaii until October 31. Plans for Kalākaua's homecoming celebration in Hawaii had begun in August, and included every organized civic and labor union group, as well as the student body of every school on <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>. The general public was invited to participate in the festivities. Honolulu was in the final stages of preparation on October 29, when the "Australia" flying Kalākaua's royal flag sailed past <a href="Diamond%20Head%2C%20Hawaii">Diamond Head</a>, making its way to <a href="Honolulu%20Harbor">Honolulu Harbor</a>. As the alert quickly spread across Oahu, a battery of guns began firing along the waterfront from Diamond Head to the port, and a frenzied scramble began to complete the decorations. After 281 days of constant travel, Hawaii's last king was home.

The homecoming celebration went on for days. Officials and the general population of the island crowded the shoreline to cheer their returning monarch. Speeches were made in both English and <a href="Hawaiian%20language">Hawaiian</a>, and some people stood on rooftops for a glimpse. Floral arrangements permeated the city, welcome-home signs were displayed, and music was everywhere. Along his route to Iolani Palace, the procession passed beneath numerous festooned arches erected for his homecoming. A daytime parade was held in his honor. The palace was opened for the public to personally greet the King. The Honolulu Fire Department and the <a href="Stevedore">Poola</a> Association began an evening torchlight parade at a bell tower brightly lit with Chinese lanterns, and proceeded through the streets of downtown Honolulu to the palace.

Sunday, November 6 was a day when houses of worship in Honolulu offered prayers and thanks for the divine protection and safe return of their monarch. The Catholic <a href="Cathedral%20Basilica%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Peace">Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace</a> in Honolulu conducted the <a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a> hymn of praise. Attended by Kalākaua and Kapiolani, the King's ministry, and much of the Hawaiian government, thanks were given for divine protection during the royal journey. Former missionary Rev. <a href="Sereno%20Edwards%20Bishop">Sereno E. Bishop</a> of the Fort Street Church praised the King's historic journey, but condemned the Hawaiian culture for its "decrepit paganism" and "bestialities of the "hula hula"". Kalākaua and Kapiolani attended the services at the Anglican <a href="Cathedral%20Church%20of%20Saint%20Andrew%20%28Honolulu%29">Saint Andrew's Cathedral</a> as private individuals, to hear a sermon on the <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20talents%20or%20minas">Parable of the talents or minas</a> based on the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> 19:13, "And he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, 'Make use of it till I come.'"

While the King was in California on January 31, the "<a href="Straits%20Times">Straits Times</a>" of Singapore published a story that Kalākaua already had a representative in Germany finalizing the sale of the Kingdom of Hawaii. In April, Secretary of State <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> was made aware of various rumors that Kalākaua wanted to sell the kingdom to a nation other than the United States, and repeated them to Garfield, who in turn shared them in a letter to one of his friends. In an attempt to protect the interests of the United States, Blaine made it clear to British diplomat <a href="Edward%20Thornton%20%28diplomat%29">Edward Thornton</a> that priority on annexation belonged to the United States. Thornton filed a report with his government, sending a copy to Honolulu's British consul Wodehouse who shared it with Queen Dowager Emma, Princess <a href="Likelike">Likelike</a>, her husband <a href="Archibald%20Scott%20Cleghorn">Archibald Scott Cleghorn</a>, Liliʻuokalani, and her husband John Owen Dominis. Although troubled by the rumors and by Blaine's stance on annexation, none of them had any knowledge of the situation and so forwarded the report to Kalākaua.

When the King was visiting England on July 15, the "<a href="The%20Sacramento%20Union">Sacramento Daily Record-Union</a>" reprinted a defensive July 14 editorial in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" stating the rumor as fact that Kalākaua was circumnavigating the world in hopes of finding a buyer for the islands: "… Virtually, the United States has a mortgage upon the Sandwich Islands … we have a monopoly of trade of the islands, both as imports and exports …". The trade monopoly referred to was Article IV of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, which prevented Hawaii from making a like treaty with any other nation. The editorial stated that any act of acquiring the Hawaiian Islands would be viewed by the United States government as an unfriendly act.

The "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>" quoted Armstrong's response that the rumors were "frivolous and utterly false". Immediately below the quote from Armstrong was a different twist on the rumor from San Francisco, also dated July 16, and printed as fact. Sourced to "a number of the most prominent planters and merchants from the Sandwich Islands", it alleged a scheme by the King and Celso Caesar Moreno to import 1,000,000 Chinese men (but no women), conferring instant citizenship upon them, and reaping a $7 per head tax. The 1878 census population count for the entire kingdom had been only 57,985. As the tale went, Kalākaua would then hand the deed to the islands over to the Chinese government. The slant on that story was that Kalākaua's tour was his way of getting out of town after the plan backfired when vetoed by the Hawaiian government.

Upon their return trip to New York, "<a href="New%20York%20Sun">The Sun</a>" newspaper quoted Judd about the rumor of the Hawaiian Islands being for sale: "… there is no truth in it whatsoever. It is perfectly absurd." Dismissing the issue of possible annexation, Judd pinpointed the source as coming from England: "This was thought to be such a serious matter that the British government sent two men of war to Honolulu."

Minister of the Interior Henry A. P. Carter and Abraham Hoffnung were sent to Portugal in December 1881 to negotiate immigration details, signing a Provisional Convention on May 5, 1882. The steamship "Monarch" arrived in Honolulu on June 9, 1882, carrying 859 Portuguese immigrants, 458 of whom were women and children.

The United States passed the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> in 1882 to deal with what was believed to be an excess of Chinese labor-class immigrants, in particular in California. Many who were already in the United States, or were en route, went to Hawaii, and the islands were flooded with Chinese men. In 1883, between March and May, 3,400 Chinese male laborers arrived in Hawaii. The Hawaiian legislature then restricted immigration of Chinese men to 2,400 per year. Between 1878 and 1884, the population of Chinese laborers in Hawaii tripled.

The first 943 contract laborers from Japan after Kalākaua's visit arrived February 8, 1885. Included in that influx were 159 women and 108 children. "The <a href="Pacific%20Commercial%20Advertiser">Pacific Commercial Advertiser</a>" credited Kalākaua, through his efforts, influence, and "genial character", as being the major factor in the new labor force. In 1985, a bronze statue of Kalākaua was donated to the City and County of Honolulu to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the arrival of the first Japanese laborers after the King's visit to Japan. It was commissioned by the Oahu Kanyaku Imin Centennial Committee on behalf of the Japanese-American community of Hawaii. The statue is located at the corner of Kalakaua and Kapiolani avenues in Waikiki.

Armstrong's report was dismissive of any possibility of immigration from India, specifically East India. Based on their <a href="Caste%20system%20in%20India">caste system</a>, he stated that those who would emigrate would be "the ignorant and those with the least moral and intellectual power". He was repulsed by the <a href="Hinduism%20in%20India">Hindu</a> and <a href="Islam%20in%20India">Muslim</a> faiths. Among women immigrants from India, Armstrong believed, would be "single women who have gone astray", of insufficient moral character for Hawaii. An editorial in the December 17, 1881 issue of "The Pacific Commercial Advertiser" rebuked Armstrong's analysis of the Indian population. As a followup to goodwill generated by Kalākaua's visit, <a href="Curtis%20P.%20Iaukea">Curtis P. Iaukea</a> was dispatched to India and England in later years to explore the possibility of Indian immigration for sugar plantation labor.

In 1904, 23 years after the voyage, Armstrong published "Around the World with a King," his daily journal of the trip. This publication has been criticized for errors, inconsistencies and Armstrong's satirical writing style.

Not everybody was enthusiastic about Kalākaua's journey. In "Hawaii's Story", Liliʻuokalani defended her brother's efforts against those who she felt "grossly misjudged and even slandered" him. She gave no names, but said there were those who believed, or wanted to persuade others to believe, that Kalākaua was using labor immigration as a cover story to gratify his selfish desire to see the world.

The 1881 year-end retrospective of the "Pacific Commercial Advertiser" was focused on Kalākaua's journey. The newspaper took a wait-and-see attitude about what the impact of the tour would be, but looked optimistically towards the kingdom having a more secure future as an independent nation. It gave much credit to Liliʻuokalani for rising to the occasion as a capable ruler who gained respect for her performance as temporary Regent. Kalākaua was acknowledged as having brought Hawaii to the forefront of the world's attention. He was praised for his personal qualities of leadership and personality, as well as for his positive interaction with global leaders. A smaller section in same day's newspaper noted that since the journey, there had been a global increase of literary publications pertaining to Hawaii.

"Thrum's Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883" reported Kalākaua's tour expense appropriated by the government as $22,500, although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on, and exact tallies of the trip are not known. Any non-government private expenses or debts would not necessarily have become public. In a letter to Liliʻuokalani in June, the King stated they were already in danger of running out of funds to complete the trip, and that money was owed to Italy for the education of the young men who had been entrusted to Moreno. The many awards and decorations he bestowed during the trip cost the kingdom more money.

The elaborate style of European monarchies left a favorable impression on Kalākaua. Construction on <a href="Iolani%20Palace">Iolani Palace</a> had begun in 1879, and was ongoing when Kalākaua was touring the world, with an appropriation from the legislature of $80,000. Even though it was not fully completed until December 1882, the King was living there prior to his departure on his world tour. The influence of European palaces was reflected in the interior design and expensive furnishings. The final cost was $343,595. Immediately upon completion, the King invited all 120 members of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie to the palace for a lodge meeting.

Electric lighting did not come to Honolulu for another 3 years, when Iolani Palace led the way with the first electric lights in the kingdom. The monarchy invited the public to attend the first-night lighting ceremonies, and 5,000 people showed up. The <a href="Royal%20Hawaiian%20Band">Royal Hawaiian Band</a> entertained, refreshments were served, and the King on horseback paraded his troops around the grounds.
His expenditures in trying to remold Hawaii's monarchy into the European model added to the public debt, helping to increase the kingdom's expenditures on the monarchy by 50%. Kalākaua decided to have the coronation he had previously been denied due to the political climate when he was elected. On the 1883 anniversary of his 9th year in office, an elaborate public coronation ceremony was held at expenses exceeding $50,000. Kalākaua crowned himself. In 1886, Kalākaua's two-week 50th birthday Jubilee added more expense, reported by "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>" to be $75,000.

These expenses were not the sole cause of the <a href="1887%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii</a>, which Kalākaua was forced to sign, but representative of a pattern of excessive spending and grand schemes, under the helm of <a href="Walter%20Murray%20Gibson">Walter Murray Gibson</a>, that did lead to it. Gibson was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs for two non-consecutive terms, on May 20, 1882, and again on October 13, 1886. He became Minister of the Interior and <a href="Kuhina%20Nui">Prime Minister of Hawaii</a> on June 30, 1886. Gibson encouraged and approved the King's excessive expenditures, and is thought to have been the driving force behind some of them, not the least of which was the $100,000 purchase of a state steamboat for travel to the <a href="Samoan%20Islands">Samoan Islands</a> as part of Kalākaua's plan to form a Polynesian Confederation.

Avenue Range Station massacre

The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal Australians</a> by white settlers during the <a href="Australian%20frontier%20wars">Australian frontier wars</a>. It occurred in about September 1848 at <a href="Avenue%20Range%2C%20South%20Australia">Avenue Range</a>, a <a href="sheep%20station">sheep station</a> in the southeast of the <a href="Colony%20of%20South%20Australia">Colony of South Australia</a>.

Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an "old man blind and infirm". Another account published by <a href="Christina%20Smith%20%28missionary%29">Christina Smith</a> in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the <a href="Tanganekald%20people">Tanganekald people</a>. Pastoralist <a href="James%20Brown%20%28Australian%20pastoralist%29">James Brown</a> and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep.

In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached <a href="Matthew%20Moorhouse">Matthew Moorhouse</a>, the <a href="Protector%20of%20Aborigines">Protector of Aborigines</a>. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Australia">Supreme Court of South Australia</a> for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve <a href="capital%20punishment%20in%20Australia">capital punishment</a>. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who <a href="Committal%20procedure">committed him for trial</a> told a friend that there was "little question of the butchery or the butcher".

Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> to establish an alibi. Historians Robert Foster, Rick Hosking and Amanda Nettelbeck contend that these "pioneer legend" alterations downplayed the seriousness of the crime.

The <a href="colony">colony</a> of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> was <a href="Proclamation%20Day%20%28South%20Australia%29">established</a> by white settlers in December 1836. In early 1839, settlers began spreading out from the capital, <a href="Adelaide%20city%20centre">Adelaide</a>. That May, <a href="James%20Brown%20%28Australian%20pastoralist%29">James Brown</a> and his brother Archibald arrived in the colony from Scotland. The following year, they took up a property in the <a href="Encounter%20Bay">Encounter Bay</a> district about south of the capital. James then branched off on his own and established <a href="Avenue%20Range%2C%20South%20Australia">Avenue Range</a>, a <a href="sheep%20station">pastoral run</a> in the <a href="Guichen%20Bay">Guichen Bay</a> district, about southeast of Adelaide.

In common with other areas of Australia, settlers on the frontier in southeast South Australia employed various tactics to deal with <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> resistance to being forced off their land. Initially, settlers attempted to keep them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to using actual violence, hoping that by terrorising them they could prevent them from interfering with stock and other property. Violence by settlers towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in March 1847 for the murder of an Aboriginal man in the colony's southeast – the only such sentence carried out in the history of South Australia's early white settlement. This undeclared and covert fighting between settlers and Aboriginal people in South Australia is considered part of the <a href="Australian%20frontier%20wars">Australian frontier wars</a>.

Reports were received by the colonial authorities in January 1849 that some Aboriginal people had been killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the <a href="Protector%20of%20Aborigines">Protector of Aborigines</a>, <a href="Matthew%20Moorhouse">Matthew Moorhouse</a> arrived in the district to investigate. Moorhouse's role was to safeguard the rights and interests of Aboriginal people within the colony. He began his inquiries assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse to the site of the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that, on the day the killings occurred, he and a white man named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went to see what was happening and, from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, whom he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present. Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a gun in his hand. Brown's overseer, Eastwood, was suspected of being his accomplice.

Moorhouse and his party then examined the scene, locating five holes containing human remains. Scattered nearby they found human bones and <a href="cartridge%20paper">cartridge paper</a> discharged from a firearm. Eighty paces from the graves they located the remains of a fire which contained more bones. Moorhouse concluded that the bodies had first been buried, but later exhumed and burnt in an attempt to destroy the evidence. The date of the massacre is unclear. Moorhouse's original report in March 1849 stated that it had occurred some months before, and in his published report of October 1849, he placed it "about September" of 1848.

On 1 March 1849, Brown was charged with the murder of "unknown aboriginal natives". In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, CaptainG.V.Butler, who <a href="Committal%20procedure">committed him for trial</a>. In May, Butler wrote a letter to <a href="Charles%20Hervey%20Bagot">Charles Hervey Bagot</a>, a member of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Legislative%20Council">South Australian Legislative Council</a>, in which he listed the victims as one "old man blind and infirm", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was "little question of the butchery or the butcher".

Brown's trial came before the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Australia">Supreme Court</a> in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the <a href="Aboriginal%20Witnesses%20Act">Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848</a> regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the <a href="oath">oath</a>, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an "uncivilised person or persons" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given "great suspicion rested on the case", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.

In July 1849, the South Australian <a href="Advocate%20General">Advocate General</a> produced a summary of the investigation to date. Several difficulties were detailed, including the fact that Parker denied any knowledge of the crime, as did others who were believed to have heard the incident, discussed in Brown's presence. Brown's co-accused, Eastwood, alias "Yorkie", had fled when the investigation began and had apparently left the colony aboard a <a href="Whaler">whaling ship</a> off <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>. An important witness named Joice had gone to the neighbouring <a href="Port%20Phillip%20District">Port Phillip District</a> of the colony of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, and Leandermin himself, who it appears was being detained at Guichen Bay, absconded and had allegedly been "made away with". The remaining witnesses were those that knew Brown, and apparently would not give evidence against him. Despite the extremely difficult task faced by the prosecution under these circumstances, the Advocate General ordered that investigations continue and issued warrants for the arrest of those that had fled South Australia. Brown appeared at the Supreme Court yet again on 10 and 28 September, but the judge again refused to hear the case without further evidence. By the November sittings of the court, Brown's case had been removed from the listings, and this was the end of the matter as far as the formal investigation was concerned. Effectively, settler solidarity and the law of evidence ensured that Brown was never tried for the murders, despite the fact that those involved in the investigation had no doubt of his guilt. Possibly in response to Brown's case, the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 was amended in July 1849 to allow a person to be convicted on the sole testimony of an Aboriginal person.

In 1880, while Brown was still alive, the lay missionary <a href="Christina%20Smith%20%28missionary%29">Christina Smith</a> wrote a book, "The Booandik Tribe of South Australian Aborigines", which was published in Adelaide. It included memoirs from her time in the <a href="Rivoli%20Bay">Rivoli Bay</a> district, some southeast of Guichen Bay. One of these was about an Aboriginal boy called Wergon, whom she had adopted in the 1840s. Wergon had converted to Christianity and went on several journeys to try to convert the local Aboriginal people. One of these evangelical visits was to the country of the Wattatonga tribe, a group whose traditional lands included the newly established Avenue Range Station. He returned from this trip to tell Smith that eleven of the tribe had been massacred by two white men. Wergon had persuaded a witness whose parents had apparently been killed in the massacre to return with him. According to Wergon, "the white men had shown no mercy to the grey-headed old man or to the helpless infant on its mother's breast", and the apparent motive for the massacre was the killing of sheep belonging to a settler in the Guichen Bay district. Smith's account did not include how the massacre was carried out, but did include the details that it was investigated, the bodies of the victims were burnt, and the murderer was discharged for lack of evidence. Smith did not name the settlers. In their 2001 book, the historians Robert Foster, Rick Hosking and Amanda Nettelbeck considered this unsurprising, given that Brown was alive and living nearby at the time Smith's book was published. While circumspect about naming Brown, Smith essentially recounted important details of the massacre in her book published over thirty years after it occurred.

Brown became wealthy through his pastoral interests, and by the 1860s had expanded his holdings to . He died in February 1890, and three years later <a href="Simpson%20Newland">Simpson Newland</a> published his novel, "Paving the Way, a Romance of the Australian Bush". It contained a fictionalisation of actual events on the frontier. One of the stories in the book is that of Roland Grantley, a pastoral property owner, and his overseer "Darkie", also a white man. In this account, Grantley and Darkie shoot a group of Aboriginal people in response to attacks on shepherds and the killing of stock. The story says that 10–12 Aboriginal people were killed in the massacre, and many more wounded. The bodies are burnt. The police investigate, and Darkie, not wanting to implicate his employer, flees the district on Grantley's prize horse, using his bush skills to elude his pursuers. He swims the horse across the mouth of the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a>, then finds passage on a whaling ship off Kangaroo Island. This account, though using fictional names, essentially retold basic known facts of the case against Brown.

In <a href="Rodney%20Cockburn">Rodney Cockburn</a>'s 1927 book, "The Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia", Brown was described as a great benefactor, whose deceased estate had been used by his widow to establish "two great charitable institutions", the Kalyra Consumptive Home at <a href="Belair%2C%20South%20Australia">Belair</a>, and Estcourt House Convalescent Home at <a href="Grange%2C%20South%20Australia">Grange</a>. Cockburn remarked on the lack of publicity enjoyed by Brown, and explained that he had "received a severe set back" early in his career after being accused of "poisoning a blackfellow". He went on to claim that Brown was found not guilty of the murder by a jury, and defended Brown's reputation, stating that the poisoning incident was part and parcel of "the circumstances and conditions of the day". Foster et al. note that there is no evidence of Brown being involved in a poisoning, despite poisonings of Aboriginal people by white settlers having occurred in the southeast of the colony prior to Brown's arrival. They further note Brown also only ever appeared in court on one matter, that of the shooting of the Aboriginal group in 1848, which never went to trial. They surmise that the shooting may have become mixed up in some people's minds with a poisoning that occurred on the west coast of the colony in the same year which also received significant press coverage.

In 1939, <a href="Clement%20Smith%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Clement Smith</a>, the <a href="South%20Australian%20House%20of%20Assembly">Member of Parliament</a> for the <a href="electoral%20district%20of%20Victoria">electoral district of Victoria</a>, which covered much of the southeast of the now state of South Australia, mentioned Brown during a speech in <a href="Parliament%20of%20South%20Australia">State Parliament</a>. He stated that the story was in "Paving the Way", referred to "many natives" being slaughtered, and related that he had personally seen "large quantities of bones of those natives" when crossing the swamps where they were shot down. He then spoke of Brown making an epic pony ride from his station to Adelaide, swimming across the Murray, to report to the police to meet his bail conditions. Foster et al. note that although Smith was telling the story to illustrate violence against Aboriginal people on the frontier in the context of a parliamentary debate about giving Aboriginal people greater rights, he turned it instead into "an account of a pioneer's heroic horse ride". They also note that while Smith may well have seen bones, they could not have been those of Brown's victims, as they had been collected as evidence by Moorhouse and it is highly unlikely they were returned to the scene.

In 1944, a local historian, J.G.Hastings, wrote a manuscript, entitled "The History of the Coorong", which proved influential in the development of the legend of James Brown. In it, Hastings elaborated on the poisoning incident in which Brown had supposedly been involved. By this account, Brown, responding to repeated attacks on his livestock, poisoned some flour and left it accessible to local Aboriginal people, who subsequently stole the flour and ate it, many dying as a result. Having set the trap, Brown then rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi, swimming across the <a href="Murray%20Mouth">Murray Mouth</a> on his way. According to Hastings, when the case was investigated by the police, Brown's ride to Adelaide "set him in good stead". Hastings wrote that at Brown's trial, it was claimed that it was impossible that Brown had poisoned the flour and appeared in Adelaide immediately thereafter.
Hastings claimed that there was no mention of the case in police records held by archives in Adelaide, but that instead, the incident had been related to him by residents of the district who had known Brown. He also placed it as having occurred between 1860 and 1870. Foster et al. note that this date is highly unlikely, as frontier violence in the district began when <a href="squatters">squatters</a> arrived in 1843, and was tapering off by 1848 when the murders occurred. By the 1860s, Aboriginal labour was highly sought after by pastoralists in the district due to the exodus of white labourers to the <a href="Victorian%20gold%20rush">Victorian gold rush</a>.

From the 1950s onwards, stories about Brown were often included in local histories of the southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's "History of Kingston" published in 1950, and an account by local historian Verne McLaren in "Kingston Flashbacks" published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and the focus was on the horse ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and shot them. The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide to report to the police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's "A History of the Baker's Range Settlement", published in 1978. Durman reproduced a newspaper article about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, and then told of a "wonderful feat of horsemanship" by Brown.

Aboriginal versions of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related a version of the story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal people and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's "The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray". Three years later, the South Australian <a href="Department%20for%20Education%20and%20Child%20Development">Education Department</a> published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a <a href="Ngarrindjeri">Ngarrindjeri</a> man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation of Aboriginal workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, Aboriginal people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that although these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim of Aboriginal attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation of Aboriginal people.

, the James Brown Memorial Trust, which was formed from Brown's estate and incorporated by Act of Parliament in December 1894, continues to operate under the name Kalyra Communities as an aged care service provider in South Australia.

Foster et al. argue that it is unlikely there were two incidents, a shooting that was investigated, and a poisoning that was not, because Brown's appearance before the court is common to both stories, but is known to have only occurred in the case of the shooting murders. They advance the view that even if both incidents did occur, the original story of the shooting murders has been transformed through the filter of the "pioneer legend" into one where Brown is remembered not for committing an atrocity, but for an epic horse ride. This transformation included the morphing of a cold-blooded shooting into a sly and passive "set and forget" poisoning, where the Aboriginal victims are "complicit in their own demise" by stealing the flour. They arrive at the judgement that, by focussing on a poisoning rather than a shooting, the story plays down the seriousness of the crime. Further, they observe that the murder of Aboriginal people effectively became a plot device, while the horse ride became central to the legend. They conclude that the evolution of the story is "testament to the influence of the 'pioneer legend' in shaping White Australia's view of the past".

Nigel Williams (conservator)

Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English <a href="Conservator-restorer">conservator</a> and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo helmet</a> and the <a href="Portland%20Vase">Portland Vase</a>.

Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> <a href="ship%20burial">ship-burial</a>, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles.

The "abiding passion of his life" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered <a href="Pottery%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek vases</a> were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of , Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete.

Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in <a href="Aqaba">Aqaba</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the <a href="Institute%20of%20Conservation">Institute of Conservation</a> awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

Nigel Williams was born on 15 July 1944 in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, England. His early schooling was interrupted by rheumatic fever and slowed by dyslexia, yet he went on to study silversmithing and metal design at the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Art%20and%20Design">Central School of Arts and Crafts</a>. There he excelled. The school recommended him to the British Museum, which recruited him in 1961 to work as an assistant for the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities. Conservation was not a recognized profession at the time, and Williams became only the second member of the museum to study the field in a three-year part-time course at <a href="UCL%20Institute%20of%20Archaeology">University College London's Institute of Archaeology</a>.

After joining the British Museum in 1961 and studying conservation, Williams worked on a wide variety of antiquities. He conserved metals (including clocks and watches), glass, stone, ivory, wood, and various other organic materials, yet more than anything he worked with ceramics, which became "the abiding passion of his life." Williams also proved skillful at working with archaeological finds; among other tasks he saw to the lifting from the earth of a medieval tile kiln and a Roman mosaic—likely the <a href="Hinton%20St%20Mary%20Mosaic">Hinton St Mary Mosaic</a>, thought to be one of the earliest known depictions of <a href="Jesus">Christ</a>. His most significant work came at the beginning and the end of his professional life, with his reconstructions of the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo helmet</a> and the <a href="Portland%20Vase">Portland Vase</a>. Between these achievements Williams also pieced together the nearly 31,000 fragments of <a href="Pottery%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek vases</a> found in the wreck of , and in 1983 was promoted to Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass, a position he held until his death.

The first major success for Williams came during the re-excavation of the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> <a href="ship%20burial">ship-burial</a> from 1965–1970. In 1966 he was appointed the conservator of the Sutton Hoo finds, and in the summer of 1967 he helped with the moulding of the ship impression. The following summer the casts were reassembled in a warehouse and a <a href="fibreglass">fibreglass</a> replica made. The process was more dangerous than was then known, and left Williams allergic to <a href="styrene">styrene</a> for the rest of his life.

In 1968, as the re-excavation at Sutton Hoo reached its conclusion and with problems apparent in the reconstructions of several of the finds, Williams was put in charge of a team tasked with their continued conservation. In this capacity he conserved many of the objects, chiefly among them the helmet, shield, drinking horns, maplewood bottles, tubs, and buckets. Williams's colleagues at the museum termed the Sutton Hoo helmet his ""pièce de résistance""; the iconic artefact from England's most famous archaeological discovery, it had previously been restored in 1945–1946 by <a href="Herbert%20Maryon">Herbert Maryon</a>. Williams took this reconstruction to pieces, and from 1970 to 1971 he spent eighteen months of time and a full year of work rearranging the more than 500 fragments. No photographs of the fragments "in situ" had been taken during the original excavation in 1939, nor were their relative positions recorded. As <a href="Rupert%20Bruce-Mitford">Rupert Bruce-Mitford</a>, who oversaw the work, put it, the task for Williams "was thus reduced to a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box", and, "as it proved, a great many of the pieces missing": fitting for Williams, who did jigsaw puzzles to relax. Unveiled on 2 November 1971, the new reconstruction was met with universal acclaim. It was published the following year by Bruce-Mitford, and posthumously by Williams in 1992.

In a precursor to the work he would do on the Portland Vase, the 1970s saw Nigel Williams reconstructing fragments of smashed Greek vases. The 1798 sinking of had taken with it part of <a href="William%20Hamilton%20%28diplomat%29">Sir William Hamilton</a>'s second vase collection, where it lay in pieces for the next 200 years. A salvage operation following the wreck's 1974 discovery unearthed some 30,935 fragments, and when they were acquired by the British Museum, Williams set to work reconstructing them. This endeavour was aided by eighteenth century drawings of the vases by <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Wilhelm%20Tischbein">Tischbein</a>, and shown on television, where the instinctive talent of Williams made him become a television personality. "He worked as if he were alone, and many people remember the moment in the resulting <a href="Chronicle%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">"Chronicle"</a> programme when he uttered a four-letter word as one of his partially-completed restorations fell apart before the cameras." In 1978 Williams and his team restored seven vases, in whole or in part, for an exhibition at the museum in conjunction with the 11th International Congress of Classical Archaeology. The other vases generally did not have enough pieces remaining to allow for complete reconstructions, although ultimately 115 individual examples were identified.

The crowning achievement to Williams's career, wrote his museum colleague <a href="Kenneth%20Painter">Kenneth Painter</a>, was his 1988–1989 restoration of the <a href="Portland%20Vase">Portland Vase</a>. Regarded as "probably the most famous glass object in the world" by the "Journal of Glass Studies", the vase is "a masterpiece of Roman <a href="cameo%20glass">cameo glass</a>." First recorded in 1600–1601, the vase is dated to around 30–20 B.C., or shortly afterward. It was placed on display in the British Museum in 1810, and then intentionally smashed in 1845 by a young man who admitted to "indulging in intemperance for a week before". It was restored the same year by <a href="John%20Doubleday%20%28restorer%29">John Doubleday</a>, and then again in 1948–1949 by J. W. R. Axtell. By 1988 the adhesive used had yellowed and weakened, and Williams was tasked, alongside his assistant, Sandra Smith, with restoring the vase for a third time.

With the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s History and Archaeology Unit filming, Williams began the restoration of the vase in June 1988. He deconstructed the vase by wrapping it inside and out with blotting paper and letting it sit in a glass <a href="desiccator">desiccator</a> injected with solvents for three days, leaving it in 189 pieces. After removing the remnants of the old adhesive and cleaning the fragments, Williams used an <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a> adhesive, Hxtal NYL, in conjunction with an acrylic resin to join the pieces. Although they attempted to avoid so-called trap-outs, where the placing of a fragment prevents the next from fitting in, Williams and Smith left for Christmas in 1988 fearing that they might have to take apart six months' work in order to fit in the last few shards. These fears proved unfounded: a few more weeks spent working on the top half of the vase, and the final pieces joined perfectly. At the end of nine months' work, only 17 minuscule fragments remained unplaced, rather than the 34 that were omitted from the previous restoration. After filling in the cracks with coloured resin, Williams gave his verdict: "It's OK... ruined my Christmas."

For 20 years Williams lived with his partner Myrtle Bruce-Mitford, a professional cellist and the daughter of his colleague <a href="Rupert%20Bruce-Mitford">Rupert Bruce-Mitford</a>. The two met in 1964. She likewise contributed to the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> finds, being employed by the British Museum to work on the remnants of the lyre and co-authoring a paper with her father. She additionally revised and published the second edition of Williams's text "Porcelain: Repair and Restoration", on which he had been working at the time of his death. Williams and Bruce-Mitford had a daughter, Matty, who was born in 1976 or 1977.

Nigel Williams died of a heart attack on 21 April 1992, at the age of 47. He had recently arrived in <a href="Aqaba">Aqaba</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, and was taking a break on the beach from his work as the on-site conservator for a British Museum excavation at Tell es-Sa'idiyeh. Though his death came early, Williams, as Painter wrote, "made a great contribution to the art and science of conservation, to the archaeological record and to the preservation of great collections, and above all to the public's appreciation and understanding of the past."

The Ceramics & Glass group of the <a href="Institute%20of%20Conservation">Institute of Conservation</a> awards the biennial Nigel Williams Prize both in memory of his work, and in encouragement of high standards for those in the conservation profession. Noting the dramatic highlights of Williams's career, and "that for most conservators today the opportunities to conserve or restore high-profile objects such as the Portland Vase are rare", the Institute awards the prize "as much in a spirit of encouragement as in that of healthy competition, recognising the value of consistent and day-to-day professional practice." The three-member judging panel is headed by Sandra Smith, who restored the Portland Vase with Williams while at the British Museum; along with the £1,000 awarded to the winner comes a "virtual" image of a gilded replica of the vase, the original copy of which was donated by <a href="Wedgwood">Wedgwood</a> and is still kept in their museum.

Marcel Lihau

Marcel Antoine Lihau or Ebua Libana la Molengo Lihau (29 September 1931 – 9 April 1999) was a Congolese politician, jurist, and law professor who served as the inaugural First President of the <a href="Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%29">Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo</a> from 1968 until 1975 and was involved in the creation of two functional constitutions for the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>.

Lihau attended the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium with the help of sympathetic Jesuit educators, becoming one of the first Congolese to study law. While there he encouraged Congolese politicians to form an alliance that allowed them to secure the independence of the Congo from Belgium. He served briefly as a justice official and negotiator for the Congolese central government before being appointed to lead a commission to draft a permanent national constitution. He was made dean of law faculty at <a href="Lovanium%20University">Lovanium University</a> in 1963. The following year he helped deliver the <a href="Luluabourg%20Constitution">Luluabourg Constitution</a> to the Congolese, which was adopted by referendum. In 1965 <a href="Joseph-Desir%C3%A9%20Mobutu">Joseph-Desiré Mobutu</a> seized total control of the country and directed Lihau to produce a new constitution. Three years later Lihau was appointed First President of the new Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo. He retained the position, advocating for judicial independence, until 1975 when he refused to force a harsh sentence upon student protesters. Lihau was summarily removed from his post by Mobutu and placed under house arrest. Becoming increasingly opposed to the government, he helped found the reform-oriented <a href="Union%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Social%20Progress%20%28Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%29">Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social</a>. Mobutu responded by suspending his rights and banishing him to a rural village.

His health in decline, Lihau sought refuge from political persecution in the United States in 1985, accepting a job as a professor of constitutional law at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. He continued to advocate for democracy in the Congo and returned to the country in 1990 to discuss political reform. He went back to the United States to seek medical treatment and died there in 1999.

Marcel Lihau was born on 29 September 1931 in <a href="Bumba%2C%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Bumba</a>, <a href="%C3%89quateur%20%28former%20province%29">Équateur Province</a>, <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a>, the eldest of eight children. After his secondary education at the Bolongo seminary, he attended the Jesuit University Centre in <a href="Kisantu">Kisantu</a>, graduating from the school's administrative sciences division. One of Lihau's teachers, sociologist <a href="Willy%20De%20Craemer">Willy De Craemer</a>, resolved to help him enroll in the <a href="Catholic%20University%20of%20Leuven%20%281834%E2%80%931968%29">Université catholique de Louvain</a> in Belgium, a school mostly unavailable to Congolese. To do this, De Craemer tutored him in <a href="Classical%20Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>, and <a href="Flemish%20language">Flemish</a> so he could take the Jury Central entrance exam. Lihau passed the test with a high score and was admitted to the university. Since it was his goal to study law (not permitted to Congolese students at the time), De Craemer and several sympathetic Jesuit educators arranged for Lihau to take the necessary classes under the cover of studying Roman <a href="philology">philology</a>. He also studied economics and philosophy. For the duration of his studies he stayed with the family of a former director of <a href="L%C3%A9opoldville">Léopoldville</a> Radio, Karel Theunissen. Lihau served as president of the small Congolese-<a href="Ruanda-Urundi">Ruanda-Urundi</a> <a href="students%27%20union">students' union</a> in Belgium, Association Générale des Étudiants Congolais en Belgique (AGEC).

In 1958 a conference of Belgian missionaries was held to discuss expanding tertiary education in the Congo. As an invited speaker, Lihau encouraged Belgian clergy to join the side of Congolese activists and abandon what he referred to as an attitude of "clerical paternalism". In 1962, after spending time in the Congo, Lihau returned to Louvain to complete his studies. That year restrictions on Congolese education were loosened and Lihau became a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> law student. By the following January he had become one of the first Congolese to receive a law degree, earning it with distinction.

On the eve of the <a href="Belgo-Congolese%20Round%20Table%20Conference">Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference</a> in Brussels in January 1960, Lihau advised the Congolese political delegations to form a "Front Commun". They did, and the decision significantly strengthened their bargaining position with the Belgian government. Lihau attended the political portion of the conference as an observer on behalf of the AGEC. While there, he presented two papers compiled by the AGEC. The first, entitled "The Congo Before Independence", led the president of the conference to create one commission to discuss the future of the Congo's political institutions and another to address the upcoming elections. The second paper, entitled "The Internal Political Organisation of the Congo", compared the merits of <a href="Federalism">Federalism</a> and <a href="Unitary%20state">Unitarianism</a> and proposed that the Congolese adopt one system or the other to ensure the future integrity of their country. Before the conference dissolved, the Front Commun accepted the offer of the independence of the "<a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20%28L%C3%A9opoldville%29">Republic of the Congo</a>" on 30 June 1960. In April and May, Lihau participated in the conference that addressed the Congo's planned economic transition.

Shortly after independence, a widespread mutiny in the army and the secession of several provinces resulted in <a href="Congo%20Crisis">a domestic crisis</a>. In August Lihau met with a UN official in New York who encouraged him to disseminate support of a reconciliation between the central government and the authorities of the rebellious "<a href="State%20of%20Katanga">State of Katanga</a>". President <a href="Joseph%20Kasa-Vubu">Joseph Kasa-Vubu</a> dismissed Prime Minister <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a> in September 1960 but the latter refused to leave his post, creating a political impasse. In response, Colonel <a href="Joseph-Desir%C3%A9%20Mobutu">Joseph-Desiré Mobutu</a> launched a coup and displaced the parliamentary system. On 20 September he announced the formation of the "<a href="College%20of%20Commissioners-General">College of Commissioners-General</a>", a government made up of university students and graduates. Lihau was appointed Commissioner-General of Justice. The College was dissolved on 9 February and replaced by a new government under Prime Minister <a href="Joseph%20Il%C3%A9o">Joseph Iléo</a>. Lihau was made Secretary of State for Justice. During this time he frequently worked with Belgian advisers.

Lihau traveled to Katanga in November 1960 to negotiate with the rebellious province's leaders. He assisted in organising and subsequently took part in the Léopoldville Conference in January 1961 to discuss political compromise and reform. He also participated in the Tananarive Conference in March and the following Coquilhatville Conference in April on behalf of Iléo to try and bring about a reconciliation among the dissident factions in the Congo. As result of the latter conference, Iléo created a commission to prepare a new constitution for the Congo and appointed Lihau to chair it. Lihau played a key role in the drafting process from that point forward. In June he joined <a href="Cyrille%20Adoula">Cyrille Adoula</a> and <a href="Jean%20Bolikango">Jean Bolikango</a> in negotiating with the representatives of the <a href="Free%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Stanleyville government</a>. Their meetings continued into July and resulted in the reconvening of Parliament and the Stanleyville government agreeing to disband. In January 1963 Lihau was hired to be professor and dean of the faculty of law at <a href="Lovanium%20University">Lovanium University</a> (later the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Zaire">National University of Zaire</a>). He encouraged his students to adopt a <a href="constitutionalist">constitutionalist</a> approach to law.

On 27 November 1963 President Kasa-Vubu announced the formation of a new "Constitutional Commission". The commission convened on 10 January 1964 in <a href="Kananga">Luluabourg</a>, with Lihau serving as its secretary. A draft was completed by 11 April, but its presentation to the public was delayed as Kasa-Vubu's government and the commission debated over which faction held the prerogative to make revisions. Kasa-Vubu eventually yielded and the constitution was submitted for <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20%28L%C3%A9opoldville%29%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201964">ratification to the Congolese electorate</a> at the end of June. The "<a href="Luluabourg%20Constitution">Luluabourg Constitution</a>", as it was known, was adopted with 80 percent approval. On 26 July Lihau was made a member of the Congolese section of the <a href="International%20Commission%20of%20Jurists">International Commission of Jurists</a>. In 1965 another period of government paralysis led Mobutu to seize total control of the country. He requested that Lihau draft a new constitution, which was adopted on 24 June 1967.

On 14 August 1968 Lihau was named First President of the new <a href="Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%29">Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo</a>. He was officially installed in the position on 23 November. In his inaugural speech, Lihau requested "the scrupulous respect of all the authorities of the Republic the status of the magistracy guaranteeing independence in the exercise of its functions." Two years later he became editor of the new law journal "La Revue Congolaise de Droit" and also served as general delegate to the Office Nationale de la Recherche et du Developpement for its judicial, political, and social research division. Marcel Lihau soon adopted the name Ebua Libana la Molengo Lihau, as per the encouraged Africanisation in accordance with Mobutu's policy of <a href="Authenticit%C3%A9%20%28Zaire%29">"Authenticité"</a>. As a judge, he believed that the term "law" applied "not only to legislative acts, but also to regulatory acts which are at least not illegal, as well as international treaties and ratified agreements". In 1971 Lihau was inducted into the executive committee of the state-sanctioned party, <a href="Mouvement%20Populaire%20de%20la%20R%C3%A9volution">Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution</a> (MPR). Three years later he was made a commissioner of its political bureau. That year a <a href="Constitution%20of%20Zaire">new constitution</a> was promulgated that concentrated the government's authority in Mobutu as President. Lihau supported the independence of the judiciary and, despite Mobutu's centralisation, interpreted the document as only veiling such autonomy, not eliminating it. He explained that the constitution's references to the "Judicial Council" (a section of the MPR) in place of the previous term "Judicial Power" were, though obfuscating, done only for political reasons and signified no real change. He surmised, "[T]he attributions of courts and tribunals have remained the same as in the past, even if the spirit in which they declare the law will necessarily be different." However, this interpretation ran contrary to Mobutu's ideals. In June 1975 Lihau refused to enforce a harsh sentence levied against student protesters. He was subsequently dismissed from the Supreme Court, removed from his teaching position, and placed under house arrest.

In 1980, 13 members of Parliament published a letter criticising Mobutu's regime and were arrested for "aggravated treason". Lihau testified on their behalf during the ensuing trial. Two years later he joined them in founding the <a href="Union%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Social%20Progress%20%28Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%29">Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social</a> (UDPS) as an opposition party to Mobutu; Lihau soon became the new party's president. Mobutu was particularly disturbed by Lihau's membership in the party since, as a native of Équateur Province, he added to the geographic diversity of the organisation and therefore its political clout. In retaliation, Mobutu incarcerated him, suspended his rights, confiscated his personal property, and eventually banished him to the village of Yamake in Équateur Province. In August 1983 Lihau joined several of his colleagues in attempting to interrupt a meeting between government officials and <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States congressmen</a> at the Hotel InterContinental in <a href="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a> while wearing Western suits and ties (then banned by Mobutu). A violent struggle between the UDPS members and Mobutu's security police ensued in full view of the American delegation and received a great amount of media attention in the United States.

By 1985 Lihau's health had deteriorated and he was attempting to seek political asylum abroad. His application to Belgian authorities was refused. <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> invited him to become a visiting scholar at its campus in the United States. David Heaps, chairman of the board of <a href="Human%20Rights%20Internet">Human Rights Internet</a>, convinced Mobutu to let Lihau leave the country. He was subsequently granted political asylum in the United States, and moved to <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, to become a professor of <a href="constitutional%20law">constitutional law</a> at Harvard. Meanwhile in the Congo Mobutu persecuted the UDPS leadership, making it nearly impossible for Party President <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Tshisekedi">Étienne Tshisekedi</a> to participate in political activities. In early 1988 a dozen party executives traveled to Boston and convinced Lihau to assume the presidency of the UDPS. The following year Lihau founded a political conference with the goal of <a href="democratization">democratising</a> the Congo.
In April 1990 Mobutu announced he would accommodate multi-party politics. Lihau, who was at the time presiding over a meeting of exiled politicians in Brussels, demanded that before opposition elements returned to the country Mobutu's government guarantee the tolerance of a genuine multi-party system, agree to organise a round table conference for political reconciliation, and begin disbanding state security forces. On 22 May he visited the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a> in <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>. Lihau returned to the Congo and became one of four directors of the UDPS under a reformed leadership model. The UDPS then entered a coalition with other opposition groups to form the Union Sacrée de l'Opposition, and he served on the union's ruling council. He joined the UDPS in endorsing the formation of a "Conference Nationale Souveraine" to discuss political reform in the country. One soon convened, but Lihau protested the large number of delegates summoned by Mobutu to participate, accusing him of trying to stack the representation in his own favor. Throughout the conference's existence Lihau chaired its constitutional commission. At one point during the conference, he denounced the perceived <a href="Baluba">Baluba</a> dominance of the UDPS and joined the Alliance des Bangala (ALIBA), a party with financial support from Mobutu that promoted politicians from Équateur. Eventually the constitutional commission produced a draft recommendation of a federal system that was intended to maintain the national integrity of the Congo while respecting its diversity. The conference disbanded in December 1992 having greatly reinvigorated democratic thought in the country but ultimately failing to enact significant institutional change. Lihau went back to the United States to receive medical treatment.

In June 1993 Lihau delivered a speech on television and radio, denouncing the <a href="Kasai%20region">Kasaian</a> ethnic dominance of the UDPS and Tshisekedi's leadership. The UDPS then labeled him a "traitor" for his association with ALIBA and announced that it interpreted his statements as a resignation from the party. Kasaians close to Tshisekedi were incensed by Lihau's comments and considered assassinating him and fixing blame on Mobutu and Prime Minister <a href="Faustin%20Birindwa">Faustin Birindwa</a>.

Lihau married future politician <a href="Sophie%20Kanza">Sophie Kanza</a> on 26 December 1964. They had six daughters: Elisabeth, Anne, Irene, Catherine, Rachel and Sophie. The couple separated in the late 1970s and Lihau saw little of his family during his years in the United States. In Lihau's later life a young politician named Jean-Pierre Kalokola claimed to be his illegitimate son. In response, Lihau successfully filed a lawsuit against him. After Lihau's death, Kalokola legally adopted his surname. Lihau's daughters denounced the action as a ploy by Kalokola to further his own political career.

Lihau died on 9 April 1999 in Boston, seven days after the death of his wife in Kinshasa. He was initially buried in a Boston cemetery before his body was exhumed and entombed in <a href="Gombe%2C%20Kinshasa">Gombe, Kinshasa</a>, on 12 May. Lihau's family never requested that an autopsy be performed on the corpse. In 2001 Kalokola, ostensibly on behalf of the Lihau family, filed a complaint against unknown persons with the Attorney General of Kinshasa, claiming that Lihau had been murdered. He based his assertion on a strange visit that Lihau supposedly had with someone the day after the death of his wife and on unusual signs that were observed on Lihau's body when it was brought to Kinshasa.

John Dickie and <a href="Alan%20Rake">Alan Rake</a> described Lihau as "reserved and rather uncommunicative" but in possession of an "excellent legal mind". According to diplomat Jean-Claude N. Mbwankiem, he was "one of the best constitutionalists that the [Congo] has ever known". In 2009 a ceremony was held in memory of Lihau in Kinshasa during which a courtroom was dedicated in his name. Three of Lihau's and Kanza's daughters organised a mass of thanksgiving in their parents' honor in Gombe on 28 March 2015. Several prominent politicians attended the ceremony, including <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Kengo%20wa%20Dondo">Léon Kengo wa Dondo</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Endundo%20Bononge">José Endundo Bononge</a>.

15th Tank Corps

The 15th Tank Corps was a <a href="Tank%20corps%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">tank corps</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>. It formed in 1938 from a <a href="Mechanised%20corps%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">mechanized corps</a> and fought in the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland">Soviet invasion of Poland</a>, during which it participated in the capture of the <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a> and <a href="August%C3%B3w%20Primeval%20Forest">Augustów Forest</a> from Poland. The corps was disbanded in January 1940 at <a href="Vilnius">Wilno</a> and <a href="%C5%A0al%C4%8Dininkai">Soleczniki</a>.

The corps was re-formed in 1942 under the command of <a href="Major%20general">Major General</a> <a href="Vasily%20Koptsov">Vasily Koptsov</a> and became part of the <a href="3rd%20Tank%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">3rd Tank Army</a>. It first saw combat in the unsuccessful <a href="Kozelsk%20Offensive">Kozelsk Offensive</a> of late August and early September, a relatively small operation to encircle a German <a href="salient%20%28military%29">salient</a>, which resulted in the corps taking heavy losses in proportion to the territory gained. After spending the rest of the year in reserve, receiving new supplies and equipment, the corps was transferred to the southern front in southwestern Russia to fight in the <a href="Ostrogozhsk%E2%80%93Rossosh%20Offensive">Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive</a> during January 1943, in which it played a major role by forming part of the forces that encircled thousands of <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> troops on the middle reaches of the <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don River</a>.

In February 1943, the unit fought in <a href="Operation%20Star">Operation Star</a>, achieving its objective of capturing the key city of <a href="Kharkov">Kharkov</a> in eastern Ukraine. As the Soviet advance outran its supply lines, the corps was slowly worn down and was virtually destroyed after being surrounded by a German counteroffensive in the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Kharkov">Third Battle of Kharkov</a> during late February and early March. Koptsov was among those killed in the fighting. The corps was rebuilt in the following months and became part of the newly created <a href="3rd%20Guards%20Tank%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">3rd Guards Tank Army</a>, fighting in <a href="Operation%20Kutuzov">Operation Kutuzov</a>, the Soviet counteroffensive after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a>, in late July. For its actions in the offensive, the corps was converted into the <a href="7th%20Guards%20Tank%20Corps">7th Guards Tank Corps</a>.

The 15th Tank Corps formed in 1938 from the <a href="5th%20Mechanised%20Corps%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">5th Mechanized Corps</a> at <a href="Naro-Fominsk">Naro-Fominsk</a> in the <a href="Moscow%20Military%20District">Moscow Military District</a>, inheriting the honorific "named for (Konstantin) Kalinovsky", a Soviet military theorist. Commanded by "<a href="Komdiv">Komdiv</a>" (equivalent to <a href="Lieutenant%20general">Lieutenant General</a>) <a href="Mikhail%20Petrovich%20Petrov%20%28general%29">Mikhail Petrovich Petrov</a>, the corps included the 2nd <a href="Light%20tank">Light Tank</a> Brigade (previously the 5th Mechanized Brigade), the 27th Light Tank Brigade (formerly 10th Mechanized Brigade), the 20th Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade (formerly 50th Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade), and the 401st Separate Communications Battalion, a support unit. Soon after its formation, the corps was transferred to the <a href="Belorussian%20Special%20Military%20District">Belorussian Special Military District</a>, its headquarters located in <a href="Borisov%2C%20Belarus">Borisov</a>. The 2nd and 27th Light Tank Brigades were based in Borisov, and the 20th Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade was based in <a href="Mogilev">Mogilev</a>. The 89th Separate Air Liaison Flight formed as part of the corps at Borisov on 4 August, operating <a href="Polikarpov%20R-5">Polikarpov R-5</a> and <a href="Polikarpov%20U-2">U-2</a> biplanes.

The corps fought in the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland">Soviet invasion of Poland</a> in September 1939, as part of <a href="Ivan%20Boldin">Ivan Boldin</a>'s <a href="Dzerzhinsky%20Cavalry-Mechanized%20Group">Dzerzhinsky Cavalry-Mechanized Group</a> (KMG). The invasion was conducted under the terms of the <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a>, which divided Poland between the Soviet Union and <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and guaranteed that neither country would attack the other. At the beginning of the campaign, the 2nd Brigade had 234 <a href="BT-7">BT-7</a> light tanks and 30 <a href="BA-I">BA</a> armored cars, the 27th Brigade had 223 BT-7s and 31 BAs, and the 20th Brigade had 61 BAs; the corps thus fielded 461 tanks and 122 armored cars. On 17 September, at 05:00, the corps, advancing on the KMG's southern flank, crossed the state border, overran the Polish <a href="border%20guard">border guard</a>s, and began a rapid advance without resistance; most of the Polish troops in the east had been transferred west to fight against the <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20Poland">German invasion of Poland</a> earlier in the month. By 12:00, the 27th Brigade had reached <a href="Mir%2C%20Belarus">Mir</a> and <a href="Ajucavi%C4%8Dy">Ajucavičy</a>, overrunning the practically undefended NowosiółkiKajszówki sector of the <a href="Baranovichi">Baranovichi</a> Fortified Region. By the end of the day, the 27th Brigade had crossed the <a href="Servach%20River">Servach River</a> in the <a href="Lubanichi">Lubanichi</a> area, the 2nd Brigade had crossed the <a href="Usza%20River">Usza River</a>, and the 20th Brigade had advanced to the border at Losha. During the day, the corps suffered casualties of one killed and two wounded.On 18 September, the 27th Brigade advanced from the line of Rudašy and Zaberdowo, but was bogged down for several hours while moving through the area near Golewicze. As a result, it did not reach the Jarniewo area, west of <a href="Slonim">Slonim</a>, until the morning of 19 September. After the retreating Polish garrison burned one of the two bridges over the <a href="Shchara%20River">Shchara River</a>, the 2nd Brigade entered Slonim and disarmed 80 policemen. On 19 September, the brigade reached <a href="Vawkavysk">Vawkavysk</a>, and the corps was ordered to take <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a> and <a href="Sok%C3%B3%C5%82ka">Sokółka</a> by the end of the day, in conjunction with the motorcycle units of the <a href="4th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">4th</a> and <a href="13th%20Rifle%20Division">13th Rifle Division</a>s. At the same time the 27th Brigade captured <a href="Dvorets">Dvorets</a>, disarming 400 people and capturing 300 rifles, but fuel shortages kept the corps stretched out along the SlonimVawkavysk road awaiting refueling. The 20th Brigade approached Slonim from the east, further clogging the roads and delaying the arrival of supply units.

After receiving fuel from 07:00 on 20 September, the units of the corps began to advance on Grodno in multiple waves. At 13:00, 50 tanks from the 27th Brigade reached the southern outskirts of the city, beginning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grodno%20%281939%29">Battle of Grodno</a>. By 14:00, the 2nd Brigade had taken Sokółka, and its advance units had reached <a href="D%C4%85browa%20Bia%C5%82ostocka">Dąbrowa</a>. At the end of the day, motorcycle units of the 4th Rifle Division and battalions of the 20th Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade, which had all been delayed by fuel shortages, had reached the city. Grodno was defended by an understrength force of up to 3,000 Polish officers, <a href="gendarmes">gendarmes</a>, and volunteers who had burned the bridges across the <a href="Neman%20%28river%29">Neman</a>. The 27th Brigade's reconnaissance <a href="battalion">battalion</a> launched the first attack with 12 tanks and an <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armored car</a>, and was later joined by two tank battalions with a total of 36 tanks. By 19:00, two battalions of the 13th Rifle Division's 119th Rifle Regiment had arrived at Grodno, and on the morning of 21 September they were reinforced by two battalions of the 4th Rifle Division's 101st Rifle Regiment and the motorized detachment of the 16th Rifle Corps, the latter of which was subordinated to the corps for the duration of the battle. By the end of 20 September, the combined forces had captured the southern part of Grodno.

At 07:00 on 21 September, the artillery batteries of the two rifle regiments and the 20th Brigade commenced firing from the southern bank of the Niemen, demolishing the main Polish strongpoints—barracks, churches, and trenches—on the northern bank of the Niemen. The 119th Regiment then crossed to the north bank and rebuilt a bridge for the tanks to use. After defeating a group of Polish officers in the Poniemuń district, the regiment captured the eastern part of the city. Meanwhile, the 101st Regiment and a tank company from the 27th Brigade, which crossed the river behind the 119th, destroyed a group of about 250 officers defending the wooded hills east of the city, then advanced northeast and captured the railway station by the end of the day. The 20th Brigade captured the southwestern part of the city, but was unable to advance northward because of strong Polish resistance in the houses and trenches near the bridge and the tobacco factory. The Soviet advances on 21 September resulted in the suppression of large pockets of resistance, and during the night, remnants of the Polish defenders retreated in the direction of <a href="Sapotskin">Sapotskin</a> and <a href="Suwa%C5%82ki">Suwałki</a>.

Grodno was cleared of Polish troops on 22 September. The 27th Brigade lost two burned and 12 damaged BT-7 light tanks in the battle, some to <a href="Molotov%20cocktail">Molotov cocktail</a>s thrown by the defenders from <a href="attic">attic</a>s and trenches, and its casualties totaled 19 killed and 26 wounded. The 20th Brigade lost a <a href="BA-10">BA-10</a> to Molotov cocktails, suffering casualties of 3 killed and 20 wounded. The 16th Rifle Corps' motorized detachment lost 25 killed, 110 wounded, and a burned tank. During the battle, the corps killed 320 officers, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 194 soldiers, many of whom were crushed by tanks in the eastern part of the city. Between 20 and 21 September, they had captured 38 Polish officers, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 1,477 enlisted men, as well as 514 rifles, 146 machine guns, a <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a>, and an <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>.

One detachment from the 2nd Brigade, under the command of Major F.P. Chuvakin, was composed of a machine gun and rifle battalion and 45 tanks, 37 of which were from the brigade and the rest from the KMG. It was attached to the KMG to mop up remaining resistance in the Augustów Forest and to prevent the Poles fleeing to Lithuania. On 22 September, in the area of Sapotskin, the detachment engaged units of the Polish 101st and 102nd Uhlan Regiments, as well as the 110th Reserve Uhlan Regiment, and other units retreating from Grodno. Most of the Polish troops escaped into the forest because of the slow advance of the detachment. Around three companies of Polish troops were dispersed and several officers were killed, among them the Grodno defense commander, <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Olszyna-Wilczy%C5%84ski">Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński</a>. The retreating Polish forces left <a href="Land%20mine">mines</a>, which blew up four BT-7 tanks. Chuvakin's troops also lost 11 killed and 14 wounded.

The detachment advanced to <a href="Sejny">Sejny</a> and on 23 September reached the <a href="August%C3%B3w%20Canal">Augustów Canal</a> at Vulka, where it was stopped by Polish troops on the left bank, who had burned the bridge over the canal. A tank company forded the canal and forced the defenders to retreat, leaving nine dead. In the fighting of 22 and 23 September, the detachment killed about 40 officers and many soldiers, and captured more than 500 troops, 300 rifles, and 12 machine guns. On 23 September, the 20th Brigade moved to Dąbrowa, where it eliminated remnants of Polish units in the Augustów Forest. Two days later, 15 armored cars were detached from the brigade to relieve German troops garrisoning the <a href="Osowiec%20Fortress">Osowiec Fortress</a>, which fell in the Soviet sphere of influence under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Between 23 and 26 September, a detachment of 20 tanks and armored cars from the 27th Brigade and a rifle battalion moved along the road from Grodno to <a href="August%C3%B3w">Augustów</a>, and back again, capturing 300 prisoners along the way. During the campaign, the corps killed 78 officers, 133 non-commissioned officers, and 2,337 soldiers. It captured 322 officers, 30 non-commissioned officers, and 352 soldiers, as well as 814 rifles, 153 machine guns, a mortar, two cannons, and 15 cars.

By 2 October, the KMG was disbanded and the corps was subordinated to the <a href="3rd%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">3rd Army</a>. On 10 October, the corps headquarters and the tank brigades were stationed at Wilno, and the 20th Brigade was at Soleczniki. The 15th was disbanded along with the other tank corps in January 1940; the <a href="Main%20Military%20Council">Main Military Council</a> considered the tank corps' performance in Poland unsatisfactory, believing them to be unwieldy and difficult to control.

The corps was re-formed in May 1942 at the Moscow Armored Training Center, nearly a year after Germany had abandoned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">invaded the Soviet Union</a>. Major General <a href="Vasily%20Koptsov">Vasily Koptsov</a> took command of the formation, which included the 96th and 113th Tank Brigades, the 105th Heavy Tank Brigade, the 17th Motor Rifle Brigade, and the 5th Reconnaissance Battalion. The corps was assigned to the <a href="3rd%20Tank%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">3rd Tank Army</a> on 25 May, and as at 2 June included 150 tanks, comprising 30 <a href="KV%20tank">KV tank</a>s, 60 <a href="T-34">T-34 tanks</a>, and 60 <a href="T-60%20light%20tank">T-60 light tank</a>s. The corps concentrated in the <a href="Tula%2C%20Russia">Tula</a> area with the rest of the army, conducting intensive training exercises. After Axis forces launched the <a href="Case%20Blue">Case Blue</a> summer offensive in southern Russia in late June, <a href="Stavka">Stavka</a> believed that an attack by <a href="Army%20Group%20Centre">Army Group Centre</a> on the <a href="Oryol">Oryol</a> axis was possible, and ordered the army to concentrate in the <a href="Yefremov%20%28town%29">Yefremov</a> area. On 6 July, the army was ordered to concentrate to the west in the <a href="Chern%2C%20Tula%20Oblast">Chern</a> area, moving closer to the front. The relocation was completed by 9 July, and the 15th Tank Corps was positioned in the area of the Agnichnoye <a href="Sovkhoz">State Farm</a>, Dupny, Bolshoy Kon, Gremyachevo, Yasnyy Lug, and Korotky, where it engaged in combat training and created a defensive line in readiness to repulse a German attack. Late that month, the 96th Brigade was transferred to the <a href="Bryansk%20Front">Bryansk Front</a>, and it was replaced by the 195th Tank Brigade between 10 and 12 August.

In early August, the <a href="2nd%20Panzer%20Army">2nd Panzer Army</a> launched a limited offensive towards <a href="Sukhinichi">Sukhinichi</a> in an attempt to eliminate a Soviet salient. The attack was initially successful, but soon bogged down in the face of determined Soviet resistance. To eliminate the penetration and encircle the lead forces of the 2nd Panzer Army, the <a href="Kozelsk%20Offensive">Kozelsk Offensive</a> was launched by the 3rd Tank Army on the eastern flank of the salient. On 14 August, the order was given to relocate to the Kozelsk area in preparation for the attack; the army began moving the following night, the tanks being transported by rail. The offensive was scheduled to begin on 19 August, but was postponed to 22 August after rains turned the roads to mud, delaying the arrival of the motorized infantry and vehicles from the morning of 16 August to late on 17 August. Railway logistical difficulties resulted in the transfer of personnel and equipment being completed only on 21 August, and cargo only by the end of 24 August. Soviet preparations for the attack were detected by German intelligence, and the German troops in the salient were reinforced and began preparing strong defensive lines. At the beginning of the offensive, the corps was at full strength, with 24 KV tanks, 87 T-34s, and 48 T-60 and 21 <a href="T-70">T-70</a> light tanks, a total of 180 tanks.

For the attack, Koptsov was placed in command of a group consisting of the 15th Tank Corps and the <a href="154th%20Rifle%20Division">154th Rifle Division</a>, reinforced by support units. The group's immediate objective was to advance towards Meshalkino, Myzin, Marino, and Belyi Verkh, then cross the <a href="Vytebet">Vytebet River</a> and establish a bridgehead on its west bank. It was afterwards to surround and destroy German troops in the area of Trostyapka, Perestryazh, and Belyi Verkh, operating in conjunction with the <a href="16th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">16th</a> and the <a href="61st%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">61st Armies</a>. On the first day of the attack, the 154th and <a href="264th%20Rifle%20Division">264th Rifle Division</a>s were sent into the attack first, but could not break through. The 12th Tank Corps was committed to the fight, but came under heavy German air attack and was stopped. At 12:00, a report was received that the <a href="3rd%20Tank%20Corps">3rd Tank Corps</a> had seized Smetskiye Vyselkami and advanced westwards. Considering that the main advance was halted by German resistance, <a href="Western%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Western Front</a> commander <a href="Georgy%20Zhukov">Georgy Zhukov</a> ordered the relocation of the 15th Tank Corps to that sector. The corps was to advance towards Slobodka and Belyi Verkh, but the report of Smetskiye Vyselkami's capture proved to be false, and the 15th's vanguard suffered heavy losses approaching the village. The 105th Heavy Tank Brigade and 17th Motor Rifle Brigade captured Smetskiye Vyselkami from the <a href="56th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">56th Infantry Division</a>'s 192nd Infantry Regiment in fierce fighting by 17:00, but the corps was unable to make a breakthrough, becoming delayed by difficulties in traversing swampy terrain, getting lost while moving through forest trails, and running into <a href="minefields">minefields</a>.

The delays in the advance caused the armor to lag behind the infantry, and the tank columns came under heavy German air attack before reaching the fight on 23 August. For the next two days, the corps advanced slowly alongside other units, overcoming stubborn German resistance, before finally clearing the forests east of the Vytebet River of German troops on 25 August. The corps was unable to cross the river due to the firm German defenses on the other side. The next day, to end German resistance on the left flank, where the attacks of the 12th Tank Corps and 154th Rifle Division were unsuccessful, the corps was ordered to withdraw from the front in the Zhukovo area and reconcentrate in the forest west of Myzin. It was then to capture Sorokino in conjunction with the 12th Tank Corps and 154th Rifle Division. After moving to its new starting positions, the corps attacked at dawn on 26 August, but was again stymied by the forest terrain.

The same day, the 12th Tank Corps and 264th Rifle Division came under heavy pressure from German tank counterattacks. On 27 August, army commander <a href="Prokofy%20Romanenko">Prokofy Romanenko</a>, fearing a breakthrough from the south, ordered the 15th Corps to concentrate in the forests north of Novogryn, in readiness to counterattack if a German breakthrough took place. In the event, by the end of the day, the Soviet lines had held and the 15th was not needed in that sector. That night, it was relocated from the Myzin area to the Pakom area, where, together with the 61st Army's <a href="12th%20Guards%20Rifle%20Division">12th Guards Rifle Division</a>, it was to break German resistance near Leonovo, then develop the breakthrough towards Ukolitsa into the rear of the German troops defending against the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions and the 12th Corps at Bogdanovsky and Goskovo. On the afternoon of 28 August, the corps attacked after a 30-minute artillery bombardment and airstrikes, but was immediately stalled by an <a href="anti-tank%20ditch">anti-tank ditch</a> protected by minefields and artillery. During the night, <a href="Sapper">sappers</a> and motorized infantry managed to create passages through the ditch, but when the offensive was resumed the next morning, the 15th had advanced only before it was stopped by a second anti-tank ditch. It tried to break through during the day, but could not cross the ditch.

On the night of 29/30 August, the corps was pulled out of the line and concentrated in the forest a kilometer south of Meshalkino to carry out an attack on Sorokino in conjunction with the 154th Rifle Division and 12th Tank Corps. The attack was cancelled due to the heavy losses suffered by both the 12th Tank Corps and 154th Rifle Division in the previous fighting, and the 15th also required time to reorganize. During the day the corps' 195th Tank Brigade conducted the only combat action, a successful operation to relieve two encircled battalions of the 61st Army's <a href="156th%20Rifle%20Division">156th Rifle Division</a>. While the main forces of the 3rd Tank Army had been fighting at Sorokino, the 3rd Tank Corps had achieved a measure of success, crossed the Vytebet River, and begun fighting to capture Volosovo. As a result, the 15th Corps and the 154th were relocated to the Kumovo area on the right flank, and the 15th was tasked with exploiting the breakthrough to capture Perestryazh.

The renewed attack began on 2 September but was delayed by German air attacks. Meanwhile, a regiment from the 264th Rifle Division proved unable to cross the Vytebet River and capture the village of Ozhigovo, which was necessary for the 15th Corps to exploit the breakthrough. This forced Koptsov to commit the 17th Motor Rifle Brigade and the 113th and 195th Brigades' motor rifle battalions to the battle. The motor rifle units crossed the Vytebet River after a short artillery barrage and captured Ozhigovo by the end of the day. The 195th Brigade's tank battalions moved across the Vytebet River and attacked Perestryazh the next day, but were unable to capture the village because they were first halted by a ravine covered by German artillery, and were then counterattacked on their left flank by 40 German tanks. Although they repulsed the counterattack and destroyed 13 tanks, the 195th's advance was stopped. On 4 September, after the 3rd Tank Corps was pulled out of the line due to losses and the main forces of the 264th arrived to hold Ozhigovo, the 15th's 17th and 113th Brigades were moved to the Volosovo area, having received orders to advance on Trostyanka alongside the <a href="342nd%20Rifle%20Division">342nd Rifle Division</a>. From 5 to 9 September, the corps attempted to advance, but was repeatedly repulsed, sustaining casualties and suffering fuel and ammunition shortages. The Kozelsk Offensive ended on 9 September with the combined Soviet tank units from all three armies left with only 200 tanks out of the 700 they originally fielded.

The corps was relocated to the forests west of <a href="Kaluga">Kaluga</a> beginning on 20 September 1942 after the 3rd Tank Army became part of the <a href="Reserve%20of%20the%20Supreme%20High%20Command">Reserve of the Supreme High Command</a>. Around this time, the 17th Motor Rifle Brigade was transferred to another unit, and the 105th Brigade became part of the <a href="5th%20Tank%20Army">5th Tank Army</a>. A few days after arriving in the Kaluga area, Major General <a href="Pavel%20Rybalko">Pavel Rybalko</a> replaced Romanenko, who became commander of the 5th Tank Army. The 15th rested and conducted training while refitting with supplies and equipment for the next several months, and was relocated to the <a href="Plavsk">Plavsk</a> region on 22 October, remaining there until 26 December. The 88th Tank Brigade joined the corps at the end of November and the 52nd Motor Rifle Brigade joined in mid-December, bringing the corps back up to strength. On 22 December, the corps and the army began relocation to the <a href="Kalach-na-Donu">Kalach</a> and then the <a href="Kantemirovka">Kantemirovka</a> areas, part of the <a href="Voronezh%20Front">Voronezh Front</a>, to participate in the upcoming <a href="Ostrogozhsk%E2%80%93Rossosh%20Offensive">Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive</a>, which was aimed to defeat Axis forces on the <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Upper Don</a>. From 29 December to 13 January 1943, the corps was unloaded at the Kalach railway station. The relocation of the entire army was completed only on 15 January, due to a shortage of trains and railway congestion.

For the offensive, the corps was reinforced by the 368th Fighter Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, the 71st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, and the 47th Engineer Battalion. They were to make a breakthrough on the first day in the area between the advance of the <a href="48th%20Guards%20Rifle%20Division">48th Guards</a> and <a href="184th%20Rifle%20Division">184th Rifle Division</a>s, seizing Yekaterinovka and advancing on Varvarovka and Alexeyevka by the end of the day. The attack was scheduled to begin on 12 January 1943, but was moved back two days owing to railroad delays. By 13 January, 122 tanks from the army—most belonging to the corps' 113th and 195th Brigades—were still delayed by maintenance issues. This was because the Voronezh Front's initial offensive planning mandating that only the 12th Tank Corps would fight in the first attack, which resulted in the new tanks of the 15th being transferred to the 12th and the 12th's worn-out tanks to the 15th, although it was later decided that the entire army would fight in the operation. The 15th therefore had much less time to reorganize in preparation for the assault, and as a result of the 113th and 195th Brigades arriving in the concentration areas on 13 January with only 10 to 12 tanks due to the delays, all of the serviceable tanks were transferred to the 88th Tank Brigade, which was brought up to a strength of 74 tanks. This single brigade constituted the entirety of the corps' armored troops involved in the first day's attack, as the 113th and 195th were placed in army reserve until their tanks arrived.

The corps fought in the offensive from 14 January, tasked with advancing into the Axis rear and linking up with the <a href="40th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">40th Army</a> attacking from the north. On the first day, the corps attacked the <a href="XXIV%20Panzer%20Corps">XXIV Panzer Corps</a>, overrunning its command post and killing its commander during a advance. After taking Alexandrovka, the corps cut the RossoshAlexandrovka<a href="Rovenki%2C%20Russia">Rovenki</a> highway on 15 January by capturing Yeremovka. According to the 15th Tank Corps' reports, it had killed up to 600 Axis troops, captured 98 prisoners, 17 guns, 10 mortars, and 279 motor vehicles, and disabled five guns and 14 machine guns. This came at a cost of eight killed, 38 wounded, and one tank and three motor vehicles destroyed. The 15th then fought in the area of <a href="Olkhovatka%2C%20Olkhovatsky%20District%2C%20Voronezh%20Oblast">Olkhovatka</a> and <a href="Sheliakino">Sheliakino</a>, during which it reported killing up to 950 German troops, capturing 2,100 prisoners, 1,200 motor vehicles, 1,856 rifles, 75 machine guns, 20 guns, and eight tanks. The 15th suffered losses during this period of 11 killed, 41 wounded, and one tank and one armored vehicle disabled. Operating in conjunction with the 12th Tank Corps, the 15th broke through German defenses and on 17 January closed the <a href="encirclement">encirclement</a> ring, linking up with troops from the 40th Army's <a href="305th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">305th Rifle Division</a> at <a href="Alexeyevka%2C%20Belgorod%20Oblast">Alexeyevka</a>. This cut off the retreat for the <a href="Alpini%20Corps">Italian Alpini Corps</a> and thousands of Hungarian and German troops. During the action, it reported killing 6,506 Axis troops, capturing 11,168, and capturing or destroying large amounts of artillery, weapons, equipment and transport, while losing 132 killed, 212 wounded, 39 missing, 14 tanks, six guns, two mortars, three armored vehicles, 10 motor vehicles, and six machine guns. Until the end of 25 January, the corps fought in the reduction of the Axis pocket north of Alexeyevka and began reconcentrating on the morning of 29 January. After marching in two days, it concentrated in the <a href="Valuyki%2C%20Belgorod%20Oblast">Valuyki</a> area.

The corps continued its advance towards <a href="Kharkov">Kharkov</a> after the end of the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, against increasingly stiffening resistance from the <a href="II%20SS-Panzer%20Corps">SS-Panzer Corps</a>. On 2 February, <a href="Operation%20Star">Operation Star</a> began, the corps in the second echelon of the army as it needed refitting. The 15th went into action on 3 February, a day earlier than planned, without its refitting completed, as army commander Lieutenant General Pavel Rybalko quickened the pace of the offensive to prevent German reinforcements establishing a defensive line on the Donets. The 15th Tank Corps advanced with the <a href="160th%20Rifle%20Division">160th Rifle Division</a> towards <a href="Veliky%20Burluk">Veliky Burluk</a> and the Donets crossings at <a href="Pechengi">Pechengi</a>. The corps crossed the <a href="Burlik%20River">Burlik River</a> on 3 February and the next day captured Veliky Burluk from the <a href="2nd%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Das%20Reich">2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich</a>. At the same time the lead force of the 195th Tank Brigade, advancing ahead of the remainder of the corps, reached German positions held by the <a href="1st%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Leibstandarte%20SS%20Adolf%20Hitler">1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler</a> (LSSAH) opposite Pechengi. The brigade attempted to capture a crossing over the Pechengi with support from the 160th during the evening, but was repulsed with heavy losses. The rest of the 15th Corps and 160th Division arrived there during 5 February, and at first light on 6 February, they attacked after a short artillery bombardment, but were again repulsed. On the night of 9/10 February, the corps and the 160th Division secured the crossing sites and captured Pechengi. The corps reported 650 German soldiers killed during the fighting, at a cost of 350 killed and wounded. The 15th then pursued the retreating units of the LSSAH but the advance was stopped by German defenses at <a href="Rogan%2C%20Ukraine">Rogan</a> only east of Kharkov.

On 12 February, Rybalko began a new attack with the 15th Corps, 48th Guards Rifle Division, and the 160th attacking the eastern part of Kharkov. They pushed the LSSAH back to the inner defensive line of the city and reached the factory district in the city's eastern suburbs. Two days later, front commander <a href="Colonel%20general">Colonel General</a> <a href="Filipp%20Golikov">Filipp Golikov</a> ordered a final assault, and the corps together with the 160th renewed the attack from the east. They entered eastern Kharkov itself late on 15 February, participating in heavy street fighting with the forces of the Das Reich Division. The city was recaptured the next day, the 88th Tank Brigade taking <a href="Freedom%20Square%20%28Kharkiv%29">Dzerzhinsky Square</a> and linking up with the 40th Army's <a href="183rd%20Rifle%20Division">183rd Rifle Division</a>.

The 15th then pursued retreating German forces in the direction of <a href="Poltava">Poltava</a>. Late on 16 February, it captured <a href="Zalyutino">Zalyutino</a> and engaged German troops at <a href="Pesochnya">Pesochnya</a> on the road to <a href="Liubotyn">Liubotyn</a>. After capturing Pesochnya two days later, the 15th began the battle for Liubotyn against troops of the <a href="Grossdeutschland%20Division">Grossdeutschland Division</a>, but became bogged down in heavy fighting for the city. The corps' 195th Tank Brigade and the 160th Division were ordered to bypass the city and attempt to capture <a href="Staryi%20Merchik">Staryi Merchik</a>. On 21 February, they advanced on Liubotyn from the west, and the Grossdeutschland Division began its retreat from the city on the next day. In the battle for Liubotyn between 21 and 22 February, the corps reported killing 400 German soldiers and destroying 12 tanks, while suffering losses of 360 killed and wounded and six tanks.

On 23 February 1943, German troops from the <a href="4th%20Panzer%20Army">4th Panzer Army</a> counterattacked the <a href="Southwestern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Southwestern Front</a> troops exploiting the breakthrough to the south of Kharkov, encircling many and forcing the remainder to retreat towards the <a href="Donets">Donets</a>, beginning the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Kharkov">Third Battle of Kharkov</a>. The 3rd Tank Army was ordered to relieve the encircled troops, and the 15th Tank Corps changed direction, advancing towards <a href="Krasnohrad">Krasnograd</a>. During the last days of February, the corps fought in a fierce <a href="meeting%20engagement">meeting engagement</a> with the LSSAH and <a href="320th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">320th Infantry Division</a>. Operating alongside the <a href="111th%20Rifle%20Division">111th Rifle Division</a>, the 15th captured <a href="Novaya%20Vodolaga">Novaya Vodolaga</a> and on 26 February resumed its advance south, leaving the 195th Brigade to hold Novaya Vodolaga.

By the end of 28 February, in conjunction with the <a href="219th%20Rifle%20Division">219th Rifle Division</a>, the corps had captured <a href="Kegichevka">Kegichevka</a>, at the cost of heavy losses for the 88th Tank Brigade. The 88th was left with three T-34 tanks and two T-70s, and the other brigades were down to similar strength, leaving the entire corps with 19 tanks. Koptsov was severely wounded during the fighting on 28 February, and corps chief of staff Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Alexander%20Lozovsky">Alexander Lozovsky</a> became acting commander. By 2 March, the corps had been surrounded by the SS Panzer Corps east of Krasnograd and German tanks were in its rear at <a href="Lozovaya">Lozovaya</a>. Koptsov ordered the corps to defend the area around Kegichevka, the location of its headquarters. The 3rd Tank Army was completely surrounded and could not be relieved as it comprised most of the front's troops. Koptsov ordered a breakout, and a small number of troops with light weapons escaped the encirclement, all of the corps' 25 remaining tanks being lost. Koptsov himself was briefly captured on 2 March before dying of the wound he had received four days earlier.

Meanwhile, the 195th Tank Brigade's commander took command of 32 repaired and recovered tanks from the 12th and 15th Corps at Novaya Vodolaga, defending the town alongside the <a href="253rd%20Rifle%20Brigade">253rd Rifle Brigade</a>. There, they withstood three days of attacks from LSSAH until 6 March, when their positions began to be encircled by LSSAH and the <a href="SS-Totenkopf%20Division">SS-Totenkopf Division</a>. During the next few days the brigade retreated north of the <a href="Mzha%20River">Mzha River</a> to <a href="Rakitnoye%2C%20Belgorod%20Oblast">Rakitnoye</a>, which was given up on 9 March. The 195th then took up defensive positions in the <a href="Ozeryanka">Ozeryanka</a> area.

According to a report by the 3rd Tank Army's headquarters, the 15th Tanks Corps' strength on 14 March 1943 was only 1,000 men. By the following day, the remnants of the 15th had been concentrated in the <a href="Belyi%20Kolodez">Belyi Kholodets</a> area, and on 21 March were moved to the <a href="Nikitovka">Nikitovka</a>, <a href="Samarino">Samarino</a>, and <a href="Chepukhino">Chepukhino</a> region for rest and refitting. On 31 March the corps was ordered to become part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in the <a href="Tambov">Tambov</a> area by 4 April. Instead, by the beginning of May it had been transferred to the Moscow Military District. The corps became part of the new <a href="3rd%20Guards%20Tank%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">3rd Guards Tank Army</a> within the month, and Major General <a href="Filipp%20Rudkin">Filipp Rudkin</a> took command on 11 June. By 1 July, the corps had been rebuilt to a strength of 209 tanks and 16 <a href="self-propelled%20gun">self-propelled gun</a>s.

On 13 July, the corps became part of the Bryansk Front along with its army, and was ordered to concentrate in the <a href="Novosil">Novosil</a> area by the end of 15 July, in preparation for <a href="Operation%20Kutuzov">Operation Kutuzov</a>, the Soviet counteroffensive after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a>. After completing a march to its jumping-off point, the corps attacked on the morning of 19 July. The 12th and 15th Tank Corps crossed the <a href="Oleshen%20River">Oleshen River</a> in the first echelon of the assault and advanced by the end of the day, aided by artillery and air support. In the evening, the 15th's advance was stopped by the <a href="8th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">8th Panzer Division</a>. During the fighting on 19 July, the commander of the 113th Tank Brigade, <a href="Leonid%20Chigin">Leonid Chigin</a>, was killed in action. The strong German resistance during the day reduced the corps to 32 T-34 and 42 T-70 tanks from a strength of 129 T-34s and 68 T-70s at the start of the day.

The following day, the corps shifted northwest to capture <a href="Otrada">Otrada</a>, cutting the <a href="Mtsensk">Mtsensk</a>Oryol highway in the Vysokoye area. In the evening, the 52nd Motor Rifle Brigade crossed the <a href="Oka%20River">Oka River</a>, capturing a bridgehead near Novaya Slobodka. By the end of 21 July, the corps arrived to assist the 12th Tank Corps and the <a href="91st%20Separate%20Tank%20Brigade">91st Separate Tank Brigade</a> in the crossing of the <a href="Optushka%20River">Optushka River</a>, delayed by intense German air attacks and tank counterattacks. The next morning, all three units began crossing the river. The 195th Tank Brigade's commander, <a href="Vasily%20Lomakin">Vasily Lomakin</a>, was killed in action leading his unit on 22 July. Both Chigin and Lomakin were posthumously awarded the title <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>. On 23 July, the German defenses on the Optushka were broken, and the pursuit began. By the end of the day, the corps had reached the line of Semendyaevsky, Karpovsky, Aleksandrovka, Safonovo, and Neplyuevo.

The actions of the offensive had still failed to produce a decisive breakthrough for the army, and on 23 July the attack was shifted south, the 15th being ordered to march to concentration points at Zarya and in the Petrovo area. The march took place on the night of 23/24 July, the troops arriving on the morning of 24 July. The advance was renewed the next day, the 15th in the second echelon behind the 12th Corps. On 26 July 1943, the corps was converted into the <a href="7th%20Guards%20Tank%20Corps">7th Guards Tank Corps</a> simultaneously with the 12th Tank Corps, becoming part of the elite <a href="Soviet%20Guards">Soviet Guards</a>, in recognition of the "courage and bravery" of its actions in the offensive.

The corps' first formation was commanded by the following officer:

South China Sea raid

The South China Sea raid (designated Operation Gratitude) was an operation conducted by the <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">United States Third Fleet</a> between 10 and 20 January 1945 during the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The raid was undertaken to support the liberation of <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> in the Philippines, and targeted Japanese warships, supply <a href="convoy">convoy</a>s and aircraft in the region.

After attacking airfields and shipping at <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a> and Luzon, the Third Fleet entered the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> during the night of 9/10 January. Aircraft flying from its <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s attacked Japanese shipping off <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a> on 12 January, sinking 44 vessels. The fleet then sailed north and attacked Formosa again on the 15th of the month. Further raids were conducted against <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a> and <a href="Hainan">Hainan</a> the next day. The Third Fleet departed the South China Sea on 20 January and, after making further attacks on Formosa and the <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu Islands</a>, returned to its base on 25 January.

The Third Fleet's operations in the South China Sea were highly successful. It destroyed a large number of Japanese ships and aircraft, while losing relatively few of its own aircraft. Historians have judged the destruction of cargo vessels and oil tankers to have been the most important result of the raid, as these losses contributed to closing a supply route which was vital to the Japanese war effort. Subsequent attacks by Allied aircraft and warships forced the Japanese to cease sending ships into the South China Sea after March 1945.

During 1941 and the first months of 1942, Japan conquered or established de facto rule over almost the entire South China Sea region. Control of the sea was vital to the Japanese economy, as it was the conduit through which essential supplies of oil and other natural resources passed from occupied <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a>, <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. The situation in <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a> was particularly complex. After a <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20French%20Indochina">short military confrontation</a> in September 1940 the colonial government, which was loyal to the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> collaborationist regime, permitted the Japanese to use ports and airfields in northern Indochina. In July 1941 the Japanese occupied southern Indochina and established airfields as well as an important naval base at <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Bay">Cam Ranh Bay</a>. The French authorities remained in place as a <a href="Puppet%20state">puppet government</a>. Following the liberation of France in 1944, the colonial government sought to make contact with the new <a href="Free%20France">Free French</a> government in Paris, and began preparations to stage an uprising against the Japanese. The Japanese also developed plans in 1944 to forcibly disarm the French forces and formally take over Indochina, and their intelligence services rapidly learned of the French authorities' intentions.

As the war turned against Japan, convoys of ships passing through the South China Sea frequently came under attack from Allied submarines and – by late 1944 – aircraft. These attacks were guided by information gained from <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> and long-range air patrols, supplemented by reports from coast watchers along the Chinese coast and other observers in Asian ports. The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>' (USAAF) <a href="Fourteenth%20Air%20Force">Fourteenth Air Force</a>, which was stationed in China, regularly attacked Japanese shipping in the South China Sea area. The command also made periodic attacks on Japanese-held ports in southern China and military installations in Indochina. The Allied clandestine services undertook few activities in Indochina until the northern spring of 1945.

While losses of <a href="oil%20tanker">oil tanker</a>s and <a href="Cargo%20ship">freighters</a> were increasingly heavy, the Japanese Government continued to order ships to make the voyage through the South China Sea. In an attempt to limit losses, convoys and individual ships took routes well way from the established <a href="sea%20lane">sea lane</a>s, or sailed close to the shore and operated only at night.

The United States began the <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">liberation of the Philippines</a> on 25 October 1944, with a <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte">landing at Leyte island</a> in the central Philippines. After a base was established at Leyte, American forces <a href="Battle%20of%20Mindoro">landed at Mindoro island</a> on 13 December. This operation was conducted to secure airfields which could be used to attack Japanese shipping in the South China Sea and support the largest element of the liberation of the Philippines, a <a href="Battle%20of%20Lingayen%20Gulf">landing at Lingayen Gulf</a> in north-western Luzon that was scheduled for 9 January 1945. The <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) suffered heavy losses in its attempt to attack the Allied fleet during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> in October 1944 which, when combined with the losses during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> in June 1944, left it unable to conduct further major battles. However, it remained capable of raiding Allied positions. 

During late 1944 Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%20Jr.">William Halsey Jr.</a>, the commander of the <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">United States Third Fleet</a>, sought to conduct a raid into the South China Sea and led the development of plans for such an operation. On 21 November he asked Admiral <a href="Chester%20W.%20Nimitz">Chester W. Nimitz</a>, the head of the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">United States Pacific Fleet</a>, for permission to begin the attack but was turned down.

In December 1944 the United States Navy's high command became concerned that the IJN would attempt to cut the supply line to the planned beachhead at Lingayen Gulf. On 26 December a Japanese naval force operating from Cam Ranh Bay shelled the Allied beachhead at Mindoro, but inflicted no damage. One of the Japanese <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s involved in this operation was sunk, and all of the remaining ships were damaged by Allied air and naval attacks before returning to Cam Ranh Bay.
As further Japanese raids were expected, senior US Navy officers believed that it was necessary to destroy the IJN's remaining mobile forces, which were thought to be split between Cam Ranh Bay and the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Inland Sea</a> in Japan. At this time the Inland Sea was beyond the range of the USAAF's heavy bombers, meaning that an attack into the South China Sea was the only viable option for striking the IJN. The US Navy's intelligence service believed that the Japanese force based at Cam Ranh Bay was built around the two <a href="Ise-class%20battleship">"Ise"-class battleships</a>. Halsey and Nimitz discussed the proposed South China Sea raid during a meeting held around Christmas 1944 at the US Navy anchorage which had been established at <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> atoll in the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a>. On 28 December Nimitz gave Halsey permission to launch the attack once his fleet was no longer needed to directly support the Lingayen Gulf landings and "if major Japanese fleet units were sighted" in the area. Halsey issued the pre-prepared plans for the operation to his subordinates the same day. Its goals were to attack the Japanese fleet and shipping. In addition, the Americans believed that the presence of a powerful force in the South China Sea would discourage any further IJN operations in the area. While the Fourteenth Air Force was directed to attack Japanese shipping and airfields at Hong Kong in support of the invasion of Luzon, it was not informed of the plans for the Third Fleet to enter the South China Sea. The Fourteenth Air Force was also not briefed on the Fleet's operations during the South China Sea raid, and no attempts were made to coordinate the two forces' activities during this period.

The plans for the raid specified that the Third Fleet would enter the South China Sea via the <a href="Luzon%20Strait">Luzon Strait</a> before proceeding south-west. The fleet's aircraft carriers would attack Japanese positions on <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a>, and provide support for the landings at Lingayen Gulf on 9 January. Three submarines from the Seventh Fleet were to take up station in the South China Sea to rescue the aircrew of any American aircraft which were forced to ditch. This plan would require the Third Fleet to operate near a large number of Japanese airfields from which attacks could be mounted against the ships. Allied intelligence estimated that about 300 aircraft were usually stationed at Formosa; around 500 were in southern China and northern Indochina, a further 170 in southern Indochina, <a href="Burma">Burma</a> and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> and 280 in the Dutch East Indies. While most of these were <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%20Air%20Service">Imperial Japanese Army Air Force</a> (IJAAF) aircraft, which were less effective against warships than IJN aircraft, there was a risk that <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> tactics would be employed. In addition, weather conditions were expected to be hazardous as the South China Sea is frequently affected by <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a>s during January.
As of January 1945, the Third Fleet was built around the <a href="Fast%20Carrier%20Task%20Force">Fast Carrier Task Force</a>, which was the main US Navy strike force in the Pacific. Control of this force alternated at regular intervals between the Third and <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">Fifth Fleets</a> (commanded by Halsey and Admiral <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Spruance">Raymond A. Spruance</a> respectively), with its designation also changing from Task Force 38 to Task Force 58. As Task Force 38 it was commanded by Vice Admiral <a href="John%20S.%20McCain%20Sr.">John S. McCain Sr.</a> In January 1945 Task Force 38 was organized into three fast carrier task groups and a night carrier group. The fast carrier groups were Task Group 38.1 with four aircraft carriers, two <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, six <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and 25 destroyers; Task Group 38.2 with four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 24 destroyers; and Task Group 38.3, which comprised four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 17 destroyers. The night carrier group, Task Group 38.5, had two carriers and six destroyers, and operated with Task Group 38.2 during the day. These carrier groups embarked around 900 aircraft in total. The other major element of the fleet was a logistics force designated Task Group 30.8, which comprised a varying number of tankers and ammunition ships, several <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s transporting replacement aircraft for Task Force 38, and a large number of escorting destroyers. In addition, the fleet was assigned an anti-submarine <a href="Hunter-killer%20Group">hunter-killer force</a> designated Task Group 30.7, which comprised an escort carrier and three <a href="destroyer%20escort">destroyer escort</a>s and typically operated in support of Task Group 30.8.

Despite the American concerns, the IJN was not about to attack the Allied supply lines and Cam Ranh Bay was not a major fleet base. As of 1 January 1945, both the "Ise"-class battleships and the small number of other Japanese warships in the region were stationed at or near <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, and only escort vessels operated from Cam Ranh Bay. While large numbers of aircraft were located in Japanese-held territories bordering the South China Sea in January 1945, relatively few trained pilots were available to operate them. At this time the <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> was considering a major offensive against the supply line to Lingayen Gulf, but on 20 January 1945 it decided to concentrate Japan's defensive efforts on the area around the home islands and only conduct delaying actions elsewhere. As a result, the Japanese forces in the South China Sea region at the time of the raid were focused on preparing to resist future Allied attacks. The Japanese believed that US forces could potentially land in Indochina once the liberation of the Philippines was complete, and were also concerned about possible attacks on the area by the British-led <a href="South%20East%20Asia%20Command">South East Asia Command</a>. In an effort to better coordinate the Japanese forces in the South East Asia region, all <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and Navy units were placed under the overall control of the <a href="Southern%20Expeditionary%20Army%20Group">Southern Expeditionary Army Group</a> in January 1945. This command was led by <a href="Gensui%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">"Gensui"</a> Count <a href="Hisaichi%20Terauchi">Hisaichi Terauchi</a> from his headquarters in Singapore.

Despite these preparations, the Japanese remained unable to counter powerful attacks against shipping in the South China Sea. While the Navy's convoy escort forces had been expanded during 1944, they remained inadequate. The most common type of escort vessel, the "<a href="Kaib%C5%8Dkan">Kaibōkan</a>", was vulnerable to air attack as a result of their slow speed and weak anti-aircraft armament. The IJN also assigned few fighter aircraft to protect convoys in the South China Sea and, due to the <a href="interservice%20rivalry">interservice rivalry</a> which badly hindered the Japanese war effort, rejected an offer from the Army to provide additional fighters for this purpose just before the Third Fleet's attacks on French Indochina.

The Third Fleet sailed from Ulithi on 30 December 1944. On 3 and 4 January its aircraft carriers struck Japanese airfields on Formosa, <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> and nearby islands in an attempt to prevent them from being used to attack the Allied forces at Lingayen Gulf. In addition, its strike aircraft attacked Japanese shipping at Formosa, sinking at least three merchant vessels and damaging four <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s. Acting on a request from General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, the commander of the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, the fleet struck airfields on Luzon on 6 and 7 January. At around this time Vice-Admiral <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Kinkaid">Thomas C. Kinkaid</a>, the commander of the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">Seventh Fleet</a> which was responsible for the Lingayen Gulf landings, asked Halsey to operate west of Luzon to provide air cover during the initial period of the invasion. Halsey believed it would be inappropriate for his force to operate in such a passive role, and instead ordered further strikes on the Japanese airfields in southern Formosa which posed the greatest threat to Kinkaid's command. These took place on 9 January. During the morning of 9 January, Nimitz released the Third Fleet from directly covering the Lingayen Gulf area, and authorized it to enter the South China Sea. Once all the strike aircraft had landed that afternoon Halsey issued orders to execute the planned attack into the South China Sea. During the fleet's operations from 3 to 9 January it destroyed more than 150 Japanese aircraft, but lost 86 of its own, including 46 in accidents.

During the night of 9/10 January the main body of the Third Fleet, including Task Group 30.7, sailed through the <a href="Bashi%20Channel">Bashi Channel</a> in the northern part of the Luzon Strait. Task Group 30.8 was reduced to six fast tankers, two escort carriers and escorting warships, and reached the South China Sea via the <a href="Balintang%20Channel">Balintang Channel</a> off the northern coast of Luzon. Neither force was detected by the Japanese, though <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>s operating from the <a href="light%20aircraft%20carrier">light aircraft carrier</a> shot down three transport aircraft that were flying to Formosa from Luzon. The fleet also received a report that a large Japanese convoy of around 100 ships was sailing along the southern coast of China towards Formosa during the night of 9/10 January, but Halsey decided to not attack it as doing so would disclose that his force was in the South China Sea and possibly prompt the IJN to withdraw its battleships from the area.

While it was planned to refuel the fleet's destroyers on 10 January, this was frustrated by bad weather. Instead, the destroyers were refueled during 11 January as the fleet proceeded south-west. Once the destroyers were refueled, the Third Fleet was reorganized for combat. Two <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s and five destroyers were transferred from Task Group 38.1 to Task Group 38.2. The latter task group, under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Gerald%20F.%20Bogan">Gerald F. Bogan</a>, was intended to launch air attacks against Cam Ranh Bay from its three large <a href="fleet%20carrier">fleet carrier</a>s and single light carrier on the morning of 12 January. The Task Group's two battleships, accompanied by destroyers and cruisers, would then bombard the area and finish off ships which were damaged in the air attacks. The choice of targets was informed by intelligence passed on to the Allies by two networks of agents in Indochina. The Third Fleet remained undetected by Japanese forces on 10 and 11 January. 

Task Group 38.2 began its approach to Cam Ranh Bay at 2 pm on 11 January. It was followed by Task Groups 38.1 and 38.3, which launched fighter aircraft to provide a <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> over the fleet. Task Group 30.8 remained in the central South China Sea. Before dawn on 12 January, Task Group 38.5 launched aircraft to search for Japanese ships in the Cam Ranh Bay area. The crews of these aircraft radioed back the location of Japanese ships, and conducted an intensive search for the two "Ise"-class battleships and any other <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s. When none were located it was believed that the warships had been hidden from view by camouflage; it took several months for the US Navy to learn that they had not been in the area. By 6 am on 12 January Task Group 38.2 was within of Cam Ranh Bay. It and the other two task groups began launching their first strikes of the day at 07:31 am, about half an hour before sunrise. The Japanese had still not detected the Third Fleet's approach, and were unprepared for an attack.
The American airmen achieved considerable success against Japanese convoys. Two waves of aircraft from Task Group 38.3 attacked a convoy of 10 ships escorted by the seven warships of the 101st Flotilla near <a href="Qui%20Nh%C6%A1n">Quinhon</a> in central Indochina and sank four fully loaded oil tankers, three freighters, the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> <a href="Japanese%20cruiser%20Kashii">"Kashii"</a> and three small escort vessels. Another convoy was located and struck near <a href="Cape%20Padaran">Cape Padaran</a> in southern Indochina, resulting in the loss of a tanker, two destroyer escorts and a <a href="patrol%20boat">patrol boat</a>. A convoy comprising seven vessels was also attacked near Cape St. James in southern Indochina, leading to two freighters, three tankers, three destroyer escorts and a <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a> being sunk or forced to beach.

American aircraft also struck Japanese shipping in the <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> area. Two freighters and a tanker were sunk at Saigon, and another tanker was destroyed off the coast. In addition, the disarmed French cruiser <a href="French%20cruiser%20Lamotte-Picquet">"Lamotte-Picquet"</a> was mistakenly attacked and sunk at Saigon, despite still flying the French flag. A large number of other ships were damaged in the Saigon area, including five freighters, two tankers, three landing craft, two to four destroyer escorts, a <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a> and a patrol boat. Several of these ships were <a href="Beaching%20%28nautical%29">beached</a>, and destroyed by a storm later in the month. Other Third Fleet aircraft were used to maintain a combat air patrol over the area between <a href="Danang">Tourane</a> in central Indochina and Saigon and attack airfields, docks and oil storage facilities. The railway station at <a href="Nha%20Trang">Nha Trang</a> and a bridge on the line between Saigon and <a href="Bi%C3%AAn%20H%C3%B2a">Bien Hoa</a> were also damaged. The surface strike group, which had separated from Task Group 38.2 at 6:40 am and comprised two battleships, two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and twelve destroyers, did not locate any Japanese ships. 

The attacks on 12 January were highly successful. A total of 46 Japanese ships were sunk, including 33 merchant vessels with a combined tonnage of 142,285 tons. Twelve of these merchants were tankers. The 13 warships sunk were the light cruiser "Kashii", two destroyers, seven coast defense vessels, one patrol boat, one <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a> and a military transport. While few Japanese aircraft were operational, the American airmen shot down 15 aircraft and destroyed 20 <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s at Cam Ranh Bay and another 77 aircraft at various airfields. The Third Fleet lost 23 aircraft. The French colonial government refused to hand over the downed American airmen its forces captured to the Japanese military, and provided them with escorts to the Chinese border. Civilians also rescued American airmen and helped them to escape. As a result, almost all of the US Navy aircrew from planes shot down over Indochina eventually returned to the United States via China.

At 7:31 pm on 12 January, the Third Fleet reversed course and sailed north-east to meet up with Task Group 30.8. This course was maintained the next day in order to evade a typhoon and Japanese search aircraft. Heavy seas made fuelling difficult, though all of the destroyers were eventually refueled on 13 January. On that day, Fleet Admiral <a href="Ernest%20King">Ernest King</a>, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a>, directed the Third Fleet to remain "in a strategic position to intercept enemy forces approaching the Lingayen Gulf area from either the north or the south". In passing this order on to Halsey, Nimitz authorized him to attack the <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> area if more worthwhile targets could not be located. 

On 14 January the American warships continued to refuel, despite the bad weather. All of the major warships were eventually topped up to at least 60 per cent of their fuel capacity. This consumed most of Task Group 30.8's supplies, and it later separated from the fleet to rendezvous with relief tankers near Mindoro. After fuelling was completed the Third Fleet sailed north to attack Formosa. Weather conditions continued to be bad, and at 3:00 am on 15 January McCain recommended to Halsey that the strikes be cancelled and the fleet sail south. Even so, Halsey decided to continue north and execute the attack. In addition, he ordered aircraft to be launched during 15 January to reconnoiter <a href="Amoy">Amoy</a>, <a href="Hainan">Hainan</a> island, Hong Kong, the <a href="Penghu">Pescadores Islands</a> and <a href="Shantou">Swatow</a> in search of the "Ise"-class battleships. The night carrier flew off search aircraft at 4:00 am that morning.

Strikes were launched from the aircraft carriers beginning at 7:30 am on 15 January; at this time the Third Fleet was about east-south-east of Hong Kong and south-west of Formosa. Ten fighter sweeps were dispatched to Formosa, and a further six to airfields on the coast of mainland China. In addition, eight raids were launched against shipping in the <a href="Takao%20Prefecture">Takao</a> and <a href="Zuoying%20District">Toshien</a> regions of Formosa. While large numbers of ships were located, these strikes were largely frustrated by bad weather and heavy anti-aircraft fire. The destroyer <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Hatakaze%20%281924%29">"Hatakaze"</a> and <a href="No.1-class%20landing%20ship">No.1-class landing ship</a> "T.14" were sunk at <a href="Kaohsiung">Takao City</a> and a tanker was damaged and forced aground. Several of the strikes were diverted to <a href="Magong">Mako</a> in the Pescadores Islands, where weather conditions were better, and these aircraft sank the destroyer <a href="Japanese%20destroyer%20Tsuga%20%281920%29">"Tsuga"</a>. A weather station and radio facilities in the <a href="Pratas%20Islands">Pratas Islands</a> were also attacked by aircraft operating from "Enterprise". The American pilots claimed to have shot down 16 Japanese aircraft and destroyed another 18 on the ground during the day; 12 US Navy aircraft were lost in combat and accidents. At 4:44 pm the carriers changed course to reach the position from which Hong Kong and other locations in southern China were to be attacked the next day.

The British colony of Hong Kong had been <a href="Battle%20of%20Hong%20Kong">captured by Japanese forces</a> in December 1941, and became a significant naval and logistics base. USAAF units based in China <a href="Air%20raids%20on%20the%20Hong%20Kong%20area%20%281942%E2%80%931945%29">attacked the Hong Kong area</a> from October 1942. Most of these raids involved a small number of aircraft, and typically targeted Japanese cargo ships which had been reported by Chinese guerrillas. By January 1945 the city was being regularly raided by the USAAF.
The Third Fleet's first raids for 16 January began to be launched at 7:32 am. The day's operations were focused on Hong Kong, which was struck by 138 aircraft during the morning and a further 158 in the afternoon. The raiders sunk five large tankers and an IJN oiler, and damaged several other ships. The tankers formed part of Convoy Hi 87 which had been diverted from its journey south in an attempt to avoid the Third Fleet. In addition, <a href="Kai%20Tak%20Airport">Kai Tak Airport</a> was badly damaged, and all the aircraft on the ground there at the time were destroyed. Widespread damage was also inflicted on the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20and%20Whampoa%20Dock">Kowloon and Taikoo docks</a>. Several less important targets, including the dockyard in <a href="Aberdeen%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Aberdeen</a> and trains on the <a href="Kowloon%E2%80%93Canton%20Railway">Kowloon–Canton Railway</a> were struck by pilots who had been authorized to engage targets of opportunity. The village of <a href="Hung%20Hom">Hung Hom</a>, which was located near the Kowloon docks, was heavily bombed and hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded. <a href="Stanley%20Internment%20Camp">Stanley Internment Camp</a> was also hit by a bomb which killed 14 of the Allied civilians imprisoned there. The Fourteenth Air Force's <a href="118th%20Airlift%20Squadron">118th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron</a> conducted an attack on shipping at Hong Kong on 16 January which was not coordinated with the US Navy's raids. These were the largest air attacks conducted on Hong Kong during World War II.

The Japanese garrison at Hong Kong strongly resisted the raid, using particularly effective anti-aircraft tactics which the Americans had not previously encountered. A US Navy report described the gunfire the aircraft faced as having been "intense to unbelievable". The <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">TBF Avenger</a> torpedo bombers dispatched against Hong Kong suffered particularly heavy losses as their low-level attack runs were vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. As the Avengers' torpedoes were set to run too deep these attacks achieved little. 

The Portuguese colony of <a href="Macau">Macau</a> was also struck. While Portugal <a href="Portugal%20during%20World%20War%20II">was neutral</a>, the colony's government had been forced to accept the presence of Japanese "advisers" since 1943 and had traded weapons for food supplies. The raid's main target was a stockpile of aviation fuel at the Macau Naval Aviation Center which the Allies had learned from local agents was to be sold to the Japanese. The fort of Dona Maria II was also attacked, possibly to destroy a radio station located within or near it, and some damage was inflicted on civilian areas and the city's harbor. Two soldiers and several civilians were killed. Macau's <a href="Military%20of%20Macau%20under%20Portuguese%20rule">garrison</a> had no effective anti-aircraft weapons, and did not fire on the American aircraft. Writing in 2016, historian Geoffrey C. Gunn stated that it was unclear why Macau was attacked given that the US Government's policy was to respect Macau's neutrality and the gains from destroying the fuel stocks were more than outweighed by the likely diplomatic repercussions. He judged that US Naval intelligence was unaware of the policy towards the colony.

Other attacks were conducted against locations in southern China during 16 January. Strikes were made on the city of <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a>, and two raids and two fighter sweeps were conducted against locations in Hainan. In addition, fighter aircraft attacked airfields along the Chinese coast between the <a href="Leizhou%20Peninsula">Leizhou Peninsula</a> in the west to Swatow in the east, but encountered few Japanese aircraft. 

American casualties on 16 January were 22 aircraft shot down in combat and 27 lost in accidents. The Japanese claimed to have downed 10 aircraft over Hong Kong alone. The US Navy pilots reported destroying 13 Japanese aircraft. At least four American airmen were taken prisoner after their planes were shot down near Hong Kong, and a further seven evaded capture and eventually reached Allied-held regions of China. One of the American prisoners was later murdered by a lethal injection at the <a href="%C5%8Cfuna%20%28Prisoner%20of%20War%20Camp%29">Ōfuna</a> prisoner of war camp in Japan.

After completing its strikes on 16 January, the Third Fleet turned south to refuel. Because weather conditions were particularly bad the next day, fuelling was not completed. The weather worsened on 18 January, making fuelling operations impossible. During this period Japanese propaganda radio broadcasts claimed that the fleet had been "bottled up", and would be destroyed when it tried to leave the South China Sea. As his meteorologists expected bad weather to continue into 19 January, Halsey decided to depart the South China Sea via the <a href="Surigao%20Strait">Surigao Strait</a> in the central Philippines rather than sail north around Luzon. But when Nimitz learned of this he requested that the Third Fleet use the Luzon Strait, though Halsey was given discretion to make the final decision on his force's route. Nimitz's reasoning was that if the fleet sailed through the central Philippines its departure would be reported by Japanese forces on bypassed islands, possibly leading to the IJN attempting a raid against the Allied supply lines. In addition, a northerly passage would leave the Third Fleet better placed to undertake its next assignments, which included attacking Formosa again and reconnoitering the <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu Islands</a>.

Halsey chose to follow Nimitz's request. His fleet completed fuelling on 19 January, and proceeded north towards the Balintang Channel; Task Group 30.8 separated from the main body, however, and subsequently passed through the Surigao Strait. During 20 January the fleet sailed east through the Balintang Channel, with a <a href="Division%20%28naval%29">division</a> of destroyers patrolling well ahead of the carrier task groups. A large number of Japanese aircraft were detected by radar during this period, and 15 which were evacuating IJAAF personnel from Luzon were shot down. No attack was made against the American force. The Third Fleet exited the Balintang Channel at 10 pm that night.

After departing the South China Sea, the Third Fleet proceeded to its next assignments. It attacked airfields and harbors on Formosa again on 21 January, with ten merchant ships being sunk at Takao. But a Japanese aircraft struck the light aircraft carrier with two small bombs and the fleet carrier was badly damaged by two kamikazes. The destroyer was also hit by a kamikaze but suffered little damage. In addition, McCain's flagship suffered considerable damage when a bomb fell from a TBF Avenger which had just landed and exploded on her flight deck. "Hancock" and "Ticonderoga" were detached from the fleet, and proceeded to Ulithi for repairs. On 22 January the remaining carriers struck the Ryukyu Islands. The main goal of this operation was to gain photographic coverage of Okinawa to help plan an <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">invasion of the island</a>, and airfields and shipping were also attacked. Once this task was completed, the fleet turned south for Ulithi in the evening of 22 January, and arrived there on 25 January. The next day Halsey handed command over to Spruance, and it became the Fifth Fleet.

The South China Sea raid was considered a success. During its operations in the South China Sea between 10 and 20 January, the Third Fleet sailed without suffering heavy casualties or a serious mishap. Nimitz later stated that "the sortie into the South China Sea was well-conceived and brilliantly executed" and praised the planning for the fleet's logistical support. He regretted that Japanese capital ships had not been located and attacked. In 1995 the historian John Prados wrote that the Japanese "convoy losses off French Indochina were the most significant outcome of Operation Gratitude". Similarly, Mark P. Parillo judged in 1993 that the destruction of 25 oil tankers during the raid "spelled doom for any long-term Japanese resistance".

The Japanese high command believed that the raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south China. In response, five additional infantry <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> were assigned to the defense of this area. Three of these divisions were released for other operations in March 1945 after the American <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">invasion of Iwo Jima</a> was interpreted as evidence that the Hong Kong-Canton area would be bypassed rather than attacked.

The South China Sea raid also contributed to the <a href="Japanese%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20in%20French%20Indochina">Japanese takeover</a> of Indochina. The commander of the Imperial Japanese Army forces in Indochina, Lieutenant General <a href="Yuitsu%20Tsuchihashi">Yuitsu Tsuchihashi</a>, believed that the raid was the precursor an Allied invasion of the area. In reality, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> had decided that the US would not participate in the liberation of Indochina and there were no plans for such an operation. As part of efforts to prepare for an Allied invasion and pre-empt the French uprising, on 26 February the Japanese Government authorized the military command in Indochina to execute the takeover plans once preparations were complete. This occurred on 9 March, with the Japanese forces attacking and rapidly defeating most of the French garrisons. The Japanese subsequently installed Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bao Dai</a> to rule over the puppet <a href="Empire%20of%20Vietnam">Empire of Vietnam</a>, <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Cambodia%23Collaborationist%20Kingdom%20of%20Kampuchea">Kingdom of Cambodia</a> and <a href="Lao%20Issara">Kingdom of Laos</a>.

The Portuguese Government lodged a protest over the US Navy's violation of Macau's neutrality shortly after the raid on 16 January, and the US Government apologized for the incident on 20 January. An official court of inquiry was held, and in 1950 the United States provided Portugal with a $20.3 million compensation payment for the damage caused to Macau's harbor on 16 January and other accidental raids on 11 and 25 June 1945.

Allied air and naval attacks against Japanese shipping in the South China Sea were expanded during early 1945 as additional USAAF units moved into bases in the Philippines. Land-based patrol aircraft and medium bombers operated over the sea from liberated areas of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies from February. While Allied submarines and these aircraft failed to prevent the escape of the "Ise"-class battleships when they sailed from Singapore to Japan during <a href="Operation%20Kita">Operation Kita</a> in mid-February, the medium bombers were sinking large numbers of Japanese merchant ships by the end of the month. Medium and heavy bombers also raided Japanese-held ports across the South China Sea area. As a result of the air and submarine attacks, the Japanese ceased sending ships through the South China Sea in April 1945.

Paradises Lost

Paradises Lost is a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> novella by American author <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>. It was first published in 2002 as a part of the collection "". It is set during a <a href="Generation%20ship">multigenerational voyage</a> from <a href="Earth">Earth</a> to a potentially habitable planet. The protagonists, Liu Hsing and Nova Luis, are members of the fifth generation born on the ship. The story follows them as they deal with members of religious cult who do not believe in the ship stopping at its intended destination. They also face a crisis brought on by a drastic change in the ship's schedule. The novella has since been anthologized as well as adapted into an <a href="opera">opera</a> of the same name.

The novella explores the isolation brought on by space travel, as well as themes of religion and utopia. It contains elements of <a href="ecocriticism">ecocriticism</a>, or a critique of the idea that human beings are altogether separate from their natural environment. The novella and the collections it was published in received high praise from commentators. For its generation ship setting and examination of utopia, critics compared it to other Le Guin works such as "Newton's Sleep", and "<a href="The%20Telling">The Telling</a>", as well as to the works of <a href="Gene%20Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a> and <a href="Molly%20Gloss">Molly Gloss</a>. Scholar Max Haiven described the novella as "a chastening lesson in both the potential and the perils of freedom", while author <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a> said that it "shows us our own natural world as a freshly discovered Paradise Regained, a realm of wonder".

The setting of the novella is that of a <a href="Generation%20ship">multigenerational voyage</a> from <a href="Earth">Earth</a> to a planet potentially habitable by humans. Earth is referred to as "Ti Chiu", its Chinese name within the story, or as "Dichew", the children's version of the same term: the new planet is known as "Hsin Ti Chiu" ("New Earth", "Shindychew"). In describing the setting of the story in her introduction to "Paradises Lost" in 2002, Le Guin described its universe as a frequently used one: "the generic, shared, science fiction ‘future.’ In this version of it, Earth sends forth ships to the stars at speeds that are, according to our present knowledge, more or less realistic, at least potentially attainable." Le Guin identified <a href="Molly%20Gloss">Molly Gloss</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Dazzle%20of%20Day">The Dazzle of Day</a>" and <a href="Harry%20Martinson">Harry Martinson</a>’s poem "<a href="Aniara">Aniara</a>" as exemplifying this future. Though occasionally described as such, the story is not part of the <a href="Hainish%20Cycle">Hainish Cycle</a>. The title is an allusion to <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s poem "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>".

The two protagonists of the story are 5-Liu Hsing and 5-Nova Luis (known by their given names Hsing and Luis), with the "5" denoting that they are members of the fifth generation to be born aboard the ship (which is named "Discovery"). The environment of the spacecraft is highly controlled. Until the age of 7 all children roam naked, which presents no difficulties in a ship where temperature is controlled, and all disease-causing organisms have been eliminated. The population of the ship is also tightly controlled, at a figure of approximately 4,000. Individuals are required to get contraception injections every 25 days, unless they are willing to make a pledge of chastity or strict homosexuality, or intend to conceive a child. All matter on the ship is carefully recycled, with no nonessential items ever lasting more than a few years, creating a "static eternal ecology."

The planet Earth is referred to as facing the social and environmental problems expected in contemporary society. The generation that boarded the ship intended their descendants to understand and value a terrestrial existence, but over time the words and images associated with being on a planet begin to lose meaning to those on the ship, who become adapted to a shipboard existence, and struggle to understand the motivations of the zeroth generation. Aboard the "Discovery", the major religions of Earth are depicted as having gradually lost meaning, but have been replaced by the religious cult of Bliss, with members known as angels. The adherents of the cult believe that their purpose in life is to overcome their connections to a terrestrial existence. They do not see their belief as a religion, and believe that the world outside the ship is an illusion. Only the voyage itself, and not the origin or destination, matters. In contrast to much of Le Guin's science fiction, which explores interactions between humans and extraterrestrial beings, the characters in "Paradises Lost" deal with being literally "extra-terrestrial", or disconnected from terrestrial life.

The novella begins with 5-Liu Hsing, as a child, being taught about Earth through the use of virtual reality tapes, an experience which her younger self takes exception to. She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the "Discovery". As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.

Entering college at the age of 18 Hsing discovers that 4-Hiroshi Canaval, the teacher of Navigation, has asked her to be placed directly into the second-year navigation course. Hsing shows an aptitude for the subject, and in her third year chooses to make it her profession. Luis chooses to become a doctor, and their academic separation leads to Hsing and Luis slowly drawing apart from one another. Hsing finds herself attracted to Hiroshi, and the two begin a romantic relationship. Three days after their wedding Hiroshi tells Hsing that the focus of his life's work is not simply navigation, as is generally believed, but concealing a secret from the rest of the ship. A few years earlier an unexpected gravitational effect led to the ship experiencing a vast acceleration, putting it 40 years ahead of schedule; it is expected to arrive at Hsin Ti Chiu in five years.

Hiroshi tells Hsing that he and a handful of allies, who believe that the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, have been keeping news of the acceleration secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing the fact that he had known about it for a while.

A few months later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a settlement wherein the people on board can choose whether or not to stay on the ship, and also choose whether the ship stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu. Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.

The two "co-protagonists" of the book are 5-Liu Hsing and 5-Nova Luis. Both Hsing and Luis have been described as protagonists typical of Le Guin's works, being somewhat isolated from the society they live in, due to their strong individuality and the fact that they do not entirely conform to societal expectations. As with other members of their generation, Hsing and Luis grow up in an environment devoid of terrestrial ties, as a result of which they are, as children, unfamiliar with the terms "hill", "sky" and "wind". Despite not having an understanding of a planetary existence, Hsing and Luis are among the people who are not convinced by the beliefs of the angels. Instead they question those beliefs, and hold that a reality exists outside of their own human-created bubble, and are drawn to the idea of stimuli other than those created by humans.

Hsing is of Chinese and European descent, and is brought up by her father 4-Liu Yao, who works with the ship's colony of plants. While a child Hsing has a strongly negative reaction to a virtual reality recording of a tiger in a zoo, demonstrating her complete separation from the "wild" aspect of the earth, and her rejection of things that do not acknowledge her humanness and individuality. Hsing chooses to live with Yao until midway through her college career, when she moves in with 4-Hiroshi Canaval, whom she marries and by whom she has a child. While still a child Hsing develops an interest in writing poetry, and in high school shows an aptitude for physics and mathematics, which gets Hiroshi's attention. On entering college she chooses to pledge chastity rather than let her body's rhythms be controlled by the contraceptive injection. She is among those who choose to live on Hsin Ti Chiu, along with her son, whom Hiroshi names 6-Canaval Alejo.

Luis has a mixed racial background, including South American, Japanese and European heritage. He is also brought up by his father, 4-Nova Ed, a man whose life is described as being centered on his sexual activity, and who is very different from the thoughtful and introverted Luis. Luis also has a memorable experience with the virtual reality tapes, although his occurs in adolescence. Luis subverts a program by remaining in a jungle he is supposed to walk through, and just watching the animal life around him. He sees a large spotted cat, and is "transfixed" by its elegance and the fact that it simply ignores him. The brief experience with "wildness" and independence from humans, even though it is part of a human-made program, "strangely enriches" his thinking. In college Luis studies to become a doctor, and also becomes interested in exploring the educational program for future generations. This leads him to uncover the angels' attempts at erasure and propaganda, and to demanding the creation of a committee on religious manipulation. His role as a conciliator following Hiroshi's announcement leads to his election as Chair of the ship's council. Eventually he also chooses to live on Hsin Ti Chiu.

Literature scholar Tonia Payne has written that "Paradises Lost" is an example of <a href="ecocriticism">ecocriticism</a>, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are separate from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore have to create a new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story "<a href="Newton%27s%20Sleep">Newton's Sleep</a>". The inhabitants of "Discovery" become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position as a part of a continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as an understandable attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the "Birthday of the World" collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.

The portion of the story set on New Earth challenges the reader to question their own relationship to Earth: Le Guin uses the colonists' ignorance of common words to demonstrate common assumptions. The story's characters go from an environment in which their continued existence was entirely in their control, to one where it depended on the wind, the rain and the sun. The colonists suffer from headaches and other ailments because of <a href="pollen">pollen</a> and other substances in the air, making Luis realize their total dependence on the planet. Le Guin thus points out human beings' dependence on the real planet Earth. After the "Discovery" departs from New Earth, the story remains with Hsing and Luis on Hsin Ti Chiu, rather than with the ship. According to Payne, this narrative choice indicates that Le Guin sees Hsing and Luis's choice as the correct – albeit more difficult – path to take.

In the belief system of Bliss, the space outside the ship is equated with spiritual and physical danger, evil, and death. The separation the angels create between themselves and the outside of the ship also becomes a separation from history and the future, and from their own mortality. The story briefly quotes <a href="Lao%20Tzu">Lao Tzu</a> (referring to him as "Old Long Ears") and suggests that the angels' pursuit of total control over their environment is unwise: it is the "dangerous" planet of New Earth which offers the true possibility of a utopia. According to scholar Everett Hammer, writing in an anthology examining Le Guin's work, "Paradises Lost" suggests that any attempt to create a <a href="utopia">utopia</a> while ignoring the history of the people within it is bound to degenerate into a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>. Several other works of hers, including "<a href="A%20Wizard%20of%20Earthsea">A Wizard of Earthsea</a>", "<a href="The%20Telling">The Telling</a>" and "<a href="Always%20Coming%20Home">Always Coming Home</a>", also suggest that "a healthy future is not possible without an accurately understood past."

Religion is a significant theme in "Paradises Lost". According to speculative fiction scholar <a href="Brian%20Attebery">Brian Attebery</a>, the novella was a response to a rise in religious fundamentalism in the U.S. and elsewhere. Le Guin reacted to the tendency within Christian, <a href="Islamic%20fundamentalism">Islamic</a>, and <a href="Hindutva">Hindu fundamentalism</a> to reject scientific thinking and social change, and to use shared beliefs as armor against political pressure. Le Guin said in her introduction to the story that she was unable to start "Paradises Lost" until she worked in the religious theme, which in her words "began to entwine itself with the idea of the sealed ship in the dead vacuum of space, like a cocoon, full of transformation, transmutation, invisible life: the pupa body, the winged soul". The adherents of Bliss believe they are part of an eternal voyage towards perfection; its beliefs specifically address phobias that develop in the enclosed space of the ship. Attebery writes that the story serves as a parable for the role of religion on Earth, but that the setting of a generation ship prevents the "parallel from [becoming] too obtrusive." The story also explores why certain characters are resistant to the allure of Bliss; by discussing their background and upbringing, Attebery says, Le Guin "helps us believe in their ability to choose a tough material reality".

Literary critic <a href="Richard%20Erlich">Richard Erlich</a> wrote in 2006 that the depiction of the religious cult of Bliss was influenced by Le Guin's interest in <a href="Taoism">Taoist thought</a>, and an example of Le Guin's critique of Christianity. The angels use of the phrase "the planetary hypothesis" to refer to their terrestrial origin was a gentle dig at <a href="Christian%20fundamentalism">Christian fundamentalism</a> in the United States, with its insistence that <a href="evolution">evolution</a> is "merely a theory." The story also refers to the success of Christian fundamentalists in taking over <a href="School%20district">school boards</a> in the US. A more direct criticism of Christianity comes in Le Guin's depiction of the cult of Bliss being disrespectful of women, as well as of believing in a <a href="Nuclear%20family">nuclear</a>, <a href="Patriarchy">patriarchal</a> family. Bliss is portrayed as a closed system; members reinforce manipulate the ship's data banks to remove references to Earth and their destination, because they value stability even to the point of denying some of their own knowledge. A reference to Christianity is also present in Le Guin's word to describe activity outside the ship: the real-world term "<a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a>" or EVA is used as a single word "Eva," in reference to the biblical "<a href="Eve">Eve</a>": angels in the story see going outside the ship as an act of transgression associated with death.

According to Payne, Le Guin does not explicitly criticize the concept of religion in general, but the tendency within religion to reduce "reality" to that which can be contained and controlled by the human mind. This "control" is only possible within the entirely human-made environment aboard the spacecraft, which Le Guin depicts as lacking elements of the "richly textured" real world, and which denies human beings the experiences of "wildness" which make life interesting. In Payne's view the story challenges the idea, common to Western society, that human beings, and technology, can solve all problems; it does so by presenting an entire planet as a system not amenable to control. A 2002 review in "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" magazine also highlighted the religious themes in the story, stating that Le Guin offered an unusual take on the theme of religion by depicting a "cult of atheists" fed by the tendency to religious conformity among human beings. Scholar Max Haiven also said that "Paradises Lost" demonstrated the human need for myth and spirituality, and the ways in which power structures could arise even in societies planned with the intent of avoiding them. According to Haiven, the zeroth generation made the mistake of assuming that they could create a completely rational society; instead, the emerging system of religion brought with it coercion and patriarchal standards of behavior.

"Paradises Lost" was first published as a part of the collection "<a href="The%20Birthday%20of%20the%20World%20and%20Other%20Stories">The Birthday of the World and Other Stories</a>" in 2002, along with seven other stories from the period 1994–2000. "Paradises Lost" was the only original story in the book: all the others had been previously published elsewhere. According to scholar <a href="Sandra%20Lindow">Sandra Lindow</a>, all of the works in the collection (with the exception of "<a href="Old%20Music%20and%20the%20Slave%20Women">Old Music and the Slave Women</a>") examine unorthodox sexual relationships and marriage; in the case of "Paradises Lost", the tightly controlled reproduction of people aboard the ship. <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a>, however, described the "peculiar arrangements of gender and sexuality" as being restricted to the first seven stories (i.e. excluding "Paradises Lost"). Haiven wrote that a number of stories in the collection, including "Paradises Lost", "Mountain Ways", and "Old Music and the Slave Women", explored <a href="Anarchism">anarchist ideas</a>. In 2016 "Paradises Lost" was anthologized along with all 12 of Le Guin's other novellas in the volume "<a href="The%20Found%20and%20the%20Lost">The Found and the Lost</a>"; the other stories in the collection included three novellas from "<a href="Earthsea">Earthsea</a>", and several stories from the Hainish Cycle. The pieces were arranged approximately by the date they were published.

"Paradises Lost" was adapted into an <a href="opera">opera</a> by the opera program of the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign">University of Illinois</a>. The opera was composed by Stephen A. Taylor; the <a href="libretto">libretto</a> has been attributed both to <a href="Kate%20Gale">Kate Gale</a>, and to Marcia Johnson. Adapted in 2005, the opera premiered in 2012. Le Guin described the effort as a "beautiful opera" in an interview, and expressed hopes that it would be picked up by other producers. She also said she was better pleased with stage adaptations, including "Paradises Lost", than screen adaptations of her work till date. An essay written for the <a href="Poetry%20Foundation">Poetry Foundation</a> stated that the opera was "so free from history—and even from Earth—as to have its own constraints". The review described the opera as taking place in a quiet setting, unlike the "swashbuckling atmosphere" of most operas, and that as a result it depended more on atmosphere and language to maintain tension. A review of a performance that included excerpts of the opera in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, stated that Taylor had given the music "rhythmic drive and bright sound, with two sopranos, flute, <a href="celesta">celesta</a>, <a href="metallophone">metallophone</a> and plenty of <a href="pizzicato">pizzicato</a>, that were well suited to the theme of celestial travel." The review went on to say that the vocal melodies soon "took on a sense of sameness that undercut the story’s dramatic tension."

A review of the "Birthday of the World" volume in "<a href="Booklist">Booklist Review</a>" commented that it offered a "change of pace" from the rest of the collection, and that in contrast to many of the other stories, which are set in the Hainish Universe, it "stood well on its own". Suzy Hansen, writing in "Salon", said that the novella allowed the reader to imagine the process of designing a part of the world. Hansen went on to say that "Paradises Lost" allowed "reality architects" to ponder questions such as how to form language, and what environmental constraints shaped human beings. Hansen described the relationship between Hsing and Luis as a "wonderful love story", and also praised the characterization of Bliss as a "remarkable twist on organized religion", saying that the "conflict [made] logical sense". Writing in 2015, Haiven called "Paradises Lost" a "telling narrative" and described it as a "grim and timely warning" about religious fundamentalism, and its power to shape society. He compared the struggle of the protagonists to that of the anarchist society of "<a href="The%20Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>", and went on to say it was a "a chastening lesson in both the potential and the perils of freedom, [and] the secret life of authority".

Author and literary critic <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a>, reviewing the volume for New York Books, wrote that "Paradises Lost" was a part of the "note of renewal" in "Birthday of the World". Atwood stated that she found a "release from claustrophobia" in the fact that Le Guin offered a choice between a version of "heaven" on board the ship and life on a "dirtball", but took the side of the dirtball. According to Atwood, in doing so, "Paradises Lost" "shows us our own natural world as a freshly discovered Paradise Regained, a realm of wonder". The novella and the collection end with Hsing and Luis dancing in celebration of "the ordinary dirt that sustains them after they have left the ship," an ending Atwood praised as "minimalist." A review in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" was more critical, saying that while the story had many "sharp observations and lovely moments", the cult of Bliss did not "possess any imaginative reality". It commented: "Too tidily categorical, the story undermines only its own straw men."

A review of "The Found and the Lost" in "<a href="Locus%20%28magazine%29">Locus</a>" magazine stated that the novella was a "deft" example of the "classic "power chord"" of stories set on generation ships. The review compared the tone and premise of the story with that of science fiction authors <a href="Gene%20Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a> and <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>, and said that, as with Le Guin's other works, it explored multiple forms of <a href="social%20stratification">social stratification</a>. The collection as a whole received high praise, particularly for the "sheer level of talent and word-wizardry and world-building" in Le Guin's writing, and for taking a "non-dogmatic and fair-minded" approach to politically sensitive subjects. Attebery also suggested "Paradises Lost" had similarities with the quartet "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20the%20Long%20Sun">The Book of the Long Sun</a>" by Gene Wolfe in its discussion of religion, as well as with the writing of novelist Molly Gloss.

Attebery credited Le Guin, among others, of reviving generation ship stories in the 1990s, but wrote that their authors shifted the emphasis of such stories away from individuals towards exploring communal action and belief. Le Guin wished to focus on the "middle generations" in such stories; those generations that lived out their journey in isolation. According to Attebery, Le Guin was able to explore these lives because authors before her had written of the beginning and ending of generation ship journeys. A review of "The Found and the Lost" in the online science fiction magazine "<a href="Tor.com">Tor.com</a>" compared "Paradises Lost" and "<a href="Vaster%20than%20Empires%20and%20More%20Slow">Vaster than Empires and More Slow</a>", stating that while both stories examined the challenges of interstellar travel and the isolation it brought on, the differences between them were "as stark as they are fascinating". It went on to say that "Paradises Lost" explored the issue of isolation in space travel with "compassion and patience", and called the story the "culmination of the collection, [which drew] together the community-building and existential malaise of all the previous stories into a captivating and ambivalent conclusion". Speaking of the volume as a whole, "Tor.com" stated that it readers home to places they've never visited, and making the familiar stranger and stranger still".

Loev

Loev (pronounced "love") is a 2015 Indian <a href="romance%20film">romantic</a> <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> written and directed by <a href="Sudhanshu%20Saria">Sudhanshu Saria</a>. Produced by Saria and Bombay Berlin Film Productions, the film stars Dhruv Ganesh and <a href="Shiv%20Pandit">Shiv Pandit</a> as two friends who set off to the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a> for a weekend trip and focuses on their complex emotional and sexual relationship. It was Ganesh's final film role as he died from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> prior to the production's release. "Loev" also features <a href="Siddharth%20Menon%20%28actor%29">Siddharth Menon</a> and Rishabh Chaddha in supporting roles. The film's title is a <a href="Sensational%20spelling">deliberate misspelling</a> of the word "love".

Saria wrote "Loev" script while he was working on the draft of the unreleased film "I Am Here" and drew heavily from his personal experiences. It was eventually picked up for production by <a href="Arfi%20Lamba">Arfi Lamba</a> and Katherine Suckale despite Saria's own doubts on its viability. Principal photography took place at <a href="Mahabaleshwar">Mahabaleshwar</a>, in the Western Ghats in peninsular India, and at <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. The film was shot in the summer of 2014, over the course of 16 days by the cinematographer Sherri Kauk in <a href="2K%20resolution">2K resolution</a>. It relied on <a href="crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> and cost-cutting measures; its budget was relatively low at $1 million.

"Loev" had its world premiere at the 2015 <a href="Tallinn%20Black%20Nights%20Film%20Festival">Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival</a> in Estonia. It had its North American premiere at the 2016 <a href="South%20By%20Southwest">South By Southwest</a> Film Festival and premiered in India at the 2016 <a href="Mumbai%20Film%20Festival">Mumbai International Film Festival</a>, and was well received by the critics and audience alike. Particular praise was given for the script as well as the performances of Pandit and Ganesh. Commentators were also appreciative of the unconventional and fresh treatment of <a href="Homosexuality%20in%20India">same-sex relationships in India</a>. The film won the Audience Award for Best Feature Film at the 2016 <a href="TLVFest">Tel Aviv International Film Festival</a>. "Loev" was released on <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> on 1 May 2017.

Sahil (Ganesh), a young Mumbai-based musician, plans a weekend getaway to the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a> with his childhood friend, Jai (Pandit), a successful New York-based businessman. The trip coincides with the latter's business meeting in Mumbai. The duo drive to <a href="Mahabaleshwar">Mahabaleshwar</a> overnight and upon arrival decide to visit the local market. While at a <a href="music%20store">music store</a>, Jai is impressed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist and suggests that he pursue a career as a full-time musician.

Throughout their trip, they argue about their past failure to maintain a relationship. Sahil is irked by Jai's increasingly indifferent behaviour and his workaholic nature. Jai, on the other hand, is disgruntled with Sahil's continuous complaints. One night, Jai makes a pass at Sahil, who is initially hesitant but eventually responds to his advances. The next morning, the two visit the Ghats as Sahil had intended. Sahil takes Jai to an overhanging cliff, with a scenic view of Mahabaleshwar. They later return to a hotel in Mumbai for Jai's scheduled business meeting. At the hotel room, the two admit to their mutual attraction, just before Jai has to leave for his meeting. Sahil interrupts the meeting and embarrasses the businessman with a romantic gesture witnessed by everyone present. This leads to a confrontation between the two back in the hotel room, during which Sahil accuses Jai of being scared of <a href="coming%20out">coming out</a>. Jai counters by blaming Sahil for not reciprocating his affection from the beginning. The two kiss, but when Sahil tries to pull away, Jai rapes him, only to immediately regret it. Jai apologises and tells Sahil that he need not stay any longer if he doesn't want to. Sahil stays, but refrains from conversing with Jai.

As planned, the two meet Alex (Menon), Sahil's boyfriend, who is accompanied by a friend, Junior (Chaddha). The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an argument between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four head back to the hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to return to New York later that night. Alex notices the guitar and insists that Sahil play for him; Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks at Sahil mainly. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do not talk about the rape.

At the airport, Jai asks Sahil to leave. He rejects Sahil's efforts at reconciliation, and tells the musician that they can never be together because they have vastly different lives. When they eventually part ways, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries to make up for his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.


"Loev"s script was written by <a href="Sudhanshu%20Saria">Sudhanshu Saria</a> in the United States, when he was working on the screenplay of another film, "I Am Here". Describing the film as "small, fragile, honest", Saria said that through his endeavours he "tries to capture the silences and the things unsaid in male friendships". He began working on "Loev" because he was unable to manage funds for "I Am Here". At the time of the script's inception, Saria had no plan of making it into a <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a>, as he believed that no investors or actors would want to be associated with a film that he thought would be censored or banned in its home country. The narrative of the production, which is set in Saria's hometown, Mumbai, follows many personal experiences that he himself went through, growing up in the Indian hill town of <a href="Darjeeling">Darjeeling</a>, and later at the <a href="Ithaca%20College">Ithaca Arts College</a>, New York. The dialogue was written in <a href="Hinglish">Hinglish</a>, a macaronic hybrid use of English and <a href="Languages%20of%20South%20Asia">South Asian languages</a>.

Pre-production work for the film began in February 2014, when Katharina Suckale, Jasleen Marwah, and <a href="Arfi%20Lamba">Arfi Lamba</a> of the Bombay Berlin Film Production showed interest in adapting the script into a full-length feature film. Saria said that the screenplay was written out of "deep shame and fear" and on completion was not pitched to any investors, but instead put away into a drawer. The script was picked up by Suckale and Lamba, who agreed to co-produce Saria's directorial debut. The film's title is a <a href="Sensational%20spelling">deliberate misspelling</a> of the word "love", though the two are <a href="pronunciation">pronounced</a> identically and are essentially <a href="synonym">synonym</a>s. The misspelling was explained by Saria in an interview with "<a href="Gaylaxy">Gaylaxy</a>": "no matter how different love may look like compared to convention, i.e. no matter how it is spelt, it is still love". The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20India">Supreme Court of India</a>'s December 2013 decision to reinstate <a href="Section%20377%20of%20the%20Indian%20Penal%20Code">Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code</a>, which criminalised same-sex relationships in India had a major bearing on Saria's work. In the film's official release statement Saria talked about the environment that he worked in saying that, "it was in this India [referring to the Supreme Court judgement] that our actors, technicians, investors and supporters came together to make this film, working in absolute secrecy".

The film stars <a href="Shiv%20Pandit">Shiv Pandit</a> and Dhruv Ganesh; the former came across the film's script during a casual meeting with Saria. In an interview with "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>", Pandit discussed the meeting between him and Saria, saying, "he had no desire to cast me, [...] because he thought I do only commercial films. I had to force it out of him. But when I heard it I found it interesting and we decided to do it". Saria called Ganesh for the table read for the protagonist of the film, Sahil, and was greatly impressed by his approach to the character. Ganesh was apprehensive about playing the character, but after initial scepticism he agreed to play the role. Siddharth Menon and Rishabh J. Chaddha play supporting roles in the film. "Loev" marked the last film role for Ganesh, as he died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in January 2015, while the film was in post-production. The opening credits in the film's final cut honour his memory.

Principal photography began in the summer of 2014 and took place entirely in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and <a href="Mahabaleshwar">Mahabaleshwar</a>, a small hilltown in the <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage">UNESCO World Heritage</a> site of the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a>, in peninsular India. <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> alumnus Sherri Kauk served as the <a href="director%20of%20photography">director of photography</a> for the film. "Loev" was filmed in a single schedule in a short span of 16 days. Saria said, "We had to plan well, be extremely frugal, count every penny and make sure it all ended up on the screen."

With a modest budget of 1 million, the production of "Loev" was funded partly by the production partners, and by <a href="private%20equity">private equity</a>. A <a href="crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> campaign was started on the funding portal <a href="Indiegogo">Indiegogo</a>, raising an amount of approximately 4,000. In an interview with Manoj Sharma of Pandolin, a digital film magazine, Lamba talked about the struggle of funding the project saying that the investors backed out at the last-minute at more than one occasion. The film's crew members financed the project from their own salaries to meet the cost of production.

The filming was done discreetly as Saria feared opposition from the local community towards the film's underlying subject of homosexuality. Among the crew members, only a core group were aware of the details of the plot, and to the rest of the crew it was a <a href="road%20movie">road trip film</a>, one identical to "<a href="Dil%20Chahta%20Hai">Dil Chahta Hai</a>" (2001). During the filming of a scene where Pandit kisses Ganesh in the outdoors, the crew members were taken aback as most of them were unaware of any romantic involvement between the two characters. Pandit found the rape scene difficult to shoot, because of the emotional weight that it carried: "What I did to overcome my revulsion was to not stand judgment over my character Jai's action. I just went with how Jai reacted to the given situation."

The <a href="film%20editing">film editing</a> process began in June 2015; the team of editors was headed by Nitesh Bhatia, and Pritam Das was the sound mixer. Sweta Gupta was the film's <a href="art%20director">art director</a>, and the costumes were by Rohit Chaturvedi. <a href="Neha%20Kakkar%23Personal%20life">Tony Kakkar</a> provided the soundtrack for the film. An original track recorded by Kakkar, entitled "Ek Chaand", was released as part of the official soundtrack for the film. It was released on 4 May 2017, under the label of Desi Music Factory on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>. A two-and-a-half-minute preview of the song was released on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> in the same month.

"Loev"s entire editing and sound mixing process was completed on 25 November, after four months of post-production work. With a total runtime of 92 minutes, the film was pitched under the labels of Bombay Berlin Film Productions and Four Line Films.
Its foreign distribution rights were acquired by Loic Magneron's Wide Management, a Paris-based sales-production-distribution house. The deal was finalised after a meeting between Magneron and Saria at the film's Tallinn premiere. However, the distribution rights were withdrawn when the producers entered into negotiations with <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a>. The worldwide rights of the film were acquired by Netflix in April 2017.

The themes of unrequited love and self-acceptance are central to "Loev" as noted by such commentators as Aseem Chhabra, Zack Ford, and <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a>. They wrote in their reviews that the theme of sexuality takes a backseat to the aforementioned subjects. Chhabra, a New York-based film writer and director noted that the film beautifully presented an emotional journey of gay characters, who seemed to be comfortable with their identity. Also, as expressed by Saria himself, the film was intended as a "universal story about attraction". He did not want to conform to a single definition for the film or the relationship between two lead characters.

While "<a href="Vox%20%28magazine%29">Vox</a>"s Siddharth Naidu thought of the film as politically radical and emotionally raw, Chhabra called it the least bit political in another editorial for <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a>. This view was shared by the freelance journalist Steven Borowiec, who wrote that the social context of same-sex relationships in India remained "mostly off-screen". Writing for "<a href="ThinkProgress">ThinkProgress</a>" Ford also noted that although the socio-political backdrop, "is never explicitly mentioned, it's alluded to throughout". Addressing the same issue, Saria said that "Loev" is not a political film, but the act of making it was a political one. He said, "[W]hat started out as an intellectual act of protest quickly became something else. Love." Jha believed that it marked "a new beginning for cinema on unconstitutional love in India".

While working in the United States, Saria familiarised himself with <a href="Independent%20film">independent</a> <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">American cinema</a>, which greatly influenced his work. He also listed such directors as the <a href="Dardenne%20brothers">Dardenne brothers</a>, <a href="%C3%89ric%20Rohmer">Éric Rohmer</a>and <a href="Hrishikesh%20Mukherjee">Hrishikesh Mukherjee</a> as influential during his formative years as a filmmaker. Critics and commentators drew parallels between "Loev" and <a href="Ang%20Lee">Ang Lee</a>'s "<a href="Brokeback%20Mountain%20%28film%29">Brokeback Mountain</a>" (2005). Jha observed the palpable similarity "in the way the rocky terrain is used to define the theme of forbidden love". The film was also thought to be visually and structurally similar to <a href="Andrew%20Haigh">Andrew Haigh</a>'s "<a href="Weekend%20%282011%20film%29">Weekend</a>" (2011), and <a href="Wong%20Kar-wai">Wong Kar-wai</a>'s "<a href="Happy%20Together%20%281997%20film%29">Happy Together</a>" (1997). Ford thought that despite being a lot more subtle in its portrayal of same-sex affection in comparison to "Weekend"), "Loev" was still "quite novel for Bollywood".

"Loev" premiered at the <a href="Tallinn%20Black%20Nights%20Film%20Festival">Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival</a>, Estonia on 19 November 2015. The film was then screened at various other film festivals across Europe and Asia, including the <a href="Jeonju%20International%20Film%20Festival">Jeonju International Film Festival</a>, South Korea; the <a href="Istanbul%20International%20Film%20Festival">Istanbul International Film Festival</a>, Turkey; the <a href="Art%20Film%20Fest">Art Film Fest</a>ival, Slovakia; and the <a href="Transilvania%20International%20Film%20Festival">Transilvania International Film Festival</a>, Romania. It had its North American premiere on 12 March, for the "Visions" section at the 2016 <a href="South%20By%20Southwest">South By SouthWest Film Festival</a>. The <a href="TLVFest">Tel Aviv International LGBT Film Festival</a>, the , and the <a href="Frameline%20Film%20Festival">Frameline Film Festival</a> were among the LGBTQ film festivals that featured the production. The film won the Audience Award for Best Feature Film at the 2016 <a href="TLVFest">Tel Aviv International Film Festival</a>.

Upon release in India at the "India Gold" segment of the 2016 <a href="Mumbai%20Film%20Festival">Mumbai Film Festival</a>, "Loev" garnered positive response from critics. It was also screened at the 2016 <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20of%20Kerala">International Film Festival of Kerala</a>, <a href="Thiruvananthapuram">Thiruvananthapuram</a>. "Loev" was released on <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> on 1 May 2017. A new poster was unveiled for the film's Netflix release. Designed by an Indian-based designing house, Pigeon & Co, it featured the two lead actors. Shortly after the film's release, <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> hosted Saria on a talk show on CNN-News18 and organised a roundtable discussion for the lead actors, Saria, and the film's producers. In May 2017, the film had a special screening in Mumbai, which was attended by the entire cast and crew along with Bollywood personalities such as <a href="Richa%20Chaddha">Richa Chaddha</a>, <a href="Kalki%20Koechlin">Kalki Koechlin</a>, Rannvijay Singh, <a href="Bejoy%20Nambiar">Bejoy Nambiar</a>, <a href="Shruti%20Seth">Shruti Seth</a>, and <a href="Meiyang%20Chang">Meiyang Chang</a> among others.

"Loev" received positive response from critics at the Mumbai Film Festival; Manika Verma from the <a href="Mumbai%20Film%20Festival%23MAMI">MAMI Young Critics Lab</a> gave a largely positive review calling the film a "breather", and stating that it "doesn't pander and conform to the stereotypes, a trap very easy to fall into." The view was shared by <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", who wrote that the film added a new dimension to gay cinema; she thought that the endeavour was "a deceptively simple yet nuanced and heartfelt take on the eternal relationship conundrum." Subhash K. Jha gave the film four stars out of five, defining it not as a gay film but an "unforgettable love story". Applauding the cinematography, direction, and the performances from Ganesh and Pandit, he described the film as one that not only "redefines love and passion in the context of the Indian reality, it is a new beginning for cinema on unconstitutional love in India." Deepali Singh also praised the film in her review for "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>", with particular emphasis on the cinematography and Ganesh's performance. She thought that there were several memorable scenes in the film. Praising the chemistry of the leading cast, Joshi said that Pandit was "all solidity and strength", and Ganesh "tenderness and vulnerability".

"Loev" garnered praise from critics at many film festivals; commentators were largely laudatory of both the film's sensitive treatment of the theme of homosexuality and the performances of the cast. Reviewing the film at <a href="Tallinn%20Black%20Nights%20Film%20Festival">Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival</a>, Shelagh Rowan-Legg of "<a href="Screen%20Anarchy">Screen Anarchy</a>" praised the refreshing concept of the film, different from the usual cinema associated with India: ""Loev" examines the personal and the political, [...] in a sensitive yet open portrait of love and sexuality." Rowan-Legg further called the cast "tailor-made", lauding Pandit in particular, saying, "Pandit perfectly times the slow release of his frustration, [...] is both appalling and believable." Although finding Ganesh to be "a charismatic presence on screen", "<a href="Screen%20International">Screen International</a>"s Wendy Ide —otherwise impressed with the cast's performances— stated, "naturalistic acting style notwithstanding, there is something not entirely persuasive about the relationship between Jai and Sahil."

"Loev" was well received in North America. Its screening was the first time an Indian film was shown at the <a href="South%20by%20Southwest%20Film%20Festival">South by Southwest Film Festival</a>; Brooke Corso of "The Macguffin" remarked that the beautiful and heartbreaking film shines when "it focuses on what is said when the characters aren't speaking, and what is avoided when they do." Matt Shiverdecker of "<a href="Austin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BAmerican-Statesman">Austin American-Statesman</a>" was largely laudatory of the production at the same event as well, dubbing it as a "small miracle". He praised the film's realism, and attributed its success to the actors and to the beautiful scenery. Siddhant Adlakha of Birth Movies Death called "Loev" a "minuscule film of miraculous construction" and "a melancholy tale where questions have no easy answers, [...] but one where bliss, even momentary, feels infinite."

Porlock Stone Circle

Porlock Stone Circle is a <a href="stone%20circles%20in%20the%20British%20Isles%20and%20Brittany">stone circle</a> located on <a href="Exmoor">Exmoor</a>, near the village of <a href="Porlock">Porlock</a> in the <a href="Southwest%20England">south-western</a> <a href="England">English</a> county of <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>. The Porlock ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> during the <a href="Neolithic%20British%20Isles">Late Neolithic</a> and <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Early Bronze Age</a>, over a period between 3,300 and 900 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> entities for the circles' builders.

Although Exmoor witnessed the construction of many monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being <a href="Withypool%20Stone%20Circle">Withypool Stone Circle</a>. The Porlock circle is about in diameter and contains thirteen <a href="Mica">green micaceous</a> sandstone rocks; there may originally have been more. Directly to the north-east of the circle is a <a href="cairn">cairn</a> apparently connected to a linear stone row. No evidence has been found that allows for <a href="absolute%20dating">absolute dating</a> of the monument's construction, although archaeologists have suggested that the cairn dates from the Early Bronze Age, the circle being a Middle Bronze Age addition.

A small lead wheel found inside Porlock Stone Circle suggests that the site was visited during the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Romano-British</a> period. The site was rediscovered in the 1920s and since then a variety of stones have been added to it; its current appearance is a composite of prehistoric and modern elements. In 1928 the site was surveyed and <a href="excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavated</a> by the archaeologist <a href="Harold%20St%20George%20Gray">Harold St George Gray</a>. A second excavation took place under the leadership of Mark Gillings in 2013.

The circle is located two and three-quarter miles south-west of the village of <a href="Porlock">Porlock</a>, in the south-western English county of <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>. It is one mile south of the <a href="A39%20road">A39</a> road and is immediately to the west of the lane headed south to <a href="Exford%2C%20Somerset">Exford</a>. The ring is at an altitude of almost above sea level, and is positioned 10 kilometres (six and a half miles) north of the <a href="Withypool%20Stone%20Circle">Withypool Stone Circle</a>.

The land on which the circle is located slopes from the north-east to the south-west. From the circle, a range of different <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Bronze Age</a> <a href="round%20barrow">round barrow</a>s, or <a href="tumulus">tumuli</a>, are visible at different points in the surrounding landscape. Among the nearest are <a href="Alderman%27s%20Barrow">Alderman's Barrow</a>, <a href="Black%20Barrow">Black Barrow</a>, the two <a href="Bendels%20Barrows">Bendels Barrows</a>, the <a href="Rowbarrows">Rowbarrows</a>, and the <a href="Kit%20Barrows">Kit Barrows</a>. On the east-northeast side of the circle is the <a href="Berry%20Castle%2C%20Somerset">Berry Castle</a> earthwork camp, which dates from the <a href="Iron%20Age%20Britain">Late Iron Age</a> or <a href="Roman%20Britain">Romano-British</a> period.

While the transition from the <a href="Neolithic">Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic</a> in the fourth and third millennia BCE saw much economic and technological continuity, there was a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England. By 3000 BCE, the <a href="long%20barrow">long barrow</a>s, <a href="causewayed%20enclosure">causewayed enclosure</a>s, and <a href="cursus">cursus</a>es which had predominated in the Early Neolithic were no longer built, and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen <a href="henge">henge</a>s, <a href="timber%20circles">timber circles</a>, and stone circles. Stone circles are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner. They are most densely concentrated in south-western England and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE.

These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, but may have been deliberately left as "silent and empty monuments". The archaeologist <a href="Mike%20Parker%20Pearson">Mike Parker Pearson</a> suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead, and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.

There are only two known prehistoric stone circles on Exmoor: Porlock and <a href="Withypool%20Stone%20Circle">Withypool Stone Circle</a>. The archaeologist <a href="Leslie%20Grinsell">Leslie Grinsell</a> suggested that the circular stone monument on <a href="Almsworthy%20Common">Almsworthy Common</a> was "probably" the remains of a stone circle, although more recent assessments regard it one of the <a href="Stone%20settings%20%28Exmoor%29">stone settings</a>, a different form of monument that is more common across Exmoor.

Archaeologists have dated these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and have noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, on <a href="Dartmoor">Dartmoor</a>. In contrast to the two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural <a href="granite">granite</a>. Instead it has <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> slates and <a href="Exmoor%20Group%23Hangman%20Sandstone%20Formation">Hangman Grits</a>, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.

This scarcity of large stones may explain why Neolithic and Bronze Age communities used small stones, termed "miniliths", in the two Exmoor circles and in other monuments within the region. There are nevertheless other constructions in the area, such as the <a href="clapper%20bridge">clapper bridge</a> at <a href="Tarr%20Steps">Tarr Steps</a> and the three-metre Long Stone at <a href="Challacombe">Challacombe</a>, which do use locally sourced large megaliths. This suggests that larger stones would have been available had the sites' builders desired, and that the use of miniliths was therefore deliberate.

Exmoor also has a henge, near <a href="Parracombe">Parracombe</a>, although it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, <a href="Menhir">standing stones</a>, <a href="Stone%20row">linear stone rows</a>, and stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might also explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here. Most of the surviving prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason it is likely that the surviving sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites.

Porlock Stone Circle has a diameter of and a circumference of approximately . The stones in the circle are <a href="Mica">green micaceous</a> sandstone originating from the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> period, and were probably collected in the local area. Following his excavation of several stone settings, the archaeologist Mark Gillings argued that three forms of stone were deliberately incorporated into the circle: small uprights, low uprights, and larger stones that are positioned in a sloping position. Most of the latter were thin wedges that had been deliberately selected for their shape or flaked to give them a tapering form. Commenting on those cases where the majority of the stone is below ground rather than protruding from it, Gillings suggested that such a positioning may reflect a "deliberate inversion of the upright stone ideal". This concept of inversion is also evident at contemporary sites like <a href="Seahenge">Holme timber circle</a> in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> and, according to Gillings, might reflect "a strong <a href="chthonic">chthonic</a> element" to Porlock Stone Circle.

Investigation in the 1920s found ten upright stones and eleven prostrate ones, and concluded that there would have probably been about forty-three stones in the circle, each spaced about apart. The largest gaps in the circle were on its north-west and east-southeast sides, where the stones may have been removed for use as <a href="road%20metal">road metal</a>. In 1950, it was noted that some of the stones had since been disrupted by military training during the Second World War. When the site was surveyed in 1989, thirteen stones remained in the circle, several of which were found to be in different locations to the 1920s. A 2009 survey by the <a href="Exmoor%20National%20Park%20Authority">Exmoor National Park Authority</a> found only ten. A fuller archaeological investigation in 2013 revealed eleven upright stones and eight fallen. Gillings noted that as it exists in the twenty-first century, the circle is "clearly an amalgamation of prehistoric and wholly modern standing stones".

Directly adjacent to the north-east of the circle is a <a href="cairn">cairn</a> which has been denuded, many of its stones being removed. There is a linear setting of small stones to the southeast of the circle's edge. First recorded in 1975, at the time the row contained eight stones, six of them upright, covering a length of . The stones were mostly very small and barely visible in the turf, and were spaced at around intervals. In 2012, a burn of the heather revealed that there were five more stones on the southeastern end of the row, indicating a total distance of . The relationship between this stone row and the stone circle is unclear because road construction and quarrying has taken place in the area between the two. The trajectory of the stone row would pass through the cairn adjacent to the circle.

Gillings argued that the stone row and cairn were part of a wider monumental landscape incorporating Porlock Stone Circle. He suggested that the cairn was built in the Early Bronze Age, with additions of a rough paving around its perimeter made in the Middle Bronze Age. He also put forward the possibility that the stone circle was built during the Middle Bronze Age as part of a wider "re-organisation of the landscape" around the cairn.

During the 2013 excavation, a four-spoked lead wheel measuring in diameter was found buried in the circle. Although it could not be unequivocally identified, it resembled Late Iron Age and early Roman votive items that are sometimes found in Britain and (more commonly) <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>. If this identification is correct, it would suggest that Porlock Stone Circle was known about and visited during the Romano-British period.

The circle was rediscovered in the early 20th century by E. T. MacDermot, a man who lived in the Lillycombe estate near Porlock. He knew of several stones on Porlock Common but only noticed the wider circle after the heather was burnt away. MacDermot was aware that the archaeologist <a href="Harold%20St%20George%20Gray">Harold St George Gray</a> had investigated Exmoor's Withypool Stone Circle in 1905, and informed him of the discovery. In September and October 1928, Gray surveyed the Porlock circle with the permission of the landowner. He also briefly <a href="excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavated</a> a small area in the centre of the circle, where a dozen slabs of stone were revealed but no <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>.

In August 2009 a <a href="resistivity">resistivity</a> survey of the site was carried out by Gillings and fellow archaeologist Jeremy Taylor, both of the <a href="University%20of%20Leicester">University of Leicester</a>. They did so at the behest of the <a href="Exmoor%20National%20Park%20Authority">Exmoor National Park Authority</a>, which commissioned the research as part of their Monument Management Scheme. This survey indicated that there had been sub-rectangular structures situated around the circle at some point in the past, although Gillings and Taylor acknowledged that excavation would be required to determine at what period these existed. Gillings oversaw this excavation in 2013. His team opened a <a href="Trench%23Archaeology">trench</a> measuring around the circle's northern arc. No artefacts from the period of original construction were revealed, nor were any sealed, undisturbed deposits suitable for <a href="Environmental%20archaeology">environmental sampling</a> and <a href="Chronological%20dating">dating</a>. A second trench was opened to examine stones located to the east of the circle, which Gillings's team believed had been part of the stone row.

The site has been scheduled as an <a href="ancient%20monument">ancient monument</a> under the <a href="Ancient%20Monuments%20and%20Archaeological%20Areas%20Act%201979">Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979</a>, giving it a level of legal protection from alteration. Surveys have shown a marked deterioration in its condition – in 1950 Gray could identify 21 stones as part of the circle, but by 2009 the survey on behalf of Exmoor National Park Authority found only 10. Stones have also been added to the circle in recent years, and heritage managers face the question as to whether they should be removed or accepted as part of the circle's on-going biography.

Withypool Stone Circle

Withypool Stone Circle, also known as Withypool Hill Stone Circle, is a <a href="stone%20circles%20in%20the%20British%20Isles%20and%20Brittany">stone circle</a> located on the <a href="Exmoor">Exmoor</a> <a href="moorland">moorland</a>, near the village of <a href="Withypool">Withypool</a> in the <a href="Southwest%20England">southwestern English</a> county of <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>. The ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> during the <a href="Neolithic%20British%20Isles">Late Neolithic</a> and Early <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Bronze Age</a>, over a period between 3300 and 900 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> entities for the circle's builders.

Many monuments were built in Exmoor during the Bronze Age, but only two stone circles survive in this area: the other is <a href="Porlock%20Stone%20Circle">Porlock Stone Circle</a>. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of <a href="heathland">heathland</a>. It is about 36.4 metres (119 feet 5 inches) in diameter. Around thirty small <a href="gritstone">gritstone</a>s remain, although there may originally have been around 100; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and surveyed by the archaeologist <a href="Harold%20St%20George%20Gray">Harold St George Gray</a> in 1905.

Withypool Stone Circle is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill; some sources refer to it as Withypool Hill Stone Circle. The site is 381 metres (1250 feet) above sea level. It is 670 metres (733 yards) east of Portford Bridge, and 4.4 kilometres (2.75 miles) south/south-west of <a href="Exford%2C%20Somerset">Exford</a>.

The site slopes down from east to west. The <a href="topsoil">topsoil</a> is <a href="peaty">peaty</a> with <a href="Ericaceae">heather</a>. A range of different <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Bronze Age</a> <a href="round%20barrow">round barrow</a>s, a type of <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a>, are visible at different points in the surrounding landscape. There is a lone tumulus 262 metres (286 yards) to the north-east of the circle, on the summit of Withypool Hill, although this is so eroded that it can no longer be seen from Withypool Stone Circle itself. The three <a href="Brightworthy%20Barrows">Brightworthy Barrows</a> can be seen from the circle in a north-west direction. Other Bronze Age barrows visible from the circle are the <a href="Green%20Barrow">Green Barrow</a>, the <a href="Old%20Barrow">Old Barrow</a>, the <a href="Twitchen%20Barrows">Twitchen Barrows</a>, the three <a href="Wam%20Barrows">Wam Barrows</a> of <a href="Winsford%20Hill">Winsford Hill</a>, and the barrow on top of <a href="Sherdon">Sherdon</a>.

Also visible from the circle is a scatter of over thirty stones on the Westwater Allotment; these are up to 0.5 m (1.6 feet) long and in 1988 two were reported as being standing. Elsewhere on Withypool Common is a collection of six stones arranged in a rough circle, which may have represented another stone circle or perhaps the kerbstones from a since-destroyed <a href="round%20cairn">round cairn</a>.

While the transition from the <a href="Neolithic">Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic</a> in the fourth and third millennia BCE saw much economic and technological continuity, there was a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England. By 3000 BCE, the <a href="long%20barrow">long barrow</a>s, <a href="causewayed%20enclosure">causewayed enclosure</a>s, and <a href="cursus">cursus</a>es which had predominated in the Early Neolithic were no longer built, and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.

Most of the surviving prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason it is likely that the surviving sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites.

The stone circle measures 36.4 metres (119 feet 6 inches) in diameter.
In 1905, there were 37 stones remaining in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring; the stones perhaps in these areas may have been removed for use as <a href="road%20metal">road metal</a>. There are ground depressions where some of these stones have been removed. In 1915 it was reported that one had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only 29 stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year the archaeologist <a href="Aubrey%20Burl">Aubrey Burl</a> reported 30 stones, of which three had fallen and 27 remained standing. Originally it may have included around 100 stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 3 inches) apart.

The stones themselves are small: on average they measure 10 cm (4 inches) in height, 30 cm (one foot) in width, and 10 cm (4 inches) in depth. The largest protrudes about 0.5 metres (1 foot 8 inches) from the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely have been broken since the original erection of the circle. It is not known if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, but a sample from one stone was examined and found to be a hard, pale grey <a href="gritstone">gritstone</a>, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.

The site was accidentally rediscovered in 1898 when Archibald Hamilton was riding across Withypool Heath. His horse stumbled on one of the stones, and on further investigation he located other stones within the <a href="bracken">bracken</a>. After the bracken on the heath was burned by farmers, Hamilton returned to pay closer attention to the circle. He contacted Colonel Bramble, the Vice President of the <a href="Somerset%20Archaeological%20and%20Natural%20History%20Society">Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society</a>, who put him in touch with the archaeologist <a href="Harold%20St%20George%20Gray">Harold St George Gray</a>. Gray accompanied Hamilton on a visit to the site in August 1905, when he made a complete survey of the ring.

Gray published his findings in a 1906 volume of the "Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society", in which he drew comparisons between the site and two Cornish stone circles that he had recently surveyed, <a href="Fernacre">Fernacre</a> and <a href="Stannon%20stone%20circle">Stannon Stone Circle</a>. He suggested that the circle had been the site of <a href="cremation">cremation</a>s, the cremated human remains then being buried within the nearby tumuli. In August 1915, Gray returned to the site. He noted that the circle was in largely the same condition as before, but that the <a href="Calluna">ling</a> and <a href="whortleberry">whortleberry</a> bushes around the site were more stunted than they had previously been. Between 1982 and 1985, Fowler visited Withypool Stone Circle alongside other prehistoric stone monuments in Exmoor for a catalogue published in a 1988 edition of the "Proceedings".

The site has been categorised as a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a> since 1925, and is thus accorded legal protection under the <a href="Ancient%20Monuments%20and%20Archaeological%20Areas%20Act%201979">Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979</a>. In the <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> database, it is given the listing number of 1021261.

1896 Cedar Keys hurricane

The 1896 Cedar Keys hurricane was a powerful and destructive <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that devastated much of the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a>, starting with <a href="Florida">Florida</a>'s <a href="Cedar%20Keys">Cedar Keys</a>, near the end of September 1896. The storm's rapid movement allowed it to maintain much of its intensity after <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> and cause significant damage over a broad area; as a result, it became one of the costliest United States hurricanes at the time. The fourth tropical cyclone of the <a href="1896%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1896 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, it formed by September 22, likely from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a>, before crossing the Caribbean Sea just south of the <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>. It entered the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> as the equivalent of a major hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20scale">Saffir–Simpson scale</a>, and struck the Cedar Keys—an offshore island chain that includes the island and city of Cedar Key—early on the morning of September 29 with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">winds</a> of 125 mph (205 km/h). The area was inundated by a devastating <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> that undermined buildings, washed out the connecting railroad to the mainland, and submerged the smaller, outlying islands, where 31 people were killed. Strong winds also destroyed many of the <a href="Juniperus%20virginiana">red cedar trees</a> that played an important role in the economy of the region.

The cyclone continued inland over the <a href="Suwannee%20River">Suwannee River</a> valley, causing widespread destruction in dozens of communities across interior northern Florida; in the hardest-hit settlements, intense winds left few trees or buildings standing. The hurricane razed of dense pine forests in northern Florida, crippling the <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a> industry. Crops and livestock were destroyed, and thousands of individuals were left homeless. The storm killed at least 70 people in mainland Florida, while inflicting approximately $3 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in property damage across the state. Speeding north, the hurricane ravaged southeastern Georgia and the <a href="Sea%20Islands">Sea Islands</a>. In <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a>, a 45-minute onslaught of fierce winds unroofed thousands of structures. Parks, cemeteries, and streets in the city were littered with fallen trees, and the <a href="Savannah%20River">Savannah River</a> saw dozens of wrecked boats. At least 37 people in Georgia lost their lives. Strong winds and high tides battered southeastern <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, ruining rice crops and peeling off roofs. The storm then tracked through mostly rural sectors of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> and did significant wind damage in the <a href="Research%20Triangle">Raleigh–Durham</a> area.

Although the hurricane was weakening and transitioning into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> late on September 29, its rapid forward movement contributed to high wind velocities across parts of the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a>, with gusts approaching . Additionally, torrential rains fell west of the storm's track. In <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, cities and agricultural districts alike suffered extensive damage. Flash flooding in the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> culminated in the failure of an <a href="earthen%20dam">earthen dam</a> upstream from <a href="Staunton%2C%20Virginia">Staunton</a>, unleashing a torrent of water that swept homes from their foundations and ravaged the town's commerce district. In <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, thousands of trees were uprooted or snapped, communications were severed, and localized streaks of violent gusts damaged many public and private buildings. The <a href="White%20House">White House</a> grounds were left in disarray. High tides in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> triggered flooding in coastal cities. In <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, flooding rains and powerful wind gusts produced widespread destruction. Railroads in western parts of the state were plagued by washouts and landslides, while in southeastern areas, hundreds of barns were destroyed. The storm totally demolished a bridge over the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a>, while the <a href="Gettysburg%20Battlefield">Gettysburg Battlefield</a> lost hundreds of trees, a few of which struck and damaged historical monuments. Strong winds extended as far east as <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. Heavy rainfall reached west into <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, and the hurricane's extratropical remnants wrought havoc on shipping in the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. Along the storm's path, it caused at least 202 deaths and wrought more than $9.6 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage.

Although little is known about the system prior to its passage through the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a> as a tropical storm on September 22, it likely originated from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> that exited the western coast of Africa. Its track has been re-analyzed multiple times since the early 20th century. For several days, the storm moved westward through the northern Caribbean Sea, passing just south of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> as a low-end <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20scale">hurricane</a> on September 25. The cyclone steadily intensified, turned northward, and moved through the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Channel">Yucatán Channel</a> on September 28. The aftermath of the storm in western <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> was consistent with the effects of a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20scale">Saffir–Simpson scale</a>, suggesting that the storm was a major hurricane of Category 3 intensity while passing west of the island. As the storm entered the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, it began to accelerate and curve toward the north-northeast.

In the early morning on September 29, the center of the hurricane made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on <a href="Cedar%20Key%2C%20Florida">Cedar Key, Florida</a>, with a minimum central pressure of , and moved inland across <a href="Levy%20County%2C%20Florida">Levy County</a>. The cyclone possessed an unusually tight <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">core</a>, with a <a href="radius%20of%20maximum%20wind">radius of maximum wind</a>, and was traveling at a swift pace of about . Consequently, its estimated maximum winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) were higher than pressure alone would suggest. The small but intense hurricane continued northeastward through northern Florida and southeastern <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and its core contracted further; outside of a narrow corridor along the storm's track, winds were comparatively light. At <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>, air pressure fell 15 hPa (0.45 inHg) in 45 minutes as the storm center passed just to the west around midday on September 29. The system weakened as it sped northward through <a href="the%20Carolinas">the Carolinas</a>, but when it reached the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> on the evening of September 29, its increasingly rapid forward movement contributed to renewed wind violence. A band of heavy rain was observed along and west of the storm's track from northern <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> to southern <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, with the heaviest totals exceeding . As the storm transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> by early on September 30, its envelope of damaging winds expanded. The extratropical system passed west of <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and progressed into central Pennsylvania, dissipating near the <a href="Southern%20Tier">Southern Tier</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. Its remnants continued into the <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20Valley">St. Lawrence Valley</a>, where they merged with another <a href="low%20pressure%20area">low pressure area</a>.

As the hurricane passed to the south and then to the west of Cuba, strong winds and heavy rain showers were reported along the length of the island, beginning with <a href="Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a>. Winds reached hurricane force at <a href="Cape%20San%20Antonio%2C%20Cuba">Cape San Antonio</a>, the western tip of Cuba, and at <a href="Havana">Havana</a>. However, few details of the effects in Cuba are available.

The hurricane chiefly affected the eastern United States, impacting a broad region from Florida to New York over the course of just 24 hours. It was, at the time, one of the costliest hurricanes ever to strike the country.

Newspapers referred to the hurricane as the "worst ever known" in Florida. It caused at least $3 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in property damage throughout the state, and estimates of the number of individuals left homeless by the storm ran as high as 10,000 to 12,000.

While the hurricane was still in the Gulf of Mexico on September 28, the Norwegian <a href="barque">barque</a> "Saturn" foundered off <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a>. Her crew was rescued by a <a href="steamship">steamship</a> and brought to New York City. As the storm came ashore, the Cedar Keys were struck by a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> that victims often erroneously called a "tidal wave." <a href="Yankeetown%2C%20Florida">Yankeetown</a> received an even higher storm surge of . The main street through the center of Cedar Key—the most populous island in the Cedar Keys island chain—was severely flooded by of water, which invaded every building and left large <a href="sinkhole">sinkhole</a>s when it receded. Sidewalks along the street were washed out. The surge of water undermined the foundations of stone buildings, weakening many of them to the point of collapse, while sweeping away weaker structures. Inside the buildings left intact, mud was sometimes found several feet deep. The hurricane also contaminated wells with seawater and debris, so residents were forced to travel for clean water. Hardest-hit were the small outlying islands, which were fully submerged by the storm surge and "completely cleared out". Survivors often braced against young, supple trees that were able to withstand the storm's force, or used pieces of debris as flotation devices.

Powerful winds added to the destruction by damaging or leveling numerous churches and houses that managed to remain out of the flood's reach. The hurricane's cumulative force wrecked at least 100 homes on Cedar Key, and damaged or destroyed every building on nearby <a href="Atsena%20Otie%20Key">Atsena Otie Key</a>. A fire broke out during the storm and reduced two large Cedar Key hotels to mounds of <a href="coquina">coquina</a>. When the storm abated, streets were strewn with piles of debris, including trees, roofs, <a href="railroad%20tie">railroad tie</a>s, and boats. A large ship called the "Luna Davis" was tossed ashore and sat in the middle of Cedar Key's business district for weeks after the storm. Interests in shellfish harvesting took a significant blow, as the hurricane ruined oyster beds and carried most fishing boats out to sea. The stretch of the <a href="Florida%20Central%20and%20Peninsular%20Railroad">Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad</a> connecting Cedar Key to the mainland was completely washed out, leaving boats to transport people, mail, and supplies until the railway was rebuilt in mid-October.

The hurricane destroyed large swaths of red cedar trees ("<a href="Juniperus%20virginiana">Juniperus virginiana</a>") in the islands and along the adjacent coastline, although that resource had already been in decline due to unsustainable harvesting practices. Cedar wood from the area was prized for making high-quality pencils; some companies produced the pencils locally while others shipped processed cedar to their factories elsewhere. The <a href="Eagle%20Pencil%20Company">Eagle Pencil Company</a> mill on Cedar Key was destroyed. Across the channel on Atsena Otie Key, the <a href="Eberhard%20Faber">Eberhard Faber</a> mill lost 3,000 cases of cedar slats, as well as unprocessed timbers, at a loss of around $40,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Several other mills were destroyed. Damage to the Faber facility was repaired following the storm, but it closed just two years later due to a shortage of local cedar wood. Atsena Otie Key was abandoned a few years after the hurricane, largely attributable to the closure of the mill, which provided income for 100 households on the island.
In total, 31 people are known to have been killed by the hurricane in the Cedar Keys, mostly on the exposed outer islands; very few casualties were reported on Cedar Key itself. Immediately after the storm, there were unconfirmed reports that an entire fleet of <a href="sponge%20diving">sponge diving</a> boats sank near the Cedar Keys, leading to the deaths of some 700 men. Only a few bodies of sponge divers were recovered, and modern historians believe that most of the vessels actually rode out the storm in sheltered parts of the island chain. When news of the disaster in the Cedar Keys reached the mainland, many less damaged communities in Florida and Georgia formed relief groups to collect donations for storm victims. Answering pleas to "feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and provide shelter for the homeless," <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a> sent thousands of dollars in aid, while <a href="Albany%2C%20Georgia">Albany</a> residents donated of emergency supplies within days of the storm. <a href="Henry%20Flagler">Henry Flagler</a> pledged a donation of $1,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). By the end of October, the Jacksonville relief committee turned its focus to distributing goods and provisions instead of money, shipping hundreds of barrels of nails—highly sought-after for rebuilding efforts—to the hardest-hit areas.

The destruction of timber continued onto the mainland, prompting one observer to remark that no usable trees were left standing between the mouths of the <a href="Waccasassa%20River">Waccasassa</a> and <a href="Suwannee%20River">Suwannee</a> rivers. In <a href="Williston%2C%20Florida">Williston</a>, nearly a dozen residences were destroyed, killing at least one person and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town, and in total, about 13 people lost their lives in mainland Levy County. Damage throughout the county, including the Cedar Keys, was estimated at $450,000 (equivalent to $ million in ).

Along the coast about midway between <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a> and Cedar Key, eight people on a sailboat died when their vessel was driven aground. In Tampa, the storm flooded low-lying areas, wrecked a bridge over Spanishtown Creek, and crumbled sea walls. As the hurricane proceeded inland, it devastated interior parts of the state. Reports from the hardest-hit localities were slow to reach the outside world because of extensive damage to communications infrastructure, as well as obstructed or washed out railroads. Initial reports indicated that at least 20 communities were "wrecked" by the hurricane. In these areas, almost all stores and houses were demolished, particularly in western <a href="Alachua%20County%2C%20Florida">Alachua</a> and eastern <a href="Lafayette%20County%2C%20Florida">Lafayette</a> counties. Debris was often carried for miles. Farmers lost livestock, crops, and provisions needed for the winter, and hundreds of families were left homeless with little or no food. Along the Suwannee River, storm victims sought refuge in a makeshift shelter constructed from stray timbers. Extreme winds razed entire pine forests across numerous counties, initially uprooting weaker trees before shearing the rest off at their trunks during the height of the storm. By one estimate, the hurricane wiped out of timber across the state. This transformed the landscape and gave it a "prairie-like appearance". The <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a> industry was decimated, as the value of the lost pine timber was estimated at $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Additionally, <a href="still">still</a>s used to process turpentine were mangled. Consequently, some 2,500 turpentine workers were left unemployed. <a href="Phosphate">Phosphate</a> processing plants east of the Suwanee River also sustained $500,000 in damage (equivalent to $ million in ).
By several days after the hurricane, 12 people were reported dead across Alachua County. Five of them were in <a href="High%20Springs%2C%20Florida">High Springs</a>, including two seeking shelter in a <a href="box%20car">box car</a> that was blown off the tracks. Four turpentine workers in <a href="LaCrosse%2C%20Florida">LaCrosse</a> were crushed to death when a fallen tree landed on their cabin, and three others in the town were killed. In <a href="Newberry%2C%20Florida">Newberry</a>, which was "totally wrecked". three people died. About 20 homes and businesses in <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville</a> were ravaged, as were a sawmill, church, and warehouse. In <a href="Boulogne%2C%20Florida">Boulogne</a>, <a href="Nassau%20County%2C%20Florida">Nassau County</a>, five people were killed when a school building collapsed; four were crushed inside, and a baby was fatally struck by airborne timbers from the disintegrating structure. One child escaped the school but later died along with two others when her house collapsed. Another school collapse in <a href="Hilliard%2C%20Florida">Hilliard</a> took the lives of four individuals. Along the <a href="St.%20Marys%20River%20%28Florida%E2%80%93Georgia%29">St Marys River</a> in <a href="Kings%20Ferry%2C%20Florida">Kings Ferry</a>, strong winds drove two ships into a marsh, killing three sailors. Six others died nearby. One sawmill owner donated free lumber to Kings Ferry residents so they could rebuild their homes.

Several communities in <a href="Baker%20County%2C%20Florida">Baker County</a> were devastated, leaving seven people dead, as many as 100 injured, and hundreds destitute. The county sheriff estimated that merely a dozen houses out of a thousand survived the storm, that thousands of cows were killed, and that hundreds of thousands of trees were toppled. Not one church or school was left standing in the county, and damage there was estimated at $250,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Eight people were killed in <a href="Suwannee%20County%2C%20Florida">Suwannee County</a>, including two children crushed by the collapse of their home near <a href="Wellborn%2C%20Florida">Wellborn</a>. In Columbia County, dozens of buildings suffered near or total destruction, while nine people were killed. One woman lost her life in Grady, a small settlement in Lafayette County. Additionally, there were five fatalities in <a href="Bradford%20County%2C%20Florida">Bradford County</a>, including one man reportedly struck by flying bricks that were lofted nearly a half mile downwind. Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected areas as far southeast as <a href="St.%20Augustine%2C%20Florida">St. Augustine</a>. In <a href="Fernandina%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Fernandina Beach</a>, the hurricane toppled oak trees and destroyed buildings. Although wind gusts in Jacksonville reached , the effects were generally insignificant.

The hurricane still had considerable strength when it entered southeastern Georgia. The winds brought down telephone, telegraph, and electric wires throughout the region, severing communications. Damage in the <a href="Sea%20Islands">Sea Islands</a> was extensive, costing an estimated $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ); by some accounts, the winds were more intense than in the catastrophic <a href="1893%20Sea%20Islands%20hurricane">hurricane of 1893</a>, but without the exceptionally high <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>. The tropical cyclone caused severe damage to the islands' plantations, ruining around a third of the rice crop, devastating the cotton crop, and killing up to 100 people. <a href="Charlton%20County%2C%20Georgia">Charlton</a> and <a href="Camden%20County%2C%20Georgia">Camden</a> counties bore the brunt of the storm's force in Georgia, as evidenced by the complete clearing of dense pine forests east of <a href="Folkston%2C%20Georgia">Folkston</a>. This dealt a $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) blow to the turpentine industry. Many structures in Folkston were destroyed, including multiple churches, a courthouse, and a school that collapsed with 38 students inside, all of whom safely escaped. In small communities throughout extreme southeastern Georgia, the storm caused widespread destruction of homes and businesses. Six people in Camden County were killed, including four in a logging settlement that was ravaged near the Florida border.
In <a href="Brunswick%2C%20Georgia">Brunswick</a>, <a href="freight%20car">freight car</a>s in <a href="rail%20yard">rail yard</a>s were badly damaged, and railroads were clogged by fallen trees and utility poles. Estimates of property damage in Brunswick ran as high as $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ), while five people died and many more were injured by flying debris. Hurricane-force wind gusts lifted the roof off the <a href="Oglethorpe%20Hotel">Oglethorpe Hotel</a> and shattered its windows, while the L'Arioso Opera House, regarded as one of Brunswick's "most beautiful buildings", collapsed in the hurricane. At least six churches were severely damaged in the city, along with dozens of stores and residences. The hurricane sank numerous large vessels in the Brunswick harbor, including one loaded with of <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a>, and blew others aground. Observers reported the masts of submerged sailing ships protruding from the surface of the water. On <a href="St.%20Simons%2C%20Georgia">St. Simons Island</a>, the storm destroyed <a href="bath%20house">bath house</a>s, cottages, churches, and a pier, and inundated a hotel with sea water. <a href="African%20Americans">Black</a> settlements on the island suffered extensively. Overall, damage on St. Simons Island totaled $150,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). To the north, damage was similarly severe in <a href="Darien%2C%20Georgia">Darien</a>. Eight people there were reported dead and buildings were "torn to pieces."

Sustained winds in <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a> reached , though maximum gusts were not ascertained because the recording <a href="anemometer">anemometer</a> malfunctioned at the height of the storm. The hurricane passed in an unusually brief period of two hours, with most of the damage being done over the course of about 45 minutes. Roofs were "rolled up like tissue-paper" in the fierce winds, while chimneys and brick walls were toppled. In all, thousands of buildings in the city were unroofed, with many of them totally destroyed. Trees were variously uprooted or snapped in parks and cemeteries, including <a href="Forsyth%20Park">Forsyth Park</a>, considered the "pride of the city", which lost between half and three quarters of its trees. Piles of debris left streets impassable, even to pedestrians. Numerous large ships were driven ashore, though some survived unscathed, and dozens of smaller vessels were wrecked along waterways in the city. Several people, including the captain, drowned when the tugboat "Robert Turner" capsized in the <a href="Savannah%20River">Savannah River</a>. Another craft, the "Island Flower", sank nearby, killing three. The storm surge associated with the hurricane flooded low-lying coastal areas and washed away several miles of the <a href="Tybee%20Railroad">Tybee Railroad</a>. Wind gusts estimated at over demolished hotels and beachfront cottages on <a href="Tybee%20Island">Tybee Island</a>. Near <a href="Wilmington%20Island%2C%20Georgia">Wilmington Island</a>, a fisherman drowned after getting caught in the storm on a small boat.

In Burroughs, along the outskirts of Savannah, two churches were leveled and three people were killed. Residents there were forced to abandon their homes and endure the storm in open fields to avoid injury. Initial estimates placed damage in Savannah at more than $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ), a quarter of which resulted from devastation to railroads. In particular, the <a href="Savannah%2C%20Florida%20and%20Western%20Railway">Savannah, Florida and Western Railway</a> and <a href="Central%20of%20Georgia%20Railway">Central of Georgia Railway</a> sustained extensive losses, and about 50 <a href="streetcars">streetcars</a> in Savannah were destroyed. Overall, the storm killed at least 17 people in and around Savannah. Even before the storm subsided, people crowded the streets in a "stampede" to verify the safety of friends and family.

Southern South Carolina also saw the damaging effects of the storm, which was accompanied by estimated winds of up to . On the north side of the Savannah River, mills and outbuildings on rice plantations were destroyed. Powerful gusts shifted a <a href="drawbridge">drawbridge</a> spanning the river north of <a href="Hardeeville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Hardeeville</a>. Seven people in Hardeeville died in building failures, while train stations were blown down there and in <a href="Yemassee%2C%20South%20Carolina">Yemassee</a>. Around <a href="Beaufort%2C%20South%20Carolina">Beaufort</a>, the storm wrecked numerous boats and effected significant damage to homes and businesses. Wharves and warehouses were flooded, though low <a href="astronomical%20tide">astronomical tide</a>s limited the extent of the inundation. The winds peeled off tin roofs, allowing rainwater to douse home interiors. In <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>, tropical storm-force winds blew down fences, signs, and other light installations, but damage was generally minor, and no deaths were reported. The storm churned <a href="Charleston%20Harbor">Charleston Harbor</a> until waves breached <a href="seawall">seawall</a>s and flooded low-lying areas. Total damage in the state was around $25,000 (equivalent to $ million in ).

In North Carolina, the weakening tropical cyclone tracked through predominately rural areas, limiting its adverse effects. Nonetheless, severe winds affected the <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh</a>–<a href="Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina">Durham</a> area, uprooting trees and littering streets with debris. One woman was killed when a large oak tree fell on her bedroom. Damage to utility lines left Raleigh without communications or electricity, while in Durham, a four-story <a href="tobacco%20curing">tobacco curing</a> barn collapsed with about of tobacco inside, worth as much as $60,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). About $20,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in other property damage was attributed to the storm. Residents in <a href="Chapel%20Hill%2C%20North%20Carolina">Chapel Hill</a> described the storm as the most severe in recent memory.

As the cyclone expanded and accelerated, it entered Virginia with renewed violence, and produced what still stands as the most severe windstorm in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>'s history. Generally, the strongest winds were mostly confined to east of the storm center's track. The <a href="East%20End%20%28Richmond%2C%20Virginia%29">East End</a> of Richmond was hit particularly hard, but damage to church steeples, roofs, and chimneys was common throughout the whole city. Downed trees and broken branches carpeted the ground and clogged streets. All telegraph lines except one, which ran to <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, were rendered useless, while communications in <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Virginia">Petersburg</a> were entirely cut off. Damage in Richmond totaled $150,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Rural areas were also severely impacted; in <a href="Boydton%2C%20Virginia">Boydton</a>, the storm destroyed many barns and stables, crushing the livestock inside them. In farmlands throughout central Virginia, fences, crops, and outbuildings were blown down, stunting agriculture in the region.
The destruction continued into northern portions of the state; brick walls were toppled and about 500 <a href="shade%20tree">shade tree</a>s felled in <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg</a>. Farms in <a href="Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax</a> and <a href="Arlington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Arlington</a> counties were substantially damaged, and dozens of windmills were destroyed around <a href="Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia">Falls Church</a>. Wooden houses were blown away. In <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria</a>, four people were killed, while factories and homes along the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> were damaged. One of the fatalities occurred when a three-story brick building partially collapsed onto the roof of a smaller house. Across the city, large sheets of tin roofs were peeled off buildings and followed erratic paths before hitting the ground in a clangor that "produced a pandemonium long to be remembered." Property in Alexandria incurred about $400,000 in damage (equivalent to $ million in ). Despite the destruction in the city, surveys of the storm's effects revealed that initial reports of its severity were exaggerated. In some cases, damage was enabled or worsened by pre-existing structural flaws. In <a href="Manassas%2C%20Virginia">Manassas</a>, the winds shifted a church off its foundation.
Heavy rain fell along and west of the storm's track, most prodigiously in the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>. Reports of or more were common; in <a href="Dale%20Enterprise%2C%20Virginia">Dale Enterprise</a>, of rain fell in a period of 18 hours. Nearly of rain fell over <a href="Staunton%2C%20Virginia">Staunton</a> in a similarly short span of time. The rapid inflow of water caused a lake in Staunton's <a href="Gypsy%20Hill%20Park">Gypsy Hill Park</a> to rise until its <a href="earthen%20dam">earthen dam</a> failed around 10 p.m. local time, sending a large volume of water rushing into the town's business district. Along the way, the torrent swept away 25 homes, one of which was occupied by a family of four. Power was cut to the town after floodwaters inundated the electric plant, and multiple hotels, stores, and other businesses were extensively damaged. As waters rose, victims were forced to await rescue from their roofs. A local waterway known as Lewis Creek also overflowed its banks and contributed to the flooding. The Staunton flood took the lives of six people, and inflicted as much as $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in property damage. In the countryside, about 40 horses and mules drowned.

Deadly flooding also took place in <a href="Rockingham%20County%2C%20Virginia">Rockingham County</a>, affecting the communities of <a href="Bridgewater%2C%20Virginia">Bridgewater</a>, <a href="Elkton%2C%20Virginia">Elkton</a>, and <a href="Keezletown%2C%20Virginia">Keezletown</a>. Three fatalities were reported in the county, and local infrastructure sustained $20,000 in damage (equivalent to $ million in ). The <a href="South%20Fork%20Shenandoah%20River">South Fork Shenandoah River</a> at <a href="Luray%2C%20Virginia">Luray</a> swelled to —<a href="flood%20stage">flood stage</a> being —which still stands as one of its highest historical crests. In <a href="Stephens%20City%2C%20Virginia">Stephens City</a>, rushing waters crumbled bridges and washed out corn crops. A waterway in <a href="Waynesboro%2C%20Virginia">Waynesboro</a> reportedly rose and flowed with enough force to wipe nearby buildings off their foundations. Urban flooding also plagued <a href="Roanoke%2C%20Virginia">Roanoke</a> streets. From there to <a href="Hagerstown%2C%20Maryland">Hagerstown</a>, the <a href="Norfolk%20and%20Western%20Railway">Norfolk and Western Railway</a> was severely washed out in multiple places. In total, property damage in Virginia amounted to at least $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Strong winds and significant rainfall extended into <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, chiefly in northern and eastern parts of the state. Trees, fences, and houses were blown down in the <a href="Eastern%20Panhandle%20of%20West%20Virginia">Eastern Panhandle</a> region, while flash floods undermined railroads and destroyed entire fields of crops. Some livestock drowned around <a href="Old%20Fields%2C%20West%20Virginia">Old Fields</a>.

In <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, the storm's approach late on September 29 was marked by nearly continuous <a href="cloud%20to%20cloud%20lightning">cloud to cloud lightning</a>. Five-minute sustained southerly winds reached , and peak gusts approached ; barometric pressure fell to . At the time, it was the worst storm to ever affect the city. The winds brought down signs, awnings, trees, and brick walls, while unroofing homes, toppling church steeples, and shattering windows. Electric, telegraph, and telephone utilities were lost. The destruction was not uniform, as poorly built structures often survived unscathed in the vicinity of much stronger buildings that incurred significant damage. It was deduced that the strongest gusts occurred in narrow "streaks". Approximately 5,000 trees were destroyed in the city, many of them being snapped above the ground. Some of the worst damage occurred in cemeteries, such as the <a href="United%20States%20Soldiers%27%20and%20Airmen%27s%20Home%20National%20Cemetery">United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery</a>, where 300 trees were prostrated. In a few cases, the fallen trees unearthed underlying coffins.

A residence building under construction at the <a href="Catholic%20University%20of%20America">Catholic University of America</a> was dismantled, and the personal home of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> in <a href="Woodley%20Park">Woodley Park</a> lost its roof. Roofs of several government offices were also torn away, and the steeple of <a href="New%20York%20Avenue%20Presbyterian%20Church">New York Avenue Presbyterian Church</a> was "reduced to match wood". The <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution%20Building">Smithsonian Institution Building</a> sustained notable damage. Fallen trees littered the grounds of the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, among them being historic specimens like an <a href="elm">elm</a> planted by <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Some of the more celebrated trees were picked apart by passersby trying to procure souvenirs. The White House itself suffered some minor damage, mostly limited to dislodged <a href="Coping%20%28architecture%29">coping</a> and copper roofing, along with a few broken windows. Nearby, five men were entrapped and one killed when the Abert Building—a newly built, five-story brick structure on <a href="Pennsylvania%20Avenue">Pennsylvania Avenue</a>—partially collapsed in the storm, crushing two adjoining buildings. Over the coming months, tenants filed multiple lawsuits against the building's owner after at least one local builder asserted that the wall failure resulted from neglectful construction. The Abert Building was completely repaired by October 14.

On the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a>, where tides ran well above normal, ships broke free from their moorings and drifted downstream. In one instance, a large steamship called the "George Leary" struck and damaged six other ships. Numerous vessels capsized in the river, including the steamer "Mary Washington" and the schooner "John W. Linnell". At the <a href="Washington%20Navy%20Yard">Washington Navy Yard</a>, multiple buildings sustained damage. Overall losses in Washington, D.C. were approximately $400,000 (equivalent to $ million in ), and at least two dozen individuals in the city suffered injuries from falling debris.

Destructive winds continued into central Maryland. A report from <a href="Sandy%20Spring%2C%20Maryland">Sandy Spring</a> estimated that 20% of trees in the region were uprooted, splintered, or violently twisted, often falling on utility wires and roads. Some of the trees left standing were stripped of their limbs and reduced to bare trunks. Telegraph poles crashed to the ground in large numbers. In some cases, damage patterns and eyewitness accounts suggested the formation of <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es embedded within the larger storm system. As in northern Virginia, churches, homes, and businesses incurred significant damage, some being wholly destroyed. <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland">Montgomery County</a> was hit particularly hard; the storm wrecked an amusement park in <a href="Bethesda%2C%20Maryland">Bethesda</a>, forcing it to permanently close, while <a href="Gaithersburg%2C%20Maryland">Gaithersburg</a> was "most disastrously wrecked". Several individuals lost their lives in Montgomery County, including one man who died of a stress-induced heart attack. Most of the farms in central Maryland were affected to some degree. Periods of exceptionally heavy rainfall, amounting to in <a href="Flintstone%2C%20Maryland">Flintstone</a> and in <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a>, caused rapid rises along waterways in the Potomac River watershed, inundating adjacent low-lying areas. The <a href="Cumberland%20and%20Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad</a> line in Cumberland was washed out.

High tides in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> flooded streets in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis</a>. Farther north, at <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, water funneled into the <a href="Inner%20Harbor">Inner Harbor</a> and flooded the city's waterfront. <a href="Pratt%20Street">Pratt Street</a> was submerged waist deep, while an overflowing <a href="Jones%20Falls">Jones Falls</a> filled bordering streets with of water. Floodwaters drained into cellars and lower levels of warehouses, and forced some families to evacuate their homes. Hundreds of structures in Baltimore were damaged by the windstorm, and several small fires were ignited by downed power lines. Throughout Maryland, the storm took the lives of eight people and wrought $500,000 in damage (equivalent to $ million in ).

The storm arrived in Pennsylvania as an extratropical cyclone late on September 29, still accompanied by strong winds that disconnected wires and interrupted communications throughout the state. Property damage was severe in southeastern parts of the state, especially <a href="York%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">York</a> and <a href="Lancaster%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster</a> counties, where barns were demolished and houses unroofed. Wind gusts in <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a> peaked at shortly after midnight. Debris from trees and buildings rained down on the city's streets as the storm produced erratic damage patterns, characterized by distinct two- or three-block gaps in the destruction. Large trees were uprooted "with masses of earth clinging to them as big as a room." In all, damage reached $200,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in Harrisburg. On the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> at Philson, two freight trains violently collided, killing six <a href="Vagrancy%20%28people%29">vagrants</a>. Several more train wrecks were attributed to obstructing storm debris. In <a href="Steelton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Steelton</a>, an overpass collapsed onto the tracks of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> shortly before a train careened through the rubble, damaging the <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a> and several cars. Additionally, two <a href="Railway%20roundhouse">roundhouses</a> were destroyed in <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lebanon</a>, with eight locomotives sustaining damage in one of the structures.

The third incarnation of the <a href="Columbia%E2%80%93Wrightsville%20Bridge">Columbia–Wrightsville Bridge</a>—a covered railroad bridge across the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a>—was shoved off its piers and demolished by the intense winds. Several people were reportedly inside the bridge when it collapsed, but this was not confirmed. The stone, wood, and steel span was replaced by a steel truss bridge less than a year later. At <a href="Sunbury%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sunbury</a>, two steamboats sank in the Susquehanna. Across Lancaster County, hundreds of farmers lost their entire tobacco crops that were stored in barns and ready for market. Some of the tobacco barns were carried off their foundations and blown afield. The storm also destroyed more substantial brick structures. Damage in the county was estimated at $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ).
Two men died in the Patterson Coal Company miners' village in <a href="Shamokin%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shamokin</a> that was devastated by the winds and a subsequent fire that together destroyed dozens of houses and <a href="Shanty%20town">shanties</a>. The storm destroyed equipment and facilities at the nearby Colbert Colliery, putting hundreds of miners out of work. In <a href="Reading%2C%20Pennsylvania">Reading</a>, two men died in the collapse of an <a href="iron%20furnace">iron furnace</a> casting house which left five others badly injured. Six children lost their lives to a storm-induced fire in tenement housing belonging to a mining company in <a href="Natalie%2C%20Pennsylvania">Natalie</a>. Hundreds of trees were blown down or broken on the historic battlefield at <a href="Gettysburg%20National%20Military%20Park">Gettysburg National Park</a>, largely on <a href="Culp%27s%20Hill">Culp's Hill</a> and <a href="Big%20Round%20Top">Big Round Top</a>. The <a href="66th%20Ohio%20Infantry">66th Ohio Infantry</a> monument on Culp's Hill was destroyed by a fallen tree, and the nearby monument to the <a href="78th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry">78th</a> and <a href="102nd%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry">102nd</a> New York Volunteer Infantries sustained minor damage. In addition to the winds, several inches of rain fell in parts of the state; <a href="Altoona%2C%20Pennsylvania">Altoona</a> recorded of precipitation. Flash flooding along the <a href="Juniata%20River">Juniata River</a> rushed through <a href="Huntingdon%2C%20Pennsylvania">Huntingdon</a>, washing out streets and railways, inundating homes, and drowning livestock. Washouts and landslides plagued railroads throughout western Pennsylvania. Overall, the storm caused over $2 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage in the state.

Strong winds associated with the extratropical cyclone impacted parts of central and western <a href="New%20York%20State">New York State</a>, particularly around <a href="Syracuse%2C%20New%20York">Syracuse</a>; there, it was considered the worst storm in recent memory. Homes, barns, and factories lost their roofs in several towns, with some buildings near <a href="Ithaca%2C%20New%20York">Ithaca</a> being totally destroyed. Trees and communications lines suffered a similar fate as in many other areas along the storm's path. Trees in orchards were stripped of nearly all their fruit. <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a> endured winds that tore wires and damaged roofs. Farther east, wind gusts exceeded at <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, bringing down overhead wires. A switchboard at a <a href="telephone%20exchange">telephone exchange</a> in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> sparked a fire that caused $30,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage. Several steamships limped into port at New York with significant damage. From New Jersey to <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, trees, fences, chimneys, windows, and political campaign signs fell victim to the storm. On the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> at <a href="Newburgh%2C%20New%20York">Newburgh</a>, in the early morning hours on September 30, a tugboat collided with a passenger vessel, injuring two crew members of the former craft. "Considerable" wind damage extended north through the <a href="Hudson%20Valley">Hudson Valley</a>, and trains along the <a href="West%20Shore%20Railroad">West Shore Railroad</a> were delayed by landslides and washouts. Total property damage in New York was assessed at $50,000 (equivalent to $ million in ).

Heavy rainfall doused parts of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> for four days beginning on September 27. Resulting floods damaged crops and property, and the inclement weather disrupted <a href="William%20McKinley%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">William McKinley's presidential campaign</a> activities at his home in <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton</a>.

On September 30, gales from the former hurricane swept across the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. Hundreds of spectators lined the shores of <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> at <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, to watch the enormous waves. A schooner was torn from its moorings at Chicago, and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about. The schooner "Belle" from <a href="Racine%2C%20Wisconsin">Racine, Wisconsin</a>, went missing amid the storm, while the barge "Sumatra" broke up and capsized near <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee</a>, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first mate, and cook were safely rescued. The storm damaged around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes (equivalent to $ million in ).

Roosevelt dime

The Roosevelt dime is the current <a href="Dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dime</a>, or ten-cent piece, of the United States. Struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> continuously since 1946, it displays President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> and was authorized soon after his death in 1945.

Roosevelt had been stricken with <a href="polio">polio</a>, and was one of the moving forces of the <a href="March%20of%20Dimes">March of Dimes</a>. The ten-cent coin could be changed by the Mint without the need for <a href="79th%20United%20States%20Congress">congressional</a> action, and officials moved quickly to replace the <a href="Mercury%20dime">Mercury dime</a>. <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Chief Engraver</a> <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a> prepared models, but faced repeated criticism from the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>. He modified his design in response, and the coin went into circulation in January 1946.

Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime has been struck continuously in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from striking the coin in <a href="silver">silver</a> to <a href="base%20metal">base metal</a> in 1965, and the design remains essentially unaltered from when Sinnock created it. Without rare dates or silver content, the dime is less widely sought by <a href="coin%20collecting">coin collectors</a> than other modern U.S. coins.

President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> died on April 12, 1945, after leading the United States through much of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Roosevelt had suffered from <a href="polio">polio</a> since 1921 and had helped found and strongly supported the <a href="March%20of%20Dimes">March of Dimes</a> to fight that crippling disease, so the ten-cent piece was an obvious way of honoring a president popular for his war leadership. On May 3, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> Representative <a href="James%20Hobson%20Morrison">James Hobson Morrison</a> introduced a bill for a Roosevelt dime. On May 17, Treasury Secretary <a href="Henry%20Morgenthau%20Jr.">Henry Morgenthau Jr.</a> announced that the <a href="Mercury%20dime">Mercury dime</a> (also known as the Winged Liberty dime) would be replaced by a new coin depicting Roosevelt, to go into circulation about the end of the year. Approximately 90 percent of the letters received by Stuart Mosher, editor of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>" (the journal of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>), were supportive of the change, but he himself was not, arguing that the Mercury design was beautiful and that the limited space on the dime would not do justice to Roosevelt; he advocated a <a href="United%20States%20commemorative%20coin">commemorative silver dollar</a> instead. Others objected that despite his merits, Roosevelt had not earned a place alongside <a href="George%20Washington">Washington</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Jefferson</a> and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a>, the only presidents honored on the circulating coinage to that point. As the Mercury design, first coined in 1916, had been struck for at least 25 years, it could be changed under the law by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Bureau of the Mint</a>. No congressional action was required, though the committees of each house with jurisdiction over the coinage were informed.

Creating the new design was the responsibility of <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Chief Engraver</a> <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>, who had been in his position since 1925. Much of the work in preparing the new coin was done by Sinnock's assistant, later chief engraver <a href="Gilroy%20Roberts">Gilroy Roberts</a>. In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted models to Assistant Director of the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>. This commission reviews coin designs because it was tasked by a 1921 <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a> by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks.

The models initially submitted by Sinnock showed a bust of Roosevelt on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> and, on the reverse, a hand grasping a <a href="Torch%23Symbolism">torch</a>, and also clutching sprigs of <a href="olive%20branch">olive</a> and <a href="Oak%23Cultural%20significance">oak</a>. Sinnock had prepared several other sketches for the reverse, including one flanking the torch with scrolls inscribed with the <a href="Four%20Freedoms">Four Freedoms</a>. Other drafts showed representations of <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">the goddess Liberty</a>, and one commemorated the <a href="United%20Nations%20Conference%20on%20International%20Organization">United Nations Conference</a> of 1945, displaying the <a href="War%20Memorial%20Opera%20House">War Memorial Opera House</a> where it took place. Numismatist David Lange described most of the alternative designs as "weak". The models were sent on October 12 by Howard to <a href="Gilmore%20Clarke">Gilmore Clarke</a>, chairman of the commission, who consulted with its members and responded on the 22nd, rejecting them, stating that "the head of the late President Roosevelt, as portrayed by the models, is not good. It needs more dignity." Sinnock had submitted an alternative reverse design similar to the eventual coin, with the hand omitted and the sprigs placed on either side of the torch; Clarke preferred this.
Sinnock attended a conference at the home of <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a>, sculptor member of the commission, with a view to resolving the differences, and thereafter submitted a new model for the obverse, addressing the concerns about Roosevelt's head. The <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a>, <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a>, sent photographs to the commission, which rejected it and proposed a competition among five artists, including <a href="Adolph%20A.%20Weinman">Adolph A. Weinman</a> (designer of the Mercury dime and <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">Walking Liberty half dollar</a>) and <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a> (who had sculpted the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a>). Ross declined, as the Mint was under great pressure to have the new coins ready for the March of Dimes campaign in January 1946. The new Treasury Secretary, <a href="Fred%20Vinson">Fred Vinson</a>, was appealed to, but he also disliked the models and rejected them near the end of December. Sinnock swapped the positions of the date and the word , allowing an enlargement of the head. He made other changes as well; according to numismatic author <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, "Roosevelt had never looked better!"

Lawrie and Vinson approved the models. On January 8, Ross telephoned the commission, informing them of this. With Sinnock ill (he died in 1947) and the March of Dimes campaign under way, Ross did not wait for a full meeting of the commission, but authorized the start of production. This caused some ill-feeling between the Mint and the commission, but she believed that she had fulfilled her obligations under the executive order.

The obverse of the dime depicts President Roosevelt, with the inscriptions and . Sinnock's initials, , are found by the cutoff of the bust, to the left of the date. The reverse shows a torch in the center, representing liberty, flanked by an olive sprig representing peace, and one of oak symbolizing strength and independence. The inscription <a href="E%20pluribus%20unum"></a> (out of many, one) stretches across the field. The name of the country and the value of the coin are the legends that surround the reverse design, which is symbolic of the victorious end of World War II.

Numismatist Mark Benvenuto suggested that the image of Roosevelt on the coin is more natural than other such presidential portraits, resembling that on an art medal. <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in his comprehensive volume on U.S. coins, argued that "the new design was ... no improvement at all on Weinman's [Mercury dime] except for eliminating the <a href="fasces">fasces</a> [on its reverse] and making the vegetation more recognizably an olive branch for peace." Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> called the Roosevelt dime "a clean, satisfying and modestly stylish, no-nonsense coin that in total view comes forth with notes of grandeur".
Some, at the time of design and since, have seen similarities between the dime and a plaque depicting Roosevelt sculpted by African-American sculptor <a href="Selma%20Burke">Selma Burke</a>, unveiled in September 1945, which is in the Recorder of Deeds Building in Washington; Burke was among those alleging her work was used by Sinnock to create the dime. She advocated for this position until her death in 1994, and persuaded a number of numismatists and politicians, including Roosevelt's son <a href="James%20Roosevelt">James</a>. Numismatists who support her point to the fact that Sinnock took his depiction of the <a href="Liberty%20Bell">Liberty Bell</a>, which appears on the 1926 <a href="United%20States%20Sesquicentennial%20coinage">Sesquicentennial half dollar</a> and <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">Franklin half dollar</a> (1948–1963), from another designer without giving credit. However, Robert R. Van Ryzin, in his book on mysteries about U.S. coins, pointed out that Sinnock had sketched Roosevelt from life in 1933 for his first presidential medal (designed by Sinnock), and accounts from the time of issuance of the dime state that Sinnock used those, as well as photographs of the president, to prepare the dime. A 1956 obituary in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" credits <a href="Marcel%20Sternberger">Marcel Sternberger</a> with taking the photograph that Sinnock adapted for the dime. According to Van Ryzin, the passage of time has made it impossible to verify or rule out Burke's allegations.

The Roosevelt dime was first struck on January 19, 1946, at the Philadelphia Mint. It was released into circulation on January 30, which would have been President Roosevelt's 64th birthday. The planned release date had been February 5; it was moved up to coincide with the anniversary. With its debut, Sinnock became the first chief engraver to be credited with the design of a new circulating U.S. coin since <a href="Barber%20coinage">those designed</a> by <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a> were first issued in 1892. The release of the coins was a newsworthy event, and demand for the new design remained strong, although many of Roosevelt's opponents, particularly <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>, were outraged. There were reports of the new dime being rejected in vending machines, but no changes to the coin were made. The dime's design has not changed much in its over seventy years of production, the most significant alterations being minor changes to Roosevelt's hair and the shifting of the mint mark from reverse to obverse in the 1960s.

At the time the dimes were released, <a href="Cold%20War">relations with the USSR</a> were deteriorating, and Sinnock's initials, , were deemed by some to refer to Soviet leader <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, placed there by a communist sympathizer. Once these rumors reached Congress, the Mint sent out press releases debunking this myth. Despite the Mint's denial, there were rumors into the 1950s that there had been a secret deal at the <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Conference</a> to honor Stalin on a U.S. coin. The controversy was given fresh life in 1948 with the posthumous release of Sinnock's Franklin half dollar, which bears his initials .

Although usually more coins were struck at Philadelphia than at the other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a> or at <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco</a>. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to announce in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered at the end of the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.

With the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201965">Coinage Act of 1965</a>, the Mint transitioned to striking <a href="cladding%20%28metalworking%29">clad</a> coins, made from a sandwich of <a href="cupronickel">copper nickel</a> around a core of pure <a href="copper">copper</a>. There are no mint marks on coins dated from 1965 to 1967, as the Mint made efforts to discourage the hoarding that it blamed for the coin shortages that had preceded the 1965 act. The Mint modified the master <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hub</a> only slightly when it began clad coinage, but starting in 1981, made minor changes that lowered the coin's relief considerably, leading to a flatter look to Roosevelt's profile. This was done so that <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23D">coinage dies</a> would last longer. Mint marks resumed in 1968 at Denver and for <a href="proof%20coin">proof coin</a>s at San Francisco. Although the California facility beginning in 1965 occasionally struck dimes for commerce, those bore no mint marks and are indistinguishable from ones minted at Philadelphia. The only dimes to bear the "S" mint mark for San Francisco since 1968 have been proof coins, resuming a series coined from 1946 to 1964 without mint mark at Philadelphia. Since 1992, silver dimes with the pre-1965 composition have been struck at San Francisco for inclusion in annual proof sets featuring silver coins.

In 1980, the Philadelphia Mint began using a mint mark "P" on dimes. Dimes had been struck intermittently during the 1970s and 1980s at the <a href="West%20Point%20Mint">West Point Mint</a>, in Roosevelt's home state of New York, to meet demand, but none bore a "W" mint mark. This changed in 1996, when dimes were struck there for the 50th anniversary of the Roosevelt design. Just under a million and a half clad 1996-W dimes were minted; these were not released to circulation, but were included in the year's <a href="mint%20set">mint set</a> for collectors. In 2015, silver dimes were struck at West Point for inclusion in a special set of coins for the March of Dimes, including a dime struck at Philadelphia and a silver dollar depicting Roosevelt and polio vaccine developer Dr. <a href="Jonas%20Salk">Jonas Salk</a>. Mintages generally remained high, with a billion coins each struck at Philadelphia and at Denver in many of the clad years.

In 2003, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> Representative <a href="Mark%20Souder">Mark Souder</a> proposed that former president <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, who was then dying of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, replace Roosevelt on the dime once he died, stating that Reagan was as iconic to conservatives as Roosevelt was to liberals. Reagan's wife <a href="Nancy%20Reagan">Nancy</a> expressed her opposition, stating that she was certain the former president would not have favored it either. After Ronald Reagan died in 2004, there was support for a design change, but Souder declined to pursue his proposal.

Due to the large numbers struck, few regular-issue Roosevelt dimes command a premium, and the series has received relatively little attention from collectors. Only clad coins remain in circulation: prominent among these are the dimes struck at Philadelphia in 1982 erroneously minted and released without the mint mark "P"; these may sell for $50 to $75. As no official mint sets were issued in 1982 or 1983, even ordinary dimes of those years from Philadelphia or Denver <a href="coin%20grading">in pristine condition</a> command a significant premium (worn ones do not). Far more expensive are the dimes erroneously issued in proof condition in 1970, 1975 and 1983 that lack the "S" mint mark. One of only two known from 1975 sold at auction in 2011 for $349,600.

Gothic boxwood miniature

Gothic boxwood miniatures are very small <a href="Christianity">religious</a> wood sculptures produced during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly in <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">today's Low Countries</a>, at the end of the <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic period</a> of the emerging <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a>. They consist of highly intricate layers of <a href="relief">relief</a>s often rendered to nearly microscopic level. The miniatures are made from <a href="Buxus">boxwood</a> <a href="wood%20carving">wood carving</a>s. Buxus has a fine grain and high density suitable for detailed micro-carving. There are around 150 surviving examples. The majority are spherical beads (known as <a href="prayer%20nut">prayer nut</a>s), statuettes, skulls, or coffins; some 20 are in the form of <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a>s including <a href="triptych">triptych</a> and <a href="diptych">diptych</a> <a href="altarpieces">altarpieces</a>, <a href="Church%20tabernacle">tabernacle</a>s and <a href="monstrance">monstrance</a>s. The polyptychs are typically 10–13 cm in height. Most of the beads are 10–15 cm in diameter, and designed so they could be held in the palm of a hand during personal devotion or hung from necklaces or belts as fashionable accessories.

Boxwood miniatures were highly prized in the early 16th century. Their iconography, form, and utility can be linked to medieval <a href="ivory%20carving">ivory carving</a>s, as well as contemporary <a href="Miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">illuminated miniatures</a>, altarpieces, panel paintings, sculpture, <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s, and engravings. They typically contain imagery from the life of <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary</a>, the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion of Jesus</a>, and vistas of <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a> and <a href="Hell">Hell</a>. Each miniature's production required exceptional craftsmanship, and some may have taken decades of <a href="man-hours">cumulative work</a> to complete, suggesting that they were commissioned by high-ranking nobles.

A number of the miniatures appear to have come from a workshop led by Adam Dircksz, who is thought to have produced dozens of miniatures. Almost nothing is known about Dircksz or the artisans who produced the miniatures. Some of the original owners can be identified from markings, usually initials or coats of arms, emplaced by the sculptors. Important collections of boxwood miniatures are in the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Ontario">Art Gallery of Ontario</a>, in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> as part of the <a href="Waddesdon%20Bequest">Waddesdon Bequest</a>, and at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York. Because of their rarity and the difficulty in discerning their intricacy from reproductions, boxwood miniatures have not been as widely studied as other forms of Netherlandish visual art.

<a href="Buxus%20sempervirens">Boxwood</a> is a dense hardwood with fine <a href="Wood%20grain">grain</a>, resistant to splitting and chipping—ideal for wood carving. In the 16th century, <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> blocks used for <a href="woodblock%20printing">woodblock printing</a> were usually made of boxwood. Uses for boxwood were similar to those for ivory in medieval carvings, but with boxwood a far less expensive option than ivory. Designs were overseen by master craftsmen who must have had access to prints and <a href="woodcuts">woodcuts</a> of contemporary works of art, and who were apparently influenced by diptych and triptych panel paintings.

Boxwood grows slowly, so the trunk remains fairly narrow, a fact that impedes the size of any carvings made from any single piece. The wood assumes an even, soft and tactile surface if polished or frequently handled, such as was the case for prayer nuts. The wood loses its tactility when painted, explaining why most of the miniatures are in monochrome. Polychromy reduced the legibility of the carvings, "quite apart from the difficulty of effectively coloring such tiny and complex scenes" as the art historian <a href="Frits%20Scholten">Frits Scholten</a> has noted.

The tools used in production were similar to those used in the production of larger <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>s and included <a href="saw">saw</a>s, <a href="Plane%20%28tool%29">planes</a>, <a href="card%20scraper">card scraper</a>s, chisels, <a href="auger%20%28drill%29">augers</a>, braces, and <a href="gimlet%20%28tool%29">gimlets</a>. Wood was cut into the required dimensions as blocks, after which the <a href="joiner">joints</a> were carved out. Prayer beads were made on a <a href="lathe">lathe</a> used to <a href="Woodturning">turn</a> the wood. The woodcutters carved a single block of boxwood into a sphere, cut it in half, hollowed it out, and attached a fastening hinge and carrying loops. The carvings in the interiors were typically made separately from the smaller hemispheres and later fitted onto an outer shell. In some cases, these wooden shells were placed in a silver housing.
Because of their diminutive scale, the pieces were produced using magnifying glasses. The very small wood pieces were difficult to brace (hold in place) during carving. They were likely positioned on a bench, between two posts, so that they could be turned around. Domed spaces, intended to evoke church architecture, were drilled or carved, and these were divided using <a href="compass">compass</a>es and a <a href="straightedge">straightedge</a> into pie-shaped segments. A surface plane was established onto which the <a href="relief">relief</a>s were added. These were created from multiple separate wood sheets, individually produced before being joined in layers. Major figures, usually saints, were carved from single blocks of wood. Relief components were either glued into prefixed niches, or they were bound with pegs, which were sometimes functional and obviously visible or implanted into the relief form. Because of this layered structure, they are often fragile.
An example of this layering technique is in the "Last Judgement" prayer bead (AGO 29365) attributed to Adam Dircksz and now located at the Art Gallery of Ontario, where some thirty minuscule, individually carved spikes are set into the ceiling vault and around Christ to suggest rays of light. Punctuations in the wood suggesting stars were added to the ceiling via tiny drilled holes.

The level of detail indicates the use of magnification in their production, probably with the same instruments used by contemporary jewellers. Describing these intricacies, the art historian Eve Kahn writes that the works can be so rich that "individual feathers are visible on angel wings, and dragon skins are textured with thick scales. Crumbling shacks are shown with shingles missing from their gabled roofs. Saints' robes and soldiers' uniforms are trimmed with buttons and embroidery, and there are minute representations of jewelry and rosary beads".

Only one miniature is explicitly dated, a triptych (WB.232) in the <a href="Waddesdon%20Bequest">Waddesdon Bequest</a> at the British Museum is inscribed with "1511". A minority bear a <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> or other indications of origin or the source of commission. A carving in the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20de%20Cluny%20%E2%80%93%20Mus%C3%A9e%20national%20du%20Moyen%20%C3%82ge">Musée de Cluny</a>, Paris, contains the letter "M", and must have been completed before the 1524 inventory of <a href="Margaret%20of%20Austria%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Savoy">Margaret of Austria</a>. Approximate dates for other examples can be inferred from the inventories of their owners. The rosary beads owned by Henry VIII must have been produced between his marriage to Catherine in 1509 and his earliest efforts to separate from her in 1526.

Most surviving boxwood miniatures are attributed to <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a> artisans working in the <a href="Burgundian%20Netherlands">Burgundian</a> and <a href="Habsburg%20Netherlands">Habsburg Netherlands</a> during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Due to their quality and stylistic similarities to
the full sized Flemish and <a href="Brabantine%20Gothic">Brabantine</a> altarpieces, they were for centuries assumed to originate from <a href="Southern%20Netherlands">Southern Netherlands</a>, however more recent research has found that a majority of the early owners came from the northern provinces of <a href="County%20of%20Holland">Holland</a> and <a href="Zeeland">Zeeland</a>. There are examples from Italy, although according to Wilhelm Bode, "The broad monumental tendency of Italian art, especially in sculpture, seems to exclude a taste for daintily executed small works". German examples include a carving encased in a miniature skull, now in the Art Gallery of Ontario, which contains branchwork ("Astwerk") of a type often found in contemporary German sculpture.

That a majority of the miniatures share technical, stylistic, and thematic similarities, and could be considered as a near homogeneous group was first noted by the art historian Jaap Leeuwenberg. Such stylistic traits include broad and densely populated animated scenes, often placed, in the words of the art historian William Wixom, on "steeply angled ground planes of tiled floors". Other shared features include spatial devices, figures in contemporary dress, and draperies arranged in angular folds. On this basis Leeuwenberg attributed a large number of the objects to Dircksz, around 35-40, although that estimate has been revised down in more recent years.
The art historians Lisa Ellis and <a href="Alexandra%20Suda">Alexandra Suda</a> estimate that the more complex boxwood miniatures may have taken decades of work to complete, a period equivalent to the entire career of a medieval master carver. Production was organised between different workshops of specialised artisans. Because the miniatures are so intricate, only a small number of workshops were likely involved in their production. Due to this high degree of artistry, art historians presume they were intended as luxury items and status symbols for a high-born and sophisticated European elite; <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII of England</a> and <a href="Catherine%20of%20Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI</a> and <a href="Albert%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Albert V of Bavaria</a> are known to have owned individual boxwood miniatures.

Because of shared characteristics, including common use of <a href="horror%20vacui">horror vacui</a>, similar spatial approaches and use of depth, as well as similar hinges and methods of construction, Leeuwenberg has suggested that production of a number of the miniatures was overseen by a single master named Adam Dircksz, Dircksz was first identified through a signature on a prayer nut now in the <a href="Statens%20Museum">Statens Museum</a> Copenhagen, reading "Adam Theodrici me fecit" ("Adam Dircksz has made me"). The Latin name "Adam Theodrici" may be translated into English as "Adam of Theodoric", but art historians usually use the Dutch version of his name, Adam Dircksz. Although it was rare in the 16th century for artists to sign a work, when done, it usually took the "me fecit" (made me) form, in effect of making the object speak.

Almost nothing is known about Dircksz except that the works were produced c. 1500-30. The signature may indicate that he was a woodcutter, sculptor, <a href="medallist">medallist</a>, or just simply the patron. Dircksz is thought to have been active between 1500 and 1530, and responsible for some sixty of the surviving examples. He may have led a workshop in the southern Netherlands, possibly at <a href="Delft">Delft</a> or <a href="North%20Brabant">Brabant</a>, given that Flemish inscriptions appear on some of the carvings, and that, apart from Henry VIII and Catherine, all of the original owners come from the Netherlands.

Regardless of the number of works that Dircksz or his workshop can be attributed with, art historians often debate what the artistic and technical precedents for the miniatures might be. Scholten observes how, to a large extent, it seems "as if this exquisite sculpture was born <a href="ex%20nihilo">ex nihilo</a> around 1500", but points out that "giant strides are rarely made in art history", pointing to affinities with silversmith's art, especially the miniature architectural elements often found in ecclesiastical silver and ornaments.

Boxwood miniatures follow in the tradition of earlier Christian sculptures, including ivory diptychs, sculptures of the Virgin and Child, and relief carvings. They are similar in style to larger scale contemporary artworks, especially Flemish panel paintings, altarpieces, and sculpture, and they were conceived with similar religious outlook and conviction. Their <a href="iconography">iconography</a> is often a mix of <a href="Old%20Testament">Old</a> and <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> scenes, with depictions of the Nativity and Passion being the most common. Although the central subject matter may be similar across many pieces, there are considerable differences in composition. Expansive depictions, such as of the Crucifixion, were sometimes influenced by contemporary literature. The objects' dramatic and incongruous impact, being both tiny and hugely expansive at the same time, are particularly suited to depictions of Heaven and Hell.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art broadly categorises boxwood miniatures into two groups, those with simple reliefs and those with complex design. Of the 150 surviving examples, the majority are single prayer beads, often with extravagant combinations of carving, Gothic <a href="tracery">tracery</a>, and <a href="Epigraphy">inscriptions</a> on the outer shells. They often take the form of two hemispheres joined by a <a href="girdle">girdle</a> with hinges and clasps, with the interiors hollowed out to accommodate the elaborate carvings.

Apart from the more usual prayer nuts and polyptychs, other formats include statuettes, round <a href="pendant">pendant</a>s, coffins, statuettes, perfume flasks, and <a href="memento%20mori">memento mori</a> in the form of skulls (this latter format was also used for contemporary <a href="fruitwood">fruitwood</a> carvings with equally dramatic and intense results).

Owing to the commonality of materials, production techniques, and the general absence of paint application, the miniatures had similar original colouring. This diverged over the centuries, given various storage and handling methods, as well as different restorations and coating applications.

The tracery used for geometric decoration on the exteriors can be categorised into three different styles. One style superimposes intersecting circles around the head of the dome. A second uses small circles to punctuate and divide the dome into segments. The third style is a combination of the first two, but far more complex, and uses the arcs of the circles to link the first style's looping circles with the second style's repeating patterns. Yet all of the works are similar in proportion, circumference and the size of the hinge and clasps.

The English term "Prayer nut" comes from the equivalent Dutch word "gebedsnoot", and took on common usage in the 18th century. The use of the word "nut" may be derived from the fact that some of the beads were actually carved from nuts or pits, and although no such miniatures survive, it was a known practice in medieval southern Germany. They are mostly the same shape (deliberately designed to resemble apples), decorated with carved openwork Gothic tracery and flower-heads, and of a size suitable for holding in the palm of a hand.

Prayer nuts often contain central scenes depicting episodes from the life of <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary</a> or the <a href="Passion%20of%20Jesus">Passion of Jesus</a>. Some are a single bead; more rare are those consisting of up to eleven beads, including the "<a href="Chatsworth%20House">Chatsworth</a> Rosary" gifted by Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon, which is one of only two surviving boxwood rosaries. The figures are often dressed in fashionable contemporary clothing. The level of detail extends to the soldier's shields, their jacket buttons, jewellery, and candles. In some instances, they contain carved inscriptions usually related to the meaning of the narrative. There are more modest examples, such as the two medallions making up the "<a href="Half%20of%20a%20Prayer%20Bead%20with%20the%20Lamentation">Half of a Prayer Bead with the Lamentation</a>" (MS 17.190.458a, b) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which shows the Virgin and Child alongside a kneeling nun holding a string of beads, and a <a href="Piet%C3%A0">Pietà</a>. The two images are unusually simple for the type; only a small portion of the available surface of the borders contain inscriptions.
The beads are quite uniform in size and shape, with a diameter ranging from around 30 to 65 millimetres. Suda notes how their "spiritual impact...[was] curiously..in inverse proportion to their size". They were often made as two half-shells that could be opened to reveal intricate interior detail. According to the art historian Dora Thornton, when the prayer nut was opened out, it "revealed the representation of the divine hidden inside. The interiors range considerably in complexity and detail, with the more simple consisting of a low reliefs cut into a disc that has been rounded off at the back. At their most detailed and complex, Suda describes how the beads "played out like a grand opera on a miniature stage, complete with exotic costumes, elaborate props and animals large and small" and observes how they have an "<a href="Alice%20in%20Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>" quality, wherein "one tumbles headlong into the tiny world created by the carver...into the world they reveal beyond one’s immediate surroundings."

Scholten notes that the tracery may have been intended to suggest that the object contained a small <a href="relic">relic</a>, "so that the object took on the character of a <a href="talisman">talisman</a> and was deemed to have an <a href="Apotropaic%20magic">apotropaic</a> effect". A number contain a wooden loop in the middle of one half so they could be worn hanging from a belt, or carried in a case. A fragrant substance was sometimes placed inside the shell, which diffused when the beads were opened, making them comparable to the then fashionable <a href="pomander">pomander</a>s.

The shape of a prayer nut likely carried deep significance; with the outer sheath representing Christ's human flesh; the bead stand, his cross; and the interior reliefs, his divinity. According to Thornton, "unfolding the nut is in itself an act of prayer, like opening up a personal illuminated prayer book, or watching the leaves of a large scale altarpiece being hinged back in a church service". However, Scholten questions their use for private religious devotion, noting how their diminutive scale made them impractical for meditation, as their imagery was not discernible without a magnifying glass or strong spectacles.

Miniature boxwood triptychs, diptychs, and other polyptychs are typically altarpieces, with <a href="Church%20tabernacle">tabernacles</a> and monstrances more rare. The multi-paneled works exist in both horizontal and landscape formats, and were usually formed from a single block of wood with its components hinged together. Triptychs generally followed the format and style of their larger-scale counterparts, with a central panel with major saints and two ancillary wings.
The polyptychs usually served as portable devices for laypersons, used for private devotion, and their popularity reflects the growing affluence of merchants living in the major northern European ports. Their iconography often follows contemporary larger scale panel altarpieces, with depictions of Christ Carrying the Cross, and the <a href="Triumphal%20entry%20into%20Jerusalem">Entry into Jerusalem</a> as common subjects. The altarpieces typically consist of three major elements; an architectural housing, interior reliefs, and a base or <a href="predella">predella</a>, which may be fixed or detachable. In turn, each of these elements may have several components, which were either pinned or bound with glue. They usually contain folding wings, carved in low relief and with smaller figures and scenes around the borders of the central pictorial space. Typically, the larger fixed elements were connected with interlocking <a href="mortise%20and%20tenon">mortise and tenon</a> joins cut into the slabs.

A triptych altarpiece (MMA 17.190.453) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art has a compartment (receptacle) for holding relics which is covered by a hinged disc. An especially detailed and complex 25.1 cm high triptych catalogued as WB.232 in the British Museum, credited to the workshop of Adam Dircksz, contains two triptychs on upper and lower registers. The upper, far larger register consists of a central panel with a background Crucifixion and numerous foreground figures; a <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">Resurrection</a>, <a href="Burial%20of%20Jesus">Entombment</a> and other scenes are on the right-hand wing, while depictions of <a href="Christ%20Carrying%20the%20Cross">Christ Carrying the Cross</a> and the <a href="Sacrifice%20of%20Isaac">Sacrifice of Isaac</a> are the main features of the left wing.
The reliefs are typically positioned on a horizontal plane, and allow a long space between the tops of the figures and the end of the typically rounded overhead arches. The panels are usually quite shallow, with just enough depth in the <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niche</a> to position the figures, which can be either free-standing or carved in high relief. The niches vary in profile, with 
<a href="dome">dome</a> or mushroom shapes being most common. Other features, including architectural or landscape elements, were similarly inserted fully formed; in more elaborate and detailed examples, the reduced scale was too constrained to create all of the elements in relief. The approach also mirrors the practice employed by contemporary northern European artists working on full-scale altarpieces.

Many of the features of the miniatures resemble contemporary northern Gothic style architecture. Only the example, in the British Museum, contains an Italian Renaissance influence, evident in its <a href="baluster">baluster shafts</a> and the <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s containing prophets on either side of the Crucifixion. The late 15th-century veneration for the Passion of Jesus and the <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Sorrows">Sorrows of Mary</a> had a strong bearing on the design and form of many of these types of altarpieces. Part of the appeal of the Passion was the contrast between relatively simple scenes from the Life of Christ, juxtaposed against more complex scenes with detailed vistas, such as the Crucifixion or depictions of Heaven and Hell.

Boxwood miniatures seemed to have served three original functions: aids to private devotion, luxury objects of status, and novel playthings. Later they became precious family heirlooms passed from generation to generation, but as medieval art fell out of fashion in the early modern period, their provenance was often lost. The earliest record of a collection is the 1598 inventory of the <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Bavaria">dukes of Bavaria</a>, which contain several boxwood miniatures.

Of the surviving works, over one hundred re-emerged in the 19th century Parisian antiquarian market, then the leading market for medieval art. During this period, they were acquired by collectors such as the British collector <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Wallace%2C%201st%20Baronet">Richard Wallace</a> (1818–90), who purchased <a href="%C3%89milien%20de%20Nieuwerkerke">Count van Nieuwerkerke</a>'s (1811–92) entire collection, including two boxwood prayer nuts, the Vienna-born collector of objets d’art <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Spitzer">Frédéric Spitzer</a> (1815−90), and <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Ferdinand de Rothschild</a> (1839-98). Spitzer was not a purist and commissioned <a href="metalsmith">metalsmith</a>s to produce modern versions, or copies, of a variety of medieval artworks. Today, there are four surviving boxwood carvings he had augmented for the market.

When the American financier <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a> purchased Baron <a href="Oppenheim%20family">Albert Oppenheim</a>'s collection in 1906, he acquired four boxwood miniatures, including a triptych with the Crucifixion and Resurrection, and a prayer nut showing the Carrying of the Cross, all of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Canadian publishing magnate <a href="Kenneth%20Thomson%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Thomson%20of%20Fleet">Kenneth Thomson</a> was an important collector for over 50 years, and his collection included the world's largest gathering of boxwood miniatures, including two skulls, two triptychs and six prayer beads. These were bequeathed to the Art Gallery of Ontario, along with three other works collected by his family after his death.

Objects of this scale are difficult to view with the naked eye, and, even when held in hand, the true level of intricacy is not easily recognised. The difficulty of producing magnified reproductions contributes to the fact that there has been comparatively little research into the format. Even traditional photography can fail to convey the true level of detail. Meaningful reproduction can only be achieved by computer modelling, where a series of photographs at various <a href="aperture">focal depths</a> are <a href="Focus%20stacking">stacked</a> to attain consistent sharpness.

Modern imaging technology has greatly improved the study of the objects since the late 20th century, including the use of x-ray. Micro <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a>ning, using technology similar to medical scanning, allows the capture of thousands of images which can then be assembled into a three-dimensional model.

Kalākaua coinage

The Kalākaua coinage is a set of silver coins of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a> dated 1883, authorized to boost Hawaiian pride by giving the kingdom its own money. They were designed by <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>, <a href="Chief%20Engraver">Chief Engraver</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20the%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a>, and were struck at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>. The issued coins are a dime (ten-cent piece), quarter dollar, half dollar, and dollar.

No immediate action had been taken after the 1880 act authorizing coins, but King <a href="Kal%C4%81kaua">Kalākaua</a> was interested and government officials saw a way to get out of a financial bind by getting coins issued in exchange for government bonds. Businessman <a href="Claus%20Spreckels">Claus Spreckels</a> was willing to make the arrangements with the United States in exchange for profits from the coin production, and contracted with the US Mint to have $1,000,000 worth of coins struck. Originally, a 12 cent piece was planned and a few specimens were struck, but it was scrapped in an effort to have uniformity between US and Hawaiian coins, and a dime was substituted. The coins were struck at San Francisco in 1883 and 1884, though all bear the earlier date.

The coins met a hostile reception from the business community in Honolulu, who feared inflation of the currency in a time of recession. After legal maneuvering, the government agreed to use over half of the coinage as backing for paper currency, and this continued until better economic times began in 1885. After that, the coins were more eagerly accepted in circulation. They remained in the flow of commerce on the islands until withdrawn in 1903, after Hawaii had become a US territory.

<a href="Native%20Hawaiians">Native Hawaiians</a> before the arrival of <a href="Captain%20Cook">Captain Cook</a> in 1770 used no coins; trade in their agricultural economy was based on barter. Early relations between Hawaiians and explorers were also based on barter, with nails, beads, and small pieces of iron sometimes being used as money, but as more systematic foreign trade began at the turn of the 19th century, coins of many lands came to the islands as payment for exports. The arrival of the missionaries, and the plantations and other commercial activity that soon followed, led to the first currencies generated by the islands: tokens and <a href="scrip">scrip</a> used to pay workers because of the chronic shortage of small change. The trade ties and cultural connections with the United States led the early Hawaii business community to think in terms of the US dollar, and it became the basis for trade, with the Hawaiian royal government periodically publishing tables of the value of non-US coins in terms of the dollar. This was necessary because such coins, brought to the islands by foreign trade, circulated as a means of exchange alongside American silver and gold pieces.

In 1847, King <a href="Kamehameha%20III">Kamehameha III</a> issued a one-cent coin, most likely struck by a firm in New England. It was unpopular with merchants, who preferred not to deal with such small amounts. Some were issued in change in government transactions, but only about 12,000 ever circulated. The failure caused the government to reconsider plans to issue more denominations of coins.

By 1883, most coins on the islands were American, due to the close economic integration between islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii reflected this, making gold American coins <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> for an unlimited amount and American silver coins legal tender to $50. In 1879, the kingdom issued its first currency notes, technically certificates of deposit, redeemable in silver coin and with denominations ranging from $10 to $500.

At that time in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if purchased with silver; only gold could be used for certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver in the hands of the public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.

Finance chair <a href="Walter%20M.%20Gibson">Walter M. Gibson</a>, supported by Minister of the Interior <a href="Samuel%20G.%20Wilder">Samuel G. Wilder</a>, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase gold and silver bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was one means by which the government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his <a href="Kal%C4%81kaua%27s%201881%20world%20tour">world tour of 1881</a>. During this journey, he was contacted by the owner of a <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto <a href="Ua%20Mau%20ke%20Ea%20o%20ka%20%CA%BB%C4%80ina%20i%20ka%20Pono">Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono</a> (The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, fifty cents, twenty-five cents, and twelve and one-half cents. Twelve and one-half cents, or one bit (one <a href="Spanish%20colonial%20real">Spanish colonial real</a>) was sometimes the day's pay for a laborer.

A National Loan Act provided for $2 million in bonds, but due to its poor creditworthiness, the kingdom had been unable to sell them. Gibson hit upon the idea of combining the two acts by appointing businessman <a href="Claus%20Spreckels">Claus Spreckels</a>, a close friend of the king, as government agent to contract with the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> to have coins struck there, and for Spreckels to be paid in government bonds. In March 1883, the cabinet council authorized Finance Minister <a href="John%20M%C4%81kini%20Kapena">John Mākini Kapena</a> to make the arrangement with Spreckels, who received formal authority for this role in May. H.A.P. Carter, Hawaiian envoy in Washington, acted as intermediary between the Hawaiians and the US government, and wrote to Kapena in June that the US authorities regarded the agency arrangement as peculiar, since a more usual way of proceeding would have been for the Hawaiian government to contract directly, and to pay for the coins in cash.
Spreckels was already in correspondence with American authorities; in January 1883, the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the United States Mint</a>, <a href="Horatio%20Burchard">Horatio Burchard</a>, had written to him explaining the laws under which the Mint could strike coins for foreign governments, and that although the coins could be struck at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>, the dies for the coinage would have to be prepared at <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia</a>. He asked for sketches from Spreckels, who provided an obverse showing a full-face portrait of the king; this was submitted to <a href="Chief%20Engraver">Chief Engraver</a> <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a> in Philadelphia, who rejected it as impractical. Barber recommended the king be shown in profile, and a suitable photograph was sent to him for use in preparing models of the proposed coins. Once the Mint received Spreckels' commission as agent, Acting Director <a href="Robert%20E.%20Preston">Robert E. Preston</a> wrote noting that the authorization called for 12 cent pieces, but that the Hawaiian law had called for coins identical in size, weight, and fineness to US coins, and there was no such denomination struck by the US Mint. He asked if ten-cent pieces were desired instead, but no answer was immediately forthcoming, and Barber finished preliminary designs, including the 12 cent piece.

Barber finished <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a> for the four coins in September 1883, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent <a href="A.%20Loudon%20Snowden">A. Loudon Snowden</a> had two sets struck and sent to Preston in Washington. Snowden praised the beauty of the coins, and was happy that Barber had required less <a href="relief">relief</a> than needed on US coins of like value, since this meant the coins would be easier for the Mint to strike. Preston sent the coins to Spreckels in San Francisco, and authorized Philadelphia to make additional sets, both for <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">its coin cabinet</a> and for the director's office in Washington. Barber was instructed to make five sets of coining dies for each denomination, to be sent to the San Francisco Mint, with instructions that no coins were to be struck pending a final contract with Spreckels, and that the dies were to remain Hawaiian government property, to be turned over on request.

The formal contract was dated October 29, signed by Spreckels as agent for Hawaii, and by San Francisco Mint Superintendent E. F. Burton. It provided for $1,000,000 in coins: $500,000 in silver dollars, $300,000 in half dollars, $125,000 in quarter dollars and $75,000 in dimes. The Hawaiian government made the change from 12 cent pieces to dimes because it was negotiating a monetary convention with the United States and wanted its coins to conform to America's, though this convention never went into force. By mid-November the change had been noticed by the Mint, and Spreckels sent confirmation and a go-ahead to make dies for the dime, on the understanding that a revised authorization would be needed from Honolulu before production of dimes could begin. This was received in December. By this time, the kingdom's order was already in production, having started with a run of half dollars in November. Barber did not complete work on hubs for the dime until January 1884, and dies were not dispatched to San Francisco until February, though they are dated 1883. Once he had received the dies for the ten-cent coin, Burton sent the unneeded dies for the 12 cent piece to the director's office in Washington.

Spreckels supplied the bullion for the coins, at a cost of about $850,000. He paid $17,500 as the Mint's fee for striking the coins, $2,500 for designs, and $250 for dies. A final change reduced the total value in dimes to $25,000 (250,000 coins) while increasing the value in half dollars to $350,000 (700,000 coins).

Both sides of each coin were designed by <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>. The obverse displays a naked bust of Kalākaua. He is surrounded by his name and title; the date appears beneath. W. T. R. Marvin, writing in 1883 for the "American Journal of Numismatics", said he had been told by those who had seen the coins that "the profile head of the King compares favorably with that of many rulers of much more important countries". Ernest Andrade, who chronicled the controversy caused by the coins, wrote that they bore Kalākaua's profile, "admittedly a handsome one".
The dollar, half dollar and quarter dollar bear the royal arms, set forth most fully on the dollar, where the shield is emblazoned on a mantle, possibly ermine. Marvin suggested the famous feather cloak worn by Kamehameha the Great as a more appropriate choice than the fur to bear the arms. Below the shield on the dollar is suspended the Star of the Order of Kamehameha, and above it is the royal crown. Around the coin is <a href="Ua%20Mau%20ke%20Ea%20o%20ka%20%CA%BB%C4%80ina%20i%20ka%20Pono">Hawaii's motto</a>, words spoken by Kamehameha following a time of distress. To either side is and ; below is the denomination of one dollar rendered in Hawaiian, . Dala became the Hawaiian term for dollar in missionary times as words changed to conform to the smaller Hawaiian alphabet. Dollar is rendered "dala" in speech in many parts of Asia and the Pacific.

The reverses of the half dollar and quarter dollar bear the arms without the mantle and order, encircled by the motto, with the denomination expressed respectively as meaning half dollar, and , quarter dollar. Each of the two coins pairs its fraction with the , on either side of the shield. The 12 cent piece, known today only by a few <a href="proof%20coin">proof pieces</a>, bears a wreath with a crown separating its branches, and with the motto surrounding. The denomination is within the wreath, expressed as . That design was adapted for the dime, with the denomination within the wreath expressed as , and below the wreath , both meaning ten cents.

The first shipment of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii was still in an economic recession. A number of members of the business community, including <a href="Sanford%20B.%20Dole">Sanford B. Dole</a>, objected to the issue on the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange for anything except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, on the grounds that the silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of <a href="mandamus">mandamus</a> against the government giving the Dole plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the full court, though, Judd was reversed, as the court found that Dole and his associates should have filed for an <a href="injunction">injunction</a>. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.

Spreckels and his partners William G. Irwin and F. F. Low formed the Spreckels & Company Bank in Hawaii in 1884, for the specific purpose of circulating the silver coins. The first Hawaiian silver coin known to have been spent, a half dollar, was found among the receipts at the Honolulu Music Hall on January 10, 1884. It was placed in a pendant and given to the leading lady. The new coinage went into general circulation on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and the coins (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to mean that they were accepted, or that <a href="Gresham%27s%20Law">Gresham's Law</a> (bad money drives out good) was in operation. The Hawaiian Treasury had been almost out of cash before receiving the coins, and they entered commerce as the government paid for goods and services, increasing the money supply and risking inflation. Within six months of issue, the coins traded against American currency at a discount of 2 percent.
Dole and his allies in the legislature used the coin issuance as a means of attacking the government, accusing Gibson and others of disobeying the laws, and demanding information on Spreckels' profits, which the government stated was about three percent after costs such as transport and insurance were calculated. The political fallout of the coinage was the 1884 election-year shift towards the <a href="Independent%20%28Kuokoa%29%20Party">Kuokoa (independent) Party</a> in the legislature. The Currency Act of 1884, passed after the election, restricted acceptance of silver coin as payment to debts under $10, and limited the exchange of silver for gold at the treasury to $150,000 a month. The new silver coins were expected to flow into the Treasury in exchange for gold under this arrangement, but the government refused to implement the law until forced to by the Supreme Court. To avoid a financial panic, major private banks and businesses agreed to exchange gold for the new silver coins, in which there was little public confidence. But in February 1885, faced with a government refusal to pay out gold (of which the Treasury was almost bare), the private businesses stopped this arrangement. Negotiations followed, and the government reluctantly agreed to sequester more than $550,000 of the coins in a special account to back the banknotes then in circulation. Although this left the government with little liquidity, the increased confidence in its finances allowed it to borrow on a short-term basis. By mid-1885, sugar prices were rising, and prosperity was returning to the islands. Greater amounts of gold flowed into the islands, balancing the silver that was already there, and stabilizing the monetary situation. The Kalākaua coins became more acceptable, and by 1888, most of the non-US foreign silver had been exchanged for them. They remained in circulation during the turbulent years of the 1890s in Hawaii, as the monarchy fell and the short-lived republic ended in 1898 with annexation to the United States. Despite the urging of local interests, it was not until 1903 that Congress acted, ordering that the Hawaii silver coins be exchanged by January 1, 1904, or lose status as legal tender. By 1907, coins worth about $814,000 of the $1,000,000 originally issued had been redeemed; they were exchanged for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint.

Of the coins that were not redeemed, some were likely lost in the fires that devastated Honolulu's Chinatown in 1887 and 1900. Members of that community were often distrustful of banks, and hid valuables in their homes. Quantities of the remainder were used in the jewelry trade, which bought several thousand dollars worth in the final months the coins remained legal tender. In the years after territorial status was granted Hawaii in 1900, many sought keepsakes of the vanished kingdom, and a large variety of souvenir items featuring the coins were sold as enameled (and unenameled) jewelry: pins, watch fobs, cuff links, belt buckles, hat bands and hat pins. Decorative items such as spoons and napkin rings were also made. Generally, the side featuring the coat of arms is the one enameled.

Members of the coin collecting community own some of the Kalākaua pieces. <a href="Richard%20S.%20Yeoman">Richard S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" in its 2018 edition lists the quarter dollar as generally the least expensive Hawaii coin, ranging from $50 to $375 for the pieces struck for circulation. <a href="Proof%20coin">Proof coin</a>s are much more expensive, especially the 12 cent piece (hapawalu), a copy of which brought $43,125 at auction in 2011. The Kalākaua coins have been reproduced, and their designs repurposed for privately issued medals. The dies for the original coins were cancelled and are in the <a href="Hawai%CA%BBi%20State%20Archives">Hawaiʻi State Archives</a>.

Fantasy Book

Fantasy Book is a defunct <a href="Semiprozine">semi-professional</a> American <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> that published eight issues between 1947 and 1951. The editor was <a href="William%20L.%20Crawford">William Crawford</a>, and the publisher was Crawford's <a href="Fantasy%20Publishing%20Company%2C%20Inc.">Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc.</a> Crawford had problems distributing the magazine, and his budget limited the quality of the paper he could afford and the artwork he was able to buy, but he attracted submissions from some well-known writers, including <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A. E. van Vogt</a>, <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, and <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>. The best-known story to appear in the magazine was <a href="Cordwainer%20Smith">Cordwainer Smith</a>'s first sale, "<a href="Scanners%20Live%20in%20Vain">Scanners Live in Vain</a>", which was later included in the <a href="The%20Science%20Fiction%20Hall%20of%20Fame%2C%20Volume%20One%2C%201929%E2%80%931964">first Science Fiction Hall of Fame anthology</a>, and is now regarded as one of Smith's finest works. <a href="Jack%20Gaughan">Jack Gaughan</a>, later an award-winning science fiction artist, made his first professional sale to "Fantasy Book", for the cover illustrating Smith's story.

The first <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> (SF) magazine, "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", appeared in 1926, and by the mid-1930s SF <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a>s were a well-established genre. In 1933, <a href="William%20L.%20Crawford">William Crawford</a>, a Pennsylvania science fiction fan, started "Unusual Stories", a semi-professional SF magazine, and he followed this with "<a href="Marvel%20Tales">Marvel Tales</a>" in 1934. Neither of the magazines lasted long or achieved wide distribution, though he obtained stories from <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford Simak</a>, <a href="P.%20Schuyler%20Miller">P. Schuyler Miller</a>, and <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>, all of whom were established writers. After World War II, Crawford, by now living in Los Angeles, founded <a href="Fantasy%20Publishing%20Company%2C%20Inc.">Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc.</a>, and in 1947 he launched "Fantasy Book" in <a href="Bedsheet">bedsheet format</a>. The editor was listed as "Garret Ford"; this was a pseudonym for Crawford and his wife, Margaret. Some additional editorial work was done by <a href="Forrest%20J%20Ackerman">Forrest Ackerman</a>.

By the time the first issue was printed in mid-1947, Crawford's distributor had gone out of business, leaving him with 1,000 copies on hand. He attempted to sell the issue through subscription and placed some for sale via specialist dealers. Crawford did not always have access to high-quality paper, and he decided to produce two versions of the second issue: one on book-quality paper, priced at 35 cents, and another on lower-quality paper, priced at 25 cents, intended for newsstand distribution, each featuring different cover artwork. The third and fourth issues were also produced in two versions with different covers, and the same price difference. With the third issue, Crawford reduced the size to <a href="Digest%20size">digest</a>, announcing, "The change in size may be inconvenient to some collectors—but it has become a question of a small FB or "no" FB at all".

The lack of a reliable distributor continued to be a problem; Crawford commented in the fourth issue that he had still not obtained reliable nationwide distribution for the magazine. The remaining issues were all in digest format, except for issue 6, which shrank to a small digest size. The eighth and final issue appeared in January 1951.

Crawford still had in inventory stories he had acquired for "Marvel Tales" over a decade earlier, and "People of the Crater" by <a href="Andre%20Norton">Andre Norton</a> (under the pseudonym Andrew North), which appeared in the first issue, was one of these. There was also a story by <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A. E. van Vogt</a>, "The Cataaaa", and <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>'s "The Black Lotus", which had first appeared in 1935 in "Unusual Stories". Crawford's budget limited the quality of the artwork he could acquire—he sometimes was unable to pay for art—but he managed to get Charles McNutt, later better known as <a href="Charles%20Beaumont">Charles Beaumont</a>, to contribute interior illustrations to the first issue. Wendy Bousfield, a science fiction historian, describes his work as "strikingly original", and considers the first issue to be the most artistically attractive of the whole run.

The next two issues featured covers by Lora Crozetti on the "de luxe" editions; sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> considers both to be "appalling", and Bousfield describes them as "crude and uninspired". Van Vogt appeared in both issues, with "The Ship of Darkness" and "The Great Judge", and the second issue featured the first installment of "The Machine-God Laughs", by <a href="Festus%20Pragnell">Festus Pragnell</a>, which was serialized over three issues. The fourth issue saw the beginning of another serial: "Black Goldfish", by John Taine (a pseudonym for the mathematician <a href="Eric%20Temple%20Bell">Eric Temple Bell</a>); it ran for two issues. Bousfield describes both serials as "among the weakest stories "FB" published". A third serial, "Journey to Barkut", by <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>, began in the seventh issue and was left incomplete when the magazine ceased publication. It subsequently appeared in full in "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>" in 1952.

<a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, shortly to become the founder of <a href="Dianetics">Dianetics</a>, the precursor of <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a>, contributed "Battle of the Wizards" to issue 5, and the sixth issue saw two notable stories. One was "<a href="The%20Little%20Man%20on%20the%20Subway">The Little Man on the Subway</a>", by <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> and <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, under the pseudonym "James MacCreigh"; Asimov had rewritten Pohl's first draft and submitted it to <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John Campbell</a> at "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>" in 1941, who had rejected it. The other was "<a href="Scanners%20Live%20in%20Vain">Scanners Live in Vain</a>", by <a href="Cordwainer%20Smith">Cordwainer Smith</a>. This was a pseudonym for Paul A. Linebarger, a professor of Asian politics and a military advisor, who had written the story, inspired by his knowledge of psychology, some years before; he tried to sell it to the leading SF magazines during the war, but had been rejected. The story was Smith's first sale, and is now regarded as a classic—SF critic <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a> describes it as "one of [Smith's] finest works", Pohl said that "it is perhaps the chief reason why ["Fantasy Book"] is remembered",

SF critics <a href="Malcolm%20Edwards">Malcolm Edwards</a> and <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a> describe "Fantasy Book" as "generally an undistinguished and erratic magazine", but Ashley comments that small-press magazines such as "Fantasy Book", by providing an outlet for stories that could not sell elsewhere, provided a valuable service to the genre.

All eight issues of the "Fantasy Book" were published by Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc. (FPCI), of Los Angeles, and edited by "Garret Ford", a pseudonym for William and Margaret Crawford. The first two issues were in bedsheet format, and the remaining issues in digest format, except for issue 6 which was a small digest. The first two issues were 44 pages long; the next two were 68 pages; issues 5 and 6 were 84 pages and 112 pages respectively; the last two issues were both 82 pages. The price was 25 cents for all issues except for the three "de luxe" variant editions of issues 2, 3, and 4, which were 35 cents.

Two anthologies were drawn mostly or entirely from the stories published in "Fantasy Book". In 1949, Crawford anonymously edited "The Machine-God Laughs", which contained Pragnell's story and two more stories from "Fantasy Book". It was published by Griffin Publishing, which was owned by Crawford. In 1953, Crawford's other publishing company, FPCI, issued "Science and Sorcery", edited by "Garret Ford", the pseudonym used by the Crawfords when they edited "Fantasy Book". It contained fifteen stories, nine of which had originally appeared in "Fantasy Book".

1998 NFC Championship Game

The 1998 NFC Championship Game was a <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) game played on January 17, 1999, to determine the <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">National Football Conference</a> (NFC) <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">champion</a> for the <a href="1998%20NFL%20season">1998 NFL season</a>. The <a href="Road%20%28sports%29">visiting</a> <a href="1998%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">Atlanta Falcons</a> defeated the heavily favored <a href="1998%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season">Minnesota Vikings</a> 30–27 in <a href="Sudden%20death%20%28sport%29">sudden death</a> <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">overtime</a> to win their first conference championship and advance to the franchise's first <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> appearance. As a result of their loss, the Vikings were eliminated from the playoffs and became the first team in the <a href="History%20of%20the%20National%20Football%20League">history of the NFL</a> to compile a <a href="National%20Football%20League%20regular%20season">regular season</a> record of 15–1 and not win the Super Bowl.

The game is considered one of the most memorable conference championship games in NFL history. In <a href="1998%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season">1998</a>, the Vikings were the favorite to win the Super Bowl, as they had set the NFL record for most points scored by a team in a single season. They had gone undefeated in their <a href="home%20%28sports%29">home stadium</a>, the <a href="Hubert%20H.%20Humphrey%20Metrodome">Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a>, during the regular season, and their <a href="placekicker">placekicker</a>, <a href="Gary%20Anderson%20%28placekicker%29">Gary Anderson</a>, had become the first kicker in NFL history to convert every <a href="field%20goal">field goal</a> and <a href="Conversion%20%28gridiron%20football%29">extra point</a> attempt in a season. At a critical moment late in the game, Anderson missed a field goal for the first time that year, which, if converted, would have given the Vikings a nearly insurmountable 10-point lead. Instead, the Falcons scored a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> to tie the game on their ensuing <a href="Glossary_of_American_football%23drive">drive</a> and subsequently won by a field goal in overtime. Due to its impact on the game's outcome, Anderson's missed field goal has since become the focal point of the loss.

The Falcons lost 34–19 to the <a href="1998%20Denver%20Broncos%20season">Denver Broncos</a> two weeks later in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXIII">Super Bowl XXXIII</a>. Neither the Falcons nor the Vikings would return to the Super Bowl until the <a href="2016%20NFL%20season">2016 NFL season</a>, when the Falcons lost in overtime to the <a href="2016%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">New England Patriots</a> in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LI">Super Bowl LI</a>. Although the game long stood as the proudest moment in the history of the Falcons franchise, the 1998 NFC Championship Game has been remembered for the effect it had on the Vikings players and their fan base, as it is seen by some sportswriters as one of the most devastating losses in NFL history.

Before the <a href="1998%20NFL%20season">1998 NFL season</a>, the Minnesota Vikings had accumulated a history of disappointing losses. Although they were the first franchise to appear in four Super Bowls, they lost each time and became the first franchise to lose four Super Bowls as a result. They had not appeared in a Super Bowl since their fourth loss following the 1976 season, although they had come close in other seasons. In a <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20NFL%20playoffs">1975 Divisional round playoff game</a>, the Vikings lost to the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> as a result of a <a href="Hail%20Mary%20pass">50-yard touchdown pass</a> from <a href="Roger%20Staubach">Roger Staubach</a> to <a href="Drew%20Pearson%20%28American%20football%29">Drew Pearson</a> in the game's final seconds, a play in which Vikings observers claim that Pearson should have been penalized for <a href="pass%20interference">pass interference</a>. The Vikings also lost to the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> in the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20NFL%20playoffs">1987 NFC Championship Game</a>, during which Vikings <a href="running%20back">running back</a> <a href="Darrin%20Nelson">Darrin Nelson</a> dropped a game-tying touchdown pass in the game's final seconds. Due to this history of misfortune, the <a href="NFL%20Network">NFL Network</a> ranked the Vikings as the second most "snake-bitten" franchise of all-time, behind only the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>.

Under head coach <a href="Dennis%20Green">Dennis Green</a>, the Vikings were perennial playoff contenders throughout the 1990s, but they experienced little success once they reached the postseason. In the first round of the <a href="1998%20NFL%20Draft">1998 NFL Draft</a>, the Vikings selected <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> <a href="Randy%20Moss">Randy Moss</a>, who, despite his talent, was passed by several teams, even those in need of a wide receiver, due to concerns surrounding Moss's misbehavior and multiple arrests during <a href="secondary%20school">high school</a> and <a href="college">college</a>. Moss used this as motivation to make teams who passed on him regret their decision. That year, Moss set the <a href="List%20of%20National%20Football%20League%20records%20%28individual%29">NFL record</a> for most touchdown receptions by a rookie with 17, and combined with future <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> wide receiver <a href="Cris%20Carter">Cris Carter</a> and quarterback <a href="Randall%20Cunningham">Randall Cunningham</a>, he formed the centerpiece of the Vikings' offensive attack, which also set an <a href="List%20of%20National%20Football%20League%20records%20%28team%29">NFL record</a> by scoring 556 points during the season. The Vikings' defense was led by future Hall of Fame defensive tackle <a href="John%20Randle">John Randle</a> and was ranked sixth overall in points allowed during the season.

The Vikings finished the regular season with a record of 15–1 and held the first overall seed in the NFC playoffs; the two previous NFL teams to finish the regular season with 15 wins, the <a href="1984%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season">1984 San Francisco 49ers</a> and the <a href="1985%20Chicago%20Bears%20season">1985 Chicago Bears</a>, had each won the Super Bowl. Former player turned analyst <a href="Brian%20Baldinger">Brian Baldinger</a> claimed that "They were easily the best team in football," and Pro Football Hall of Fame writer <a href="Ray%20Didinger">Ray Didinger</a> observed, "It seems like this is the unstoppable team." <a href="Dan%20Barreiro">Dan Barreiro</a>, a <a href="sports%20radio">sports radio</a> host in the <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> area, noted that for the Vikings franchise, 98 was the season. All the stars had aligned."

Vikings placekicker Gary Anderson had joined the team that <a href="Season%20%28sports%29%23Off-season">off-season</a> after playing for three different teams in his 16-year NFL career. In 1998, he became the first placekicker in NFL history to convert every field goal and extra point attempted. He finished the regular season 35/35 on field goals, with a long of 53 yards, and 59/59 on extra points. As a result, he was voted to the <a href="1999%20Pro%20Bowl">1998 NFC Pro Bowl team</a>, the fourth <a href="Pro%20Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> invitation of his career, and was voted to the <a href="Associated%20Press">AP</a> <a href="All-Pro">All-Pro</a> team for the first time. He also converted every field goal and extra point attempt in a Divisional playoff round victory against the <a href="Arizona%20Cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a> the week before the NFC Championship. Entering the NFC Championship Game, his last miss was on December 15, 1997, against the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, when he was a member of the San Francisco 49ers.

The Atlanta Falcons had "frustrating" team history, as described by Atlanta sports journalist <a href="Terence%20Moore">Terence Moore</a>. Moore singled out the <a href="1980-81%20NFL%20playoffs">1980 divisional playoff game</a> against the Dallas Cowboys, in which the Falcons gave up a 14-point lead en route to a defeat, as well as a 6-<a href="Turnover%20%28gridiron%20football%29">turnover</a> performance during their <a href="1991-92%20NFL%20playoffs">1991 divisional playoff</a> defeat against the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> as notable examples of frustration. Prior to the 1998 season, the Falcons had never advanced to the NFC Championship game, let alone to a Super Bowl. 

The <a href="1998%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">1998 season</a> was not expected to be any different, as the Falcons had failed to reach the playoffs the previous two seasons and only made the playoffs twice in the previous fifteen seasons. However, head coach <a href="Dan%20Reeves">Dan Reeves</a>, who was hired before the <a href="1997%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">previous season</a>, had overhauled the roster in an attempt to reverse the team's fortunes. Thirty-eight of the fifty-three players on the 1998 Falcons team had been brought in by Reeves over the previous year, including <a href="journeyman%20quarterback">journeyman quarterback</a> <a href="Chris%20Chandler">Chris Chandler</a>, who had a career-best season in 1998. Running back <a href="Jamal%20Anderson">Jamal Anderson</a> also posted a career-high 1846 rushing yards, which led the <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">NFC</a> that year, and the defense finished fourth overall in points allowed. As a result, the Falcons won the <a href="NFC%20West">NFC West</a> with a record of 14–2 and clinched 2nd overall seed in the NFC playoffs, behind only the Vikings. The team was nicknamed the "Dirty Birds" after a touchdown dance created by <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a> <a href="O.J.%20Santiago">O.J. Santiago</a> but popularized by Anderson.

After experiencing chest pains following the team's 27–17 victory over the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> on December 13, Reeves underwent <a href="coronary%20artery%20bypass%20surgery">quadruple bypass surgery</a>. The team was coached by <a href="defensive%20coordinator">defensive coordinator</a> <a href="Rich%20Brooks">Rich Brooks</a> for the final two regular season games. Reeves was able to return to the team in time for their first playoff game, in which the Falcons beat their division rival, the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>, to clinch a spot in the Conference Championship. Despite an impressive season, they were not expected to match up well against the Vikings, who had beaten teams by an average of 23.22 points at home that year and were installed as 11-point favorites for the Championship Game.

The Falcons won the <a href="coin%20flipping">coin toss</a> before the game and elected to receive the opening <a href="Kickoff%20%28gridiron%20football%29">kickoff</a>. They drove down the field and scored first on a five-yard touchdown pass to Jamal Anderson. On the next drive, the Vikings answered the score with a 31-yard touchdown pass from Cunningham to Randy Moss, tying the game at 7. Neither team scored in the remainder of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Gary Anderson kicked a field goal after the Vikings recovered a Falcons fumble to make the score 10–7. After forcing the Falcons to punt on the next drive, the Vikings scored another touchdown on a one-yard run by Cunningham, increasing the lead to 17–7 with five minutes remaining in the first half. The Falcons then lost another fumble, which gave possession back to the Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Moss dropped what would have been a touchdown pass in the <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a>, leaving Gary Anderson to kick another field goal to make the score 20–7. After forcing another Falcons punt, the Vikings attempted to increase their lead before halftime, but Falcons lineman <a href="Chuck%20Smith%20%28defensive%20end%29">Chuck Smith</a> forced a fumble on Cunningham, and the Falcons recovered the ball deep in Vikings territory. The Falcons subsequently scored on a 14-yard touchdown pass from <a href="Chris%20Chandler">Chris Chandler</a> to <a href="Terance%20Mathis">Terance Mathis</a> to cut their deficit to 20–14 by the end of the half.

The Falcons forced the Vikings to punt on the opening drive of the second half, and two long plays by wide receiver <a href="Tim%20Dwight">Tim Dwight</a> set up a 27-yard field goal by <a href="Morten%20Andersen">Morten Andersen</a>, which cut the Falcons' deficit to three points. The Vikings answered the score on their ensuing possession, driving 82 yards in 15 plays to score a touchdown on a five-yard <a href="Matthew%20Hatchette">Matthew Hatchette</a> reception, which made the score 27–17 with just over 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter. The Falcons responded with a 70-yard completion to <a href="Tony%20Martin%20%28American%20football%29">Tony Martin</a>, which set up a 24-yard field goal by Morten Andersen to make the score 27–20. On the ensuing Vikings drive, Cunningham fumbled a snap and the Falcons recovered the ball on the Vikings' 30-yard line; the Falcons failed to score after an incomplete pass <a href="Turnover%20on%20downs">turned the ball over on downs</a> with six minutes left in the game. The Vikings then drove down to the Falcons' 22-yard line, where an incomplete pass on 3rd down set up a field goal attempt by Gary Anderson.

The incompletion on <a href="Down%20%28gridiron%20football%29">3rd down</a> stopped the clock with 2:11 left in the game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away, which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the <a href="Hubert%20H.%20Humphrey%20Metrodome">Metrodome</a>, there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected the kick. The ball was snapped on 4th down with <a href="Punter%20%28football%29">punter</a> <a href="Mitch%20Berger">Mitch Berger</a> holding from the left <a href="hash%20marks">hash mark</a>. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a> <a href="Michael%20Booker">Michael Booker</a> on the left side of the <a href="line%20of%20scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a> and cornerbacks <a href="Ronnie%20Bradford">Ronnie Bradford</a> and <a href="Ray%20Buchanan">Ray Buchanan</a> on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked him to the ground after the kick. The ball sailed about a foot wide left of the upright with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson momentarily stood on the field with arms akimbo before heading to the sideline, as Falcons players celebrated around him.

A converted field goal would have given the Vikings a 10-point lead, which would have almost certainly clinched victory, according to "<a href="Pro%20Football%20Prospectus">Pro Football Prospectus</a>" and the NFL Network documentary "The Missing Rings". Citing a mathematical algorithm by sports analytics company <a href="numberFire">numberFire</a>, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Post">The New York Post</a>" reported that the Vikings had a 95.23% chance of winning the game had Anderson converted the field goal.

The Falcons took possession of the football at their own 29-yard line and quickly drove down the field. With just over a minute left in the game, Vikings safety <a href="Robert%20Griffith">Robert Griffith</a> dropped an interception off of a deflected pass, which would have also almost certainly clinched victory. Instead, Chandler threw a touchdown pass to Mathis on the next play, tying the game 27–27 with 49 seconds remaining in regulation. On the ensuing possession, the Vikings managed only seven yards and then <a href="Quarterback%20kneel">kneeled</a> on third down, which ran out the clock and forced overtime; the first team to score in the overtime period would win.

The Vikings won the coin toss and started overtime with possession of the football on their own 29-yard line, but managed to convert only one first down and punted to Atlanta. The Falcons drove to their own 41-yard line before being stopped on 3rd down, and they punted the ball back to Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Cunningham attempted a deep pass to Moss that was narrowly broken up by <a href="Eugene%20Robinson">Eugene Robinson</a>; had the pass been completed, it most likely would have resulted in a touchdown and victory for the Vikings. Instead, the Vikings had to punt on 4th down again. The Falcons then drove to the Vikings' 21-yard line, where Morten Andersen converted a 38-yard field goal for the win.

After the game, Gary Anderson was described as "inconsolable". Although the Vikings still led by seven points at the time, his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on the team. <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> contributor Ben Goessling noted "how swiftly it pulled the bottom out from under a team that had an air of inevitability about it to that point." Writing for the website "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>", Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' <a href="general%20manager">general manager</a> at the time, observed that, "Our team played the rest of the game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time." Randle concurred, describing his reaction to the kick as, "I was standing there like someone just punched me in my stomach, and was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God.

Carter openly wept in the <a href="locker%20room">locker room</a> after the game and was affected so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. "Walking off that field and losing like that," Carter reflected, "I didn't even know if I wanted to play football anymore. Because I just, I felt like that I would never win after that." He went on to call the game, "The most devastating loss that I've ever been a part of." Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player ever reached the Super Bowl in their careers.

Randle described the feeling after the game as, "It's like driving down a street and getting every green light for the next ten miles, and you're just cruising along, and it's just smooth. And all of a sudden, you're getting there, you're almost there, and all of a sudden, the fucking light turns red, and you get sideswiped." Randle further laments the loss due to the background of many of his teammates, whom he described as "misfits, guys who just got their second chance." Beyond Moss's legal troubles, Carter had been released by the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> early in his career for <a href="substance%20abuse">substance abuse</a> issues, and Cunningham was released by the Eagles and remained unsigned to a team <a href="1996%20NFL%20season">two seasons prior</a>. Randle himself was considered undersized coming out of <a href="college%20football">college</a> and was not heavily pursued by NFL teams.

Cunningham drew on his religious faith to persevere through the loss, believing that God had a reason for everything to happen. Years later, he reflected, "It just wasn’t our destiny to be in the Super Bowl. That’s my conclusion. Because if it was, we would have gone." Immediately after the game, he expressed this belief in an attempt to console Carter. The <a href="1999%20NFL%20season">following season</a>, Cunningham was <a href="Substitution%20%28sport%29">benched</a> for poor play after six games and was released by the Vikings at the end of the year. He also would never play in a Super Bowl.

Overjoyed with victory, Falcons players also wept after the game, and the team ripped open pillows and threw feathers in celebration on their <a href="Air%20charter">charter flight</a> back to <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. Buchanan stated that the win "feels like a miracle" due to the negative perception of the Falcons in years past. "This team was dirt. People stepped on us and wiped their feet on the doormat. Now we feel like a bunch of <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>s." Chandler joked that due to his game-winning field goal, Morten Andersen "gets to keep his <a href="Permanent%20residence%20%28United%20States%29">green card</a>", referring to Andersen's <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> nationality, while running back Jamal Anderson felt vindicated for the media's continuous focus on the Vikings in the days leading up to the game, which made him feel disrespected.

Falcons defensive end Chuck Smith questioned the Vikings' toughness because of the ease with which they had won during the season. "It's one thing to beat up on people," said Smith, "but how do you react when someone's finally hitting you back? We've been slugging it out all year." Years later, Smith went on to criticize Gary Anderson in particular for his missed field goal and its contribution to the Vikings' loss.

By virtue of their loss, the 1998 Vikings became the first team in NFL history to compile a regular season record of 15–1 and not win the Super Bowl. <a href="Fox%20Sports">Fox Sports</a>, <a href="NBC%20Sports">NBC Sports</a>, and the <a href="NFL%20Network">NFL Network</a> each named the team as one of the five greatest not to win the Super Bowl, and coach Dennis Green believed that the 1998 Vikings would have been considered the best NFL team of their generation had they gone on to win. In a 2018 retrospective, "Sports Illustrated" called the 1998 Vikings "The Greatest Team Never to Make It."

The loss had a dramatic effect on Minnesota sports culture, as the 1998 Vikings were considered the team most likely to deliver a Super Bowl championship to a franchise that had already suffered multiple heartbreaking defeats. Numerous publications have noted the influence that the loss had on the Vikings fan base; <a href="Brian%20Billick">Brian Billick</a>, the <a href="offensive%20coordinator">offensive coordinator</a> of the 1998 Vikings, went as far as stating, "I’m not sure the city had ever rebounded from it." <a href="Damon%20Amendolara">Damon Amendolara</a> of CBS Radio and Don Banks of "Sports Illustrated" both consider the Vikings' loss in the championship game as one of the most devastating in NFL history, with Banks noting that, "The Vikings have never completely recovered from that game." This perception has also extended into popular culture, as the game became a plot point in the episode "<a href="Little%20Minnesota">Little Minnesota</a>" of the television show "<a href="How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Mother">How I Met Your Mother</a>" when <a href="Robin%20Scherbatsky">Robin</a>, a Canadian character, asks the significance of a banner in a <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>-themed bar that reads, "I'm drinking till I forget the 1999 NFC Championship."

Gary Anderson's missed kick has been singled out as the main contributing factor to the Vikings' loss, as the Falcons were able to capitalize on the late shift in momentum produced by an unexpected opportunity to tie and eventually win the game. Considering this impact on the game's outcome and the historic performances of Anderson and the 1998 Vikings team, the miss has since been noted as a memorable moment in the greater history of the NFL. <a href="Paul%20Allen%20%28sports%20commentator%29">Paul Allen</a>, the play-by-play radio announcer for the Vikings, and Dan Barreiro both consider the miss as one of the most devastating moments in the history of Minnesota sports. According to <a href="Chad%20Hartman">Chad Hartman</a>, another sports radio host based in Minneapolis, "[Anderson] will always be known as the guy who was a part of screwing up the Vikings' trip to the Super Bowl, even though he had this magnificent season." ESPN voted the miss as the most memorable play in Vikings history, and ESPN contributor Ben Goessling believes that the miss influenced misfortunes that the franchise faced in subsequent years, including three further NFC Championship losses in <a href="2000%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season">2000</a>, <a href="2009%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season">2009</a>, and <a href="2017%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season">2017</a>. Cunningham concurred by claiming, "With that kick, it just seemed like the whole franchise went wide left."

Anderson has claimed that in greater context, the miss was not particularly notable, and it is only remembered because the Falcons won the game. Buchanan, who was attempting to block Anderson's kick, believes that Anderson would not have been able to convert the field goal regardless, since if the kick was on target, it would have "hit [Buchanan] in the face mask." Vikings backup quarterback <a href="Brad%20Johnson%20%28American%20football%29">Brad Johnson</a> echoed this sentiment, stating, "I think someone got loose on the left end and they almost blocked it, and [Anderson] tried to slice it in there." Some sportswriters, as well as Randle, have defended Anderson, claiming that the Vikings' defense deserves the real blame for the loss for allowing Atlanta to tie the game after Anderson's miss. Barreiro also criticized the performance of Cunningham, whom he felt did not handle the pressure of the game well and called "dreadful down the stretch".

Vikings coach Dennis Green has been criticized for his decision to kneel on 3rd down and play for overtime instead of attempting to score before the end of regulation. <a href="Radio%20personality">Radio host</a> Bob Sansevere, author of "The Best Minnesota Sports Arguments", called it "one of the all-time boneheaded decisions a coach has ever made in any sport". Of Green's play call, <a href="Peter%20King%20%28sportswriter%29">Peter King</a> of "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" wrote, "Minnesota coach Dennis Green did a great job this year, but if he doesn't wake up and stare at the ceiling in the next few days and say out loud: 'Boy, I screwed that one up,' then he's not being honest with himself." Nonetheless, local Minneapolis newspaper "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>" has contended that taking a knee was the correct decision due to the performance of the Vikings' offense, whose struggles that day were also noted by Carter.

The Falcons missed the playoffs the <a href="1999%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">following season</a> and would not return until <a href="2002%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">2002</a>. Following the <a href="2001%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">2001 season</a>, Chandler was released by the team, and Jamal Anderson retired due to a knee injury. The franchise would not reach the Super Bowl again until the <a href="2016%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">2016 season</a>, when they lost in overtime to the New England Patriots, 34–28. As a result, their win in the 1998 NFC Championship game stood as the franchise's proudest moment for years, particularly due to the atmosphere of pessimism that surrounded the franchise at the time. An <a href="NFL%20Films">NFL Films</a> retrospective on the Falcons' season noted that "years of pain were wiped away in one unforgettable afternoon," and Dan Weiner stated that, "The <a href="1998%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">1998 season</a> was a dream come true ... For once, the Atlanta Falcons made believers of us all." In 2010, ESPN named the 1998 team as the greatest Falcons team of all-time, and the network also voted Morton Andersen's game-winning field goal as the top play in Falcons' history.

Falcons coach Dan Reeves was praised for his ability to lead the team after having heart surgery only weeks prior, as Reeves' comeback proved to be an emotional rallying point for the team. Austin Murphy of "Sports Illustrated" noted that Reeves' return "[galvanized] the already close-knit Falcons", and Falcons linebacker <a href="Jessie%20Tuggle">Jessie Tuggle</a> agreed: "Dan has really inspired us all. ... He walked in the meeting room four days after having had surgery, and you could have heard a pin drop. We wanted to hear every last word he had to say." Reeves described his time during the season as "more rewarding than any other teams I've been involved in", and to Falcons <a href="American%20football%20positions%23Special_teams">special teams</a> coach <a href="Joe%20DeCamillis">Joe DeCamillis</a>, Reeves' leadership that season was "his best coaching job ever". <a href="CBS">CBS</a> called Reeves' return "an amazing comeback that people will be talking about for years".

Chandler was considered to be the offensive hero of the game, despite the attention that the Vikings' offense received during the season. Media analysis before the game noted that the Vikings' defense needed to focus on shutting down Falcons running back Jamal Anderson; feeling overlooked, Chandler used the coverage as extra motivation. In a retrospective for the website "<a href="Dan%20Abrams%23SportsGrid">SportsGrid</a>", Geoff Magliocchetti detailed the end of the game, in which he claims that Chandler "embarked on the drive of his life, an 8-play, 71-yard masterpiece, finding Mathis from 16 yards out for the tying score."

In the hours before the AFC Championship Game, the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> were watching the NFC Championship Game on the <a href="JumboTron">JumboTron</a> at <a href="Mile%20High%20Stadium">Mile High Stadium</a> to see who they would play in Super Bowl XXXIII should they defeat the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>. Broncos head coach <a href="Mike%20Shanahan">Mike Shanahan</a> expressed surprise at Anderson's missed kick, and running back <a href="Terrell%20Davis">Terrell Davis</a> said that the Falcons' subsequent victory put the Broncos in the mindset that they had "won the Super Bowl already," as their greatest potential challenge had been eliminated. This distraction nearly cost the Broncos the game against the Jets, as the Broncos played a very poor game. Tim Connolly, the Vikings team president at the time, recalled that Shanahan insinuated relief that the Broncos were not playing the Vikings when the two met at a reception after the conference championship games.

Two weeks later in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, <a href="John%20Elway">John Elway</a>. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the <a href="1992%20NFL%20season">1992 NFL season</a>. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, "These last three years have been hell. I know I would not have been back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." Reeves responded by saying, "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an <a href="assistant%20coach">assistant coach</a> on the team, and these points of contention became a <a href="sports%20journalism">media</a> storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.

The Falcons lost Super Bowl XXXIII by a score of 34–19, which earned the Broncos their second consecutive Super Bowl victory. The game was anticipated as a match up between the Vikings and the Broncos, and the Falcons' presence in the game was noted as an anticlimax. The night before the game, safety Eugene Robinson was arrested for soliciting a prostitute. Although Robinson played in the game, the distraction contributed to a poor performance by the Falcons team, who managed only six points in six drives deep into Denver territory and surrendered a season-high point total.

Cyclone Althea

Severe Tropical Cyclone Althea was a powerful <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that devastated parts of <a href="North%20Queensland">North Queensland</a> just before Christmas 1971. One of the strongest storms ever to affect the <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville</a> area, Althea was the fourth system and second severe tropical cyclone of the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Australian%20region%20cyclone%20season">1971–72 Australian region cyclone season</a>. After forming near the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> on 19 December and heading southwest across the <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a>, the storm reached its peak intensity with 10-minute average <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of 165 km/h (105 mph) – Category 4 on the <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">Australian cyclone scale</a>. At 09:00 <a href="Time%20in%20Australia">AEST</a> on Christmas Eve, Althea struck the coast of Queensland near <a href="Rollingstone%2C%20Queensland">Rollingstone</a>, about north of Townsville. Although early <a href="weather%20satellite">weather satellite</a>s provided only occasional glimpses into the cyclone's formative stages, its <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> was monitored closely by land-based <a href="weather%20radar">radar</a> that depicted an ongoing <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a>. Althea produced copious rainfall over central and western Queensland as it turned toward the southeast, and on 26 December the cyclone emerged over open waters. After briefly re-intensifying, the system dissipated on 29 December.

While moving ashore, Althea generated wind gusts as high as that wrought significant destruction around Townsville and left nearby <a href="Magnetic%20Island">Magnetic Island</a> in a state of ruin; almost all of the buildings on the island were damaged to some degree. A significant <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> battered the mainland, while high <a href="wind%20wave">waves</a> destroyed roads and <a href="seawall">seawall</a>s. Beaches receded by up to due to <a href="coastal%20erosion">coastal erosion</a>. In Townsville, thousands of homes were damaged and many were destroyed. The most widespread damage was to roofs, which were often poorly or not at all secured. The damage from Althea prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide <a href="building%20code">building code</a>s, requiring new homes to be cyclone-resistant. Townsville was the first community to adopt the enhanced construction standards. In addition to the coastal effects, Althea triggered extensive river flooding in interior Queensland. Most major roads in western portions of the state were cut off by floodwaters, and hundreds of families had to leave their homes for higher ground. In the aftermath of the cyclone, 600 <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> soldiers aided recovery efforts in Townsville and Magnetic Island, while both state and federal governments contributed disaster relief funds. Three people were killed and damage totaled $120 million (1971 <a href="Australian%20Dollar">AUD</a>).

Cyclone Althea originated in an expanding area of thunderstorm activity near the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> in mid-December 1971. Although little is known about the storm's genesis because of sparse reports and infrequent <a href="weather%20satellite">weather satellite</a> images, the disturbance is thought to have organised into a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Intensity%20classifications">tropical low</a> on 19 December as it tracked slowly southwestward into the <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a>. According to the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Meteorology">Bureau of Meteorology</a>'s (BoM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, the system reached tropical cyclone status around 06:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> on 20 December, less than southwest of <a href="Honiara">Honiara</a>. Just after 23:00 UTC on 21 December, imagery from the United States <a href="ESSA-8">ESSA-8</a> satellite showed the first indications of an emerging <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye feature</a>. Althea tracked southwest toward the coast of Queensland around a subtropical <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to the south, and steadily strengthened. Near 18:00 UTC on 22 December, it reached its peak intensity with 10-minute <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of 165 km/h (105 mph); this made it a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">Australian scale</a>. The cyclone's central barometric pressure of was estimated using the lowest recorded air pressure, at <a href="Townsville%20Airport">Townsville Airport</a>, a <a href="radius%20of%20maximum%20wind">radius of maximum wind</a>, and environmental air pressures.
Late on 22 December, the eye remained obscured to satellite imagery by a <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">canopy of cirrus clouds</a> while the cyclone passed north of <a href="Lihou%20Reef%20National%20Nature%20Reserve">Lihou Reef</a>. Early the next day, it tracked just south of the automated weather station on Flinders Reef. Althea likely continued to organise until <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a>, which occurred at 23:00 UTC on 23 December – 09:00 <a href="Time%20in%20Australia">AEST</a> on <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a> – near <a href="Rollingstone%2C%20Queensland">Rollingstone</a>, about north of <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>. The landfall point placed Townsville and nearby <a href="Magnetic%20Island">Magnetic Island</a> in the cyclone's powerful left-front quadrant. Because of the tight pressure gradient between Althea and the <a href="high%20pressure%20area">high pressure area</a> to the south, <a href="Beaufort%20scale">gale-force</a> winds extended well to the south of the cyclone's centre. While the system was moving ashore, land-based radar imagery identified an ongoing <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a>, with two distinct, concentric <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eyewalls</a> – rings of intense thunderstorms surrounding the centre. The strongest winds were found under the contracting outer ring, which shrank from between 21:00 and 23:00 UTC to become the dominant eyewall as the inner ring dissipated. Consequently, extreme winds initially extended relatively far from the centre.

The storm quickly weakened as it continued southwest, passing just north of <a href="Charters%20Towers%20City%2C%20Queensland">Charters Towers City</a>, though it continued to produce heavy rainfall over interior Queensland. Curving southeastward, Althea re-emerged over open waters between <a href="Maryborough%2C%20Queensland">Maryborough</a> and <a href="Double%20Island%20Point">Double Island Point</a> on 26 December and began to intensify once again. At 00:00 UTC on 28 December, the cyclone reached a third peak with 10-minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), but as it turned more toward the south, increasingly cooler <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s weakened the cyclone. On 29 December, Althea lost its tropical characteristics over the <a href="Tasman%20Sea">Tasman Sea</a>.

In the hours leading up to landfall, the TCWC in Brisbane issued 17 cyclone warnings for coastal areas. According to the BoM, residents received 20 hours of advance warning in which to complete preparations. By late on 23 December, police and <a href="Queensland%20State%20Emergency%20Service">state emergency service</a> workers were on alert for the approaching storm. High public preparedness and a relatively low loss of life were attributed to BoM cyclone awareness initiatives in the wake of 1970's deadly <a href="Cyclone%20Ada">Cyclone Ada</a>. However, storm victims still criticised the agency and local radio news stations for unclear, untimely, or conflicting broadcasts that caused widespread confusion. Significant delays between the issuance of warnings from TCWC Brisbane and local broadcast in the Townsville area raised some question about the need for a warning centre closer to <a href="North%20Queensland">North Queensland</a>.

Total damage from Cyclone Althea amounted to just under <a href="Australian%20dollar">A</a>$120 million (1971), and the normalised damage total for 2012, which accounts for growth and inflation, was estimated at $648 million. Throughout the affected region, 257 people were treated for storm-related injuries, mostly inflicted by airborne debris; three people were killed. In Townsville, ten people were reported missing during the cyclone: nine on three boats that were unaccounted for, and one whose car was found in a swollen creek. They were all found safe.

An estimated 90% of the buildings on <a href="Magnetic%20Island">Magnetic Island</a> were damaged to some degree by wind gusts, and there was "not a tree left with leaves on it". The island's main town of <a href="Picnic%20Bay%2C%20Queensland">Picnic Bay</a> was hit particularly hard. About 100 people endured the cyclone in the dining room of a Picnic Bay hotel that ultimately sustained severe structural damage; 65 would remain sheltered there through Christmas Day. Around 60% of houses in <a href="Nelly%20Bay%2C%20Queensland">Nelly Bay</a> and 40% in <a href="Arcadia%2C%20Queensland">Arcadia</a> were demolished. In the village of <a href="Horseshoe%20Bay%2C%20Queensland">Horseshoe Bay</a>, one woman died in a building collapse, and reportedly only 8 out of 150 houses in the community survived the cyclone. The island suffered a nearly total power outage, and after the water pipeline from the mainland was damaged, strict usage rations were put in place until repairs could be made. About 30 people on Magnetic Island were treated for injuries sustained during the storm, and damage reached $2 million.

At the time, Althea was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to strike the coast of Queensland; it still stands as the most intense ever in the Townsville area. Gusts as high as and sustained winds of were recorded at Townsville Airport, though the <a href="anemometer">anemometer</a> was somewhat sheltered by upwind <a href="Castle%20Hill%2C%20Queensland">Castle Hill</a>, so stronger winds may have occurred. The storm bent large steel utility poles and lifted houses off their foundations, while entirely stripping trees of their leaves. Dislodged debris acted as projectiles, penetrating <a href="fibre%20cement">fibre cement</a> walls. In some cases, entire roofs crashed down on vehicles and other property. Power outages were extensive. One post-storm survey of 6,000 houses in Townsville found around 0.7% totally demolished, 1.7% with critical but repairable damage, and 13.3% with minor damage. Other estimates placed the share of damaged or destroyed houses at 60%. Several months after the storm, the <a href="Townsville%20City%20Council">Townsville City Council</a> reported that about 200 houses had been leveled – about 1 in every 100 – with 600 more rendered uninhabitable, and as many as 4,000 damaged. Among the structures damaged or destroyed were 200 <a href="Queensland%20Housing%20Commission">Queensland Housing Commission</a> homes and roughly 500 of the 700 <a href="War%20Service%20Homes%20Commission">War Service Homes Commission</a> dwellings in Townsville. Overall, Althea wrought at least $6 million in damage to government-owned buildings. The cyclone killed two people in Townsville: one man was crushed when his home collapsed, and another suffered a stress-related heart attack.

Although the worst of the storm struck near low tide, the combination of a large <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> and high waves caused widespread damage along the coast. Storm surge values reached in Townsville Harbour; the <a href="Ross%20River%20%28Queensland%29">Ross River</a> experienced a water level rise that submerged streets in the city. Shipping interests in the river suffered extensively when a barge broke free of its moorings and collided with numerous smaller vessels. An estimated peak storm surge of occurred at <a href="Toolakea%2C%20Queensland">Toolakea</a>. In addition to the surge, wave action was highly destructive. <a href="Seawall">Seawall</a>s and coastal roadways were crushed by the pounding surf in places such as the <a href="the%20Strand%2C%20Townsville">Strand</a> and <a href="Cape%20Pallarenda">Cape Pallarenda</a>. The violent onshore flow generated severe <a href="beach%20erosion">beach erosion</a> from Townsville to Toolakea, while north of the storm's center, in the <a href="Great%20Palm%20Island">Greater Palm group</a> of islands, substantial erosion resulted from southwesterly winds. Beaches receded by as much as between Pallarenda and <a href="Rowes%20Bay%2C%20Queensland">Rowes Bay</a>, and by up to at <a href="Balgal%20Beach%2C%20Queensland">Balgal Beach</a> near the cyclone's landfall point. Storm surge values tapered off sharply to the north of the storm centre, but remained high well to the south, with above-normal water levels extending as far south as <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay</a>.

At <a href="Pallarenda">Pallarenda</a>, the storm surge swept vehicles off roads and inundated homes; around 40% of dwellings were rendered uninhabitable. Trees and power lines in the community were mangled, nearly every building was unroofed, and damage amounted to approximately $1 million. In <a href="Saunders%20Beach%2C%20Queensland">Saunders Beach</a>, wind-blown sand debarked trees and buffeted paint from houses. Althea generally dropped of rain in the Townsville area, much of it falling after the cyclone moved inland. As so many roofs had been damaged, many home interiors were left exposed to the elements. As a result, the deluge caused significant water damage to interior walls, electrical wiring, and personal belongings. Storage facilities at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">RAAF Garbutt</a> were seriously damaged by the combined wind and rain, and four helicopters at the base were destroyed. In the weeks following the cyclone's passage, further downpours plagued Townsville and triggered flooding when storm drains clogged with debris were unable to handle the runoff. Severe flooding from Althea in the <a href="Burdekin%20River">Burdekin River</a> delta was exacerbated by rainfall from <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Australian%20region%20cyclone%20season%23Tropical%20Cyclone%20Bronwyn">Cyclone Bronwyn</a> in early January.

Farther inland, up to of rain fell in 12 hours, the most substantial rainfall in 15 years. In some drought-stricken parts of the state, the rain proved beneficial to farmers, but there was also widespread <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>ing over western and southern Queensland. Numerous communities were isolated by rising floodwaters, and hundreds of families were forced to evacuate their homes. In some cases, residents had to be moved to higher ground by boat, along with any food and provisions they were able to salvage. The overflowing <a href="Warrego%20River">Warrego River</a> washed out parts of the <a href="Mitchell%20Highway">Mitchell</a> and <a href="Warrego%20Highway">Warrego</a> highways near <a href="Charleville%2C%20Queensland">Charleville</a>, and most of the major roads in western portions of the state were blocked by flooding. Several hundred homes in <a href="South%20West%20Queensland">South West Queensland</a> were inundated. In addition to damaging highways, the cyclone disrupted rail and air transportation. Railroads traveling out of Townsville were submerged under as much as of water, while several airfields were forced to close. Later, as the storm approached open water once again, it dropped over of precipitation along the southern coast of Queensland. As <a href="surface%20runoff">runoff</a> from the heavy rains traveled downstream, southern areas continued to experience flooding into early January. Two <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es embedded within the cyclone's outer bands touched down in <a href="Bowen%2C%20Queensland">Bowen</a>, causing damage to buildings and vegetation. Damaging thunderstorms in the suburbs of <a href="Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Sydney, New South Wales</a>, on 25 December were broadly attributed to the weather pattern associated with Althea.

A <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> was declared for the Townsville area, making an initial $7,000 in emergency aid available for distribution among 84 individuals left homeless. Immediately after the storm, the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> began collecting and distributing donated clothing, while providing hot meals to hundreds of destitute storm victims. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Australian Prime Minister</a> <a href="William%20McMahon">William McMahon</a> soon traveled to Townsville to assess the damage and authorise the distribution of emergency grants for affected residents. At the end of December, officials announced that the state and federal governments would jointly issue individual rebuilding grants, ranging from $1,000 to as high as $4,000 for pensioners; for the latter, higher allocations to cover the full cost of rebuilding homes were soon considered. The Townsville City Council received a special $25,000 grant with the goal of repairing schools for the start of the new academic year. By 27 December, $150,000 in private donations had arrived as organisations and radio stations throughout Queensland sought assistance for the disaster area. <a href="Government%20of%20Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> provided $72,000 of relief funding, while <a href="Government%20of%20Tasmania">Tasmania</a> contributed $2,000. The <a href="Commonwealth%20Government">Australian federal government</a> reimbursed Queensland for an estimated $5.5–6 million spent by the state on recovery.

About 600 <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> soldiers, including 130 engineers, were recalled from Christmas leave and stationed at <a href="Lavarack%20Barracks">Lavarack Barracks</a> in Townsville for relief efforts around the area. The troops were then split into 30 crews and assigned to different parts of the disaster area. In response to a request by <a href="Premier%20of%20Queensland">Premier of Queensland</a> <a href="Joh%20Bjelke-Petersen">Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a>, the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a> spent 10 days on Magnetic Island assisting in cleanup and recovery. Emergency vehicles, specialised personnel, electric generators, refrigerators, food rations, and other critical supplies were ferried to the island, and medical officers rushed there to limit the spread of <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a> after several cases were reported. To recognise the efforts of the Australian Army in the aftermath of Althea, a commemorative plaque was later erected in Townsville's <a href="Anzac%20Memorial%20Park%2C%20Townsville">Anzac Memorial Park</a>. Initial recovery work was delayed by persistent flooding of roadways, but within a few days of the cyclone, residents received around 2,000 <a href="tarpaulin">tarpaulin</a>s to protect their damaged homes and building materials to begin repairs. By early January, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> had airlifted of emergency supplies into the Townsville area. Isolated instances of <a href="looting">looting</a> were reported after the disaster, and multiple local merchants were investigated for alleged <a href="price%20gouging">price gouging</a>. After the season ended, the name "Althea" was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Australian%20cyclone%20names%23Tropical%20Cyclone%20names%20retired%20in%20the%201970s">retired</a> from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list due to the cyclone's severe impact.

Many of the damaged houses were of poor construction, and in the wake of Althea, engineering studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural <a href="design%20load">design load</a>s necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof <a href="Cladding%20%28construction%29">cladding</a> and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin, Northern Territory</a>, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The <a href="James%20Cook%20University%23History">Cyclone Testing Station</a>, a wind damage research organisation housed within <a href="James%20Cook%20University">James Cook University</a>'s Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.Many of the lessons learned by emergency services in Townsville became the blueprint for preparation and response to <a href="Cyclone%20Tracey">Cyclone Tracey</a> in Darwin almost exactly a year later.

Pru (album)

Pru is the debut studio album by American singer <a href="Prudencesa%20Renfro">Pru</a>. It was released on November 7, 2000, through <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>. "Pru" was managed by Capitol Records executive Roy Lott, who had signed Pru to <a href="Warner/Chappell%20Music">Warner/Chappell Music Publishing</a> after being impressed by her songwriting and voice on a <a href="demo%20tape">demo tape</a>. Pru collaborated with Ben Garrison, the Characters, and Rick Williams on the album.

According to Lott, Pru was part of Capitol Records' attempts to attract a wider audience through her <a href="Crossover%20music">crossover appeal</a>. According to <a href="Music%20criticism">music critics</a>, the album encompasses several genres, with some commentators noting influences from <a href="neo%20soul">neo soul</a>. Pru also used poetry as an inspiration for writing music.

Reviews of the album were generally positive, singling out in particular its composition and Pru's voice. They also compared her favorably to contemporary artists. The album peaked at number 176 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, an achievement made possible in part by an intensive marketing strategy devised by Capitol Records executives. Two singles"Candles" and "Aaroma (of a Man)" were released to positive reviews. "Candles" peaked at number 68 on the <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> chart.

American singer <a href="Prudencesa%20Renfro">Prudencesa Renfro</a>, professionally known as Pru, was signed through <a href="Warner/Chappell%20Music">Warner/Chappell Music Publishing</a> by <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>' executive Roy Lott, who said that he was "drawn to" her songwriting and voice. Jack Ponti, of Cazzy Dog Management, had helped Pru produce a <a href="demo%20tape">demo tape</a> to secure the record deal. Lott had noted Pru's potential as an artist through her lyrics. He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album "Pru". 

Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as <a href="Cassandra%20Wilson">Cassandra Wilson</a> and <a href="Dianne%20Reeves">Dianne Reeves</a>. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then <a href="Texas%20Southern%20University">Texas Southern University</a>, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="Rachelle%20Ferrell">Rachelle Ferrell</a>, <a href="Sade%20%28band%29">Sade</a>, <a href="Naughty%20by%20Nature">Naughty by Nature</a>, <a href="the%20Isley%20Brothers">the Isley Brothers</a>, and <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: "From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis." She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track "Hazy Shades" as an example of a poem turned into a song.

Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">contemporary R&B</a>, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio. On her official website, the singer identified her style as connected with the soul. Though <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> gives the singer songwriting credit on twelve of the tracks, Pru is only credited for co-writing "Aaroma" on the album's liner notes. The record was completed at Studio57 and Weight Room in New York City, with <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixing</a> handled by <a href="Mike%20Shipley">Mike Shipley</a> and <a href="Tony%20Maserati">Tony Maserati</a>. Following release of the album, Pru spoke highly of her experiences with the producers and felt that they "la[id] a good bed around the lyrics and the melodies".

"Pru" comprises thirteen songs, among which <a href="Music%20criticism">music critics</a> identified several different musical genres. "<a href="Tucson%20Weekly">Tucson Weekly</a>"'s Margaret Regan wrote that Pru's material was an example of <a href="New%20Age%20music">new age music</a>, while Janine Coveney of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" called the singer's sound as "alterna-soul/pop music". AllMusic's Ed Hogan noted that the songs combined <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin music</a>, contemporary R&B, <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, and <a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a>.

Pru called the opening track, "Prophecy of a Flower", the album's focal point, saying that "everything else falls a little to the left and to the right of that". The R&B and <a href="Soul%20music">soul</a> song's lyrics incorporate words from the <a href="he%20loves%20me...%20he%20loves%20me%20not">he loves me... he loves me not</a> game. The second track, "183 Miles", combines hip hop and <a href="country%20music">country music</a>, its lyrics revolving around a love story. Sampling <a href="the%20Miracles">the Miracles</a>' 1965 song "<a href="The%20Tracks%20of%20My%20Tears">The Tracks of My Tears</a>", "Candles" is a "midtempo <a href="Groove%20%28music%29">groove</a>" that features the titular object, candles, as a metaphor for "stress (burned at both ends) and healing (lit for meditation)". The Miracles' single was a direct inspiration for the lyrics and instrumentation on the track. Hogan, however, saw "Candles" as diverging from the song's message.

Coveney described "Aaroma", the fourth track, as offering a "sexy challenge" to the listener. Pru adapted one of the song's lyrics, "If a man came my way and I didn't doubt him", from one of her poems. While discussing the meaning of the title, the singer said it derived from an "old <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southern</a> saying: 'I could smell you coming'". "Hazy Shade" is a <a href="ballad">ballad</a> that Hogan described as "recall[ing] 'blue light in the basement' old skool <a href="slow%20jam">slow jam</a>s". Preceded by "Salsa Interlude", Pru's cover of Sade's 1984 single "<a href="Smooth%20Operator">Smooth Operator</a>" features a stronger Latin-inspired instrumental than the original. Hogan noted that the song included "popping percussion and fluttery flute runs". The ending of the ninth track, "Can't Compare Your Love", takes inspiration from <a href="spoken%20word">spoken word</a> performances, and the following song ,"Sketches of Pain", deliberately plays with the title of <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>' 1960 album "<a href="Sketches%20of%20Spain">Sketches of Spain</a>". Colin Ross of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" described the twelfth track, "What They Gone Do?", as featuring a "brassy <a href="Two-step%20%28dance%20move%29">two-step</a>" in its instrumentation.

On August 19, 2000, "Pru" was first announced as an untitled album scheduled for release the following month. Pushed back to October 24, 2000, the album was developed under the working title "Inside A Poem"a reference to Pru's poetic style of songwriting. Retitled "Pru", Capitol Records released the record on November 7, 2000, as an <a href="Compact%20disc">audio CD</a>, <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a>, and <a href="Music%20download">digital download</a>. It was also made available as an "enhanced audio CD", which contains <a href="multimedia">multimedia</a> computer files and a video entitled "In the Life of Pru".

Prior to the album's release, Pru performed with a band that included members of <a href="the%20Family%20Stand">the Family Stand</a> at the Los Angeles venue Luna Park and the New York City club S.O.B. She sang later in Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta to promote the album further. Pru also toured with the Family Stand and members of Sade. While discussing the album's promotion, Linton said: "Pru is a live performance artist and, being new, we wanted people to get their first impression of her in that environment". 

According to "Billboard" magazine, Capitol Records had placed significant focus on the marketing for the album, including the release of an electronic press kit and promotion through "non-retail accounts". Lott told "Billboard" magazine that Pru would act as a primary part of Capitol Records' attempt to attract a wider audience with her <a href="Crossover%20music">crossover appeal</a>. David Linton, Capitol Records' senior vice president of R&B promotion and marketing, identified R&B, <a href="adult%20contemporary%20music">adult contemporary music</a>, and <a href="Top%2040">top 40 music</a> as potential markets for the singer. 

Released as the lead single from "Pru", "Candles" was sent to <a href="Rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic</a> radio stations in the United States during the first week of September. Lott said the song was chosen as Pru's debut single as he felt that its allusions to the Miracles' song would appeal to listeners of all ages. It was further promoted by its inclusion on a back-to-school CD sampler from retailer <a href="Delia%27s">Delia's</a>. Director <a href="Dave%20Meyers%20%28director%29">Dave Meyers</a> shot the accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, which was released on November 25, 2000. The video premiered on <a href="MTV">MTV</a> in February 2001, following roughly two months of rotation on <a href="BET">BET</a>. "Candles" reached number 68 on the <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> "Billboard" chart where it spent fourteen weeks, and peaked at number 65 on the <a href="R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Airplay">R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay</a> "Billboard" chart where it spent ten weeks. For both chart appearances, "Billboard" credited the song as appearing on "The Sound of Style: Capital Records Fall 2000 Collection". Critical response to "Candles" was positive. David Dickinson, a music director at <a href="WHUR-FM">WHUR-FM</a>, felt the single would be appropriate for radio and praised its production and Pru's voice. A writer from "Billboard" magazine complimented the lyrics and Pru's vocal performance, contrasting the artist's "cool, literate sensibility [against] the blatant sexual overtones" from other contemporary R&B female singers, but expressed doubt that hip-hop and mainstream R&B stations would play the song, seeing it as better suited for adult R&B radio.

"Aaroma" was released as the album's second single under the modified title "Aaroma (of a Man)". A writer from "Billboard" magazine compared its lyrics positively to those in <a href="Toni%20Braxton">Toni Braxton</a>'s "<a href="Un-Break%20My%20Heart">Un-Break My Heart</a>" (1996). Another reviewer from the same publication singled out the track as one of the best from the album. According to a "Billboard" article published on June 16, 2001, <a href="Dance%20music">dance</a> and R&B remixes of the song were commissioned from Hani al-Badir and Carlos "Six July" Broady, respectively; the remixes were scheduled to be added to a re-release of the album. A music video for the single was filmed in June 2001. The song was also featured on the <a href="EMI">EMI</a>-released album "Celebrating Black Music Sampler 2001". Along with the two singles "Candles" and "Aaroma (of a Man)", the record was promoted as featuring "Smooth Operator" and "183 Miles".

Upon its release, "Pru" received positive feedback from music critics. Ed Hogan praised Pru's experimentation with musical genres. In discussing its many influences, Colin Ross wrote that the album never sounded uneven or disjointed. He commended the singer for communicating a range of emotions, by turns seeming "innocent, self-assured, uncertain, elated and vulnerable", praising in particular the album's instrumentation and lyrics. A "Billboard" writer described "Pru" as "sparkl[ing] with colorfully imaged songs about love won, lost and anticipated". "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"'s Steve Jones praised the performer for the "remarkable depth in her poetics about joy and heartbreak". Jones wrote that the album demonstrated that Pru had a clear sense of what she wanted to achieve for her career and sound. <a href="Ebony%20%28magazine%29">"Ebony"</a>s Lynn Norment described her as possessing a "rich, earthy voice and lyrical talent", responding positively to the artist's influences from scripture and poetry. A writer for "<a href="Sister%202%20Sister">Sister 2 Sister</a>" commended Pru for her ability to convey emotion to the listener, and identified "Prophecy of a Flower" as their favorite track from the album. The <a href="Houston%20Press">"Houston Press"</a>' Craig D. Lindsey praised Pru's music and live performances, describing her songs as "soulful, earthy and organic" and the antithesis to music such as <a href="Destiny%27s%20Child">Destiny's Child</a>'s 1999 single "<a href="Bills%2C%20Bills%2C%20Bills">Bills, Bills, Bills</a>". The album was called "[a]rtful ... stunning ... sexy" by a reviewer from "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>".

Several media outlets compared Pru to other artists, with a "Billboard" reviewer attributing the singer as writing in the same style as contemporary neo soul performers. The singer's voice was compared to <a href="Lauryn%20Hill">Lauryn Hill</a>, <a href="Macy%20Gray">Macy Gray</a>, and <a href="Erykah%20Badu">Erykah Badu</a> by AllMusic's Stacia Proefrock. She was classified as part of an "emerging school of poetics" by Ross, who said that she was "subtly changing the landscape of contemporary R&B lyricism". A "Billboard" reviewer also placed the singer as a member of "the new soul movement", and compared her work to that of <a href="Angie%20Stone">Angie Stone</a>, <a href="Amel%20Larrieux">Amel Larrieux</a>, <a href="Jill%20Scott">Jill Scott</a>, and Badu. A writer from the journal "Today's Black Woman" saw Pru as part of the neo soul genre along with Badu and Scott, saying that these singers incorporated in their music "traditional R&B as well as its new millennium, hip-hop inspired modern counterpart". Pru responded positively to the comparisons, saying: "What I think is being classified as the neo-soul classic movement has artists that are individually different in their own right, but aren't different from modern R&B."

"Pru" reached a peak position of number 176 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, spending two weeks on the chart, and peaked on "Billboard's" <a href="Top%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Albums">R&B Albums</a> at number 38, leaving the chart after thirty-two weeks.

The Bill (Inside No. 9)

"The Bill" is the second episode of the third series of the British <a href="dark%20comedy">dark comedy</a> <a href="anthology%20series">anthology</a> television programme "<a href="Inside%20No.%209">Inside No. 9</a>". It first aired on 21 February 2017, on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>. The episode was written by <a href="Reece%20Shearsmith">Reece Shearsmith</a> and <a href="Steve%20Pemberton">Steve Pemberton</a>, and was directed by <a href="Guillem%20Morales">Guillem Morales</a>. "The Bill" focuses on four men—Archie, Malcolm, Kevin, and Craig—arguing over who should pay the bill in a restaurant at closing time, much to the dismay of the waitress Anya. It addresses themes of <a href="masculinity">masculinity</a> and <a href="competition">competition</a>, and the <a href="North%E2%80%93South%20divide%20%28England%29">English north/south divide</a> is a recurring issue; Craig, the visiting southerner, is wealthier than the other three, and unfamiliar with some of their terminology.

The episode was inspired by a real dispute seen by the writers, and also influenced by <a href="Yasmina%20Reza">Yasmina Reza</a>'s play "<a href="Art%20%28play%29">'Art'</a>". "The Bill" starred Pemberton as Malcolm, Shearsmith as Archie, <a href="Jason%20Watkins%20%28actor%29">Jason Watkins</a> as Kevin, <a href="Philip%20Glenister">Philip Glenister</a> as Craig, and Ellie White as Anya. Callum Coates played Tim, who appears in the episode's final scene. Though set in northern England, the episode was filmed in a <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a> restaurant. Commentators compared the episode to the television series "<a href="Hustle%20%28TV%20series%29">Hustle</a>", the work of the director <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>—including his 1992 film "<a href="Reservoir%20Dogs">Reservoir Dogs</a>"—and <a href="Roald%20Dahl">Roald Dahl</a>'s 1948 short story "<a href="Man%20from%20the%20South">Man from the South</a>", which was adapted for both the television series "<a href="Tales%20of%20the%20Unexpected%20%28TV%20series%29">Tales of the Unexpected</a>" and the 1995 anthology film "<a href="Four%20Rooms">Four Rooms</a>".

Critics responded positively to "The Bill", praising its humour, direction and acting. Glenister, Watkins, and White were all singled out for particularly compelling performances. Despite considerable praise for the writing and timing, some commentators questioned the effectiveness of a <a href="twist%20%28narrative%29">twist</a> in the closing minutes, several criticising the final scene. "The Bill" won Shearsmith and Pemberton the Best TV Situation Comedy award at the <a href="Writers%27%20Guild%20of%20Great%20Britain">2018 Writers' Guild Awards</a>.

The second series of "<a href="Inside%20No.%209">Inside No. 9</a>" aired from 26 March 2015 to 29 April 2015, and in October the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> confirmed a third series. Further information, including hints at settings and confirmed performers, was released in January 2016, around which time the series was filmed. "<a href="The%20Devil%20of%20Christmas">The Devil of Christmas</a>", the first episode of this third series, was shown as a <a href="Christmas%20special">Christmas special</a> on 26 December 2016 on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>. "The Bill", the second episode of the third series and the first of a run of five episodes, followed a few months later, on 21 February 2017.

Inspiration for "The Bill" came when Shearsmith and Pemberton, the creators of "Inside No. 9", saw a group arguing over a bill at a <a href="Muswell%20Hill">Muswell Hill</a> restaurant. The writers had an office in the area, and had lunch at the same restaurant every day while writing the programme's third series. The group was made up of three older people: two women and a man. Pemberton said that, unexpectedly, "they were arguing about wanting to pay it, and we just came out and thought, 'Could that be one episode?' ... And then it's about sustaining that one idea". For him, "when you're in the writing phase, you can see anything in day-to-day life that could spark your imagination"; after seeing this dispute, the writers immediately returned to their office to begin writing. Another inspiration, according to Shearsmith, was <a href="Yasmina%20Reza">Yasmina Reza</a>'s play "<a href="Art%20%28play%29">'Art'</a>", which, like "The Bill", involves escalating arguments between friends. <a href="Richard%20Bean">Richard Bean</a>'s stage version of the 1987 film "<a href="House%20of%20Games">House of Games</a>", meanwhile, was identified by Shearsmith as sharing an "intensity" with the more violent moments of "The Bill".

Much of the script was originally written prior to the decision to include the <a href="twist%20%28narrative%29">twists</a> in the episode's closing minutes, and some parts that were written were not filmed. This included the characters playing a word-based <a href="drinking%20game">drinking game</a> with <a href="limoncello">limoncello</a>. Limoncello remained a part of the narrative, however, and formed the basis of a joke that was one of Shearsmith's favourites from the series: a quip that the thickly accented waitress was likely to bring a lemon and a cello rather than glasses of limoncello. For Pemberton and Shearsmith, the episode was particularly <a href="claustrophobic">claustrophobic</a>, and, in this sense, it mirrored "<a href="Sardines%20%28Inside%20No.%209%29">Sardines</a>" and "<a href="La%20Couchette">La Couchette</a>", the first episodes of the first and second series of "Inside No. 9" respectively.

The episode was filmed in a restaurant/nightclub in <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a>, London. The location, which was close to Pemberton and Shearsmith's homes, was found by the "Inside No. 9" producer <a href="Adam%20Tandy">Adam Tandy</a>. "The Bill" is set in the north of England at night; this introduced particular filming challenges. Takes had to be re-shot or edited if a <a href="London%20bus">London bus</a> was visible out of the restaurant's windows, and some takes, including many of the character Craig (as his chair faced away from the restaurant's windows) could only be done later in the working day, otherwise daylight would be visible on-screen.

As each episode of "Inside No. 9" features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. "The Bill" starred Shearsmith as Archie, Pemberton as Malcolm, <a href="Jason%20Watkins%20%28actor%29">Jason Watkins</a> as Kevin, <a href="Philip%20Glenister">Philip Glenister</a> as Craig, Ellie White as Anya, and Callum Coates as Tim. For his role, Pemberton wore an <a href="Eddie%20Large">Eddie Large</a>-inspired wig, but had his own beard. He also wore padding to appear larger. Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith work hard to make roles attractive to accomplished actors, claiming that Glenister had hoped he would not like the script, looking for an excuse to turn down a week's work in his busy schedule. Pemberton and Glenister had known each other for many years prior to "The Bill"; they shared a mutual friend, and Glenister had appeared in productions for Pemberton's <a href="theatre%20company">theatre company</a> 606 Theatre. Glenister and Watkins, too, had worked together on a play read-through in the past. Prior to filming, Watkins had not met White, a less-well-known performer, who was sought out by Pemberton and Shearsmith due to her appearance in "People Time", an acclaimed <a href="pilot%20%28television%29">pilot</a> that was shown as part of <a href="BBC%20Three">BBC Three</a>'s "<a href="Comedy%20Feeds">Comedy Feeds</a>".

Watkins had previously starred in Shearsmith and Pemberton's black comedy television programme "<a href="Psychoville">Psychoville</a>"; the pair say that though they generally have a rule against "reusing" actors from "Psychoville" in "Inside No. 9", so as "to keep surprising and avoid familiarity", they broke it "because [Watkins is] brilliant". He was not the only actor for which the writers broke this rule. Performers were also reused in "<a href="The%20Trial%20of%20Elizabeth%20Gadge">The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge</a>" and "<a href="Cold%20Comfort%20%28Inside%20No.%209%29">Cold Comfort</a>", for example. Pemberton highlighted working with Watkins again as one of the highlights of the series. Watkins said he was attracted to "Inside No. 9" by the chance to work with Pemberton and Shearsmith again. He described the episode as "like a beautifully constructed little play for television" with "a great mix of characters and surprising plots". His character, meanwhile, he called "put-upon and pathetic and petty".

Anya closes a restaurant where four men—northerners Archie, Malcolm, and Kevin are entertaining Londoner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, but he and Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that "he" will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, Archie being unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin claims to be the poorest. Archie, Malcolm, and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. The dispute becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, and Malcolm reveals that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his "<a href="au%20pair">au pair</a>" for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. Archie reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable <a href="brain%20tumour">brain tumour</a>.

A distressed Malcolm leaves the table only to return furious; Archie was lying. A heated debate ensues, and the four men wrestle over the bill until Anya tells them that the meal can be free. Malcolm insists it is not about the bill, and fetches a knife and chopping board. Archie and Malcolm are to play <a href="Knife%20game">stabscotch</a>, with the winner paying. Malcolm is quick but Archie is slower, repeatedly stabbing himself. Craig pulls the knife from Archie, inadvertently slashing Anya's throat. She collapses as blood splatters. Anya is dead, and Malcolm formulates a story blaming Archie, but Archie has called a prison contact who will remove the body.

The clean-up will cost £200,000; it is needed tonight, in cash, meaning only Craig can pay. He calls his "au pair", but treads on Anya's hand, and she yells. Kevin declares the plan a failure; Archie, Malcolm, Kevin, and Anya had been <a href="Confidence%20trick">hustling</a> Craig. Kevin, now in control, demands Craig's phone. Craig refuses, but is locked in the restaurant. In a final scene, a waiter closes the restaurant while the hustlers ("Archie", "Malcolm", "Kevin", and "Anya") entertain the well-dressed Tim. "Archie" requests the bill, and "the waiter" is revealed to be Craig, who has joined the hustlers to satiate his cravings for excitement.

"The Bill" opens with the mundane image of men eating at a restaurant and arguing about the bill, but then, in the words of one critic, "takes that familiar scenario and pushes it to impressively baroque extremes". In a reversal of the norm, all diners want to pay the whole bill, rather than wanting to limit their payment. In this dispute, "The Bill" explores themes of <a href="masculinity">masculinity</a>, <a href="losing%20face">losing face</a>, <a href="competition">competitiveness</a>, <a href="passive%20aggression">passive aggression</a>, and rivalry. Andrew Billen, writing in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", compared this aspect of the episode to the television series "<a href="Mad%20Dogs%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Mad Dogs</a>", which had also starred Glenister; one critic suggested that Glenister's character in "Mad Dogs" and Craig in "The Bill" are similar. The characters tell "well-rehearsed anecdotes and blokey jokes", while Craig is "all flash-cash and inappropriate comments to the waitress". Pemberton's Malcolm, for Michael Hogan of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", "appeared to have wandered in" from a <a href="Mike%20Leigh">Mike Leigh</a> production; several critics commented on his striking <a href="hairpiece">hairpiece</a>. All four of the men are unpleasant people.

The <a href="North%E2%80%93South%20divide%20%28England%29">English north/south divide</a> is a key feature of the plot and humour, with many references to north/south <a href="caricature">caricature</a>s. Craig is unfamiliar with the <a href="English%20language%20in%20northern%20England">northern</a> phrases used by Archie, Malcolm and Kevin, including "diddlum", "piss-mints", and "bluecock" (a "tight-fisted wanker"). Craig is wealthier than the other characters, and mocks them with stereotypes about northerners as poor and stupid. For one critic, the significance of the north/south divide in the episode means that it could have been called "Revenge of the Northerners".

After the revelation in the closing minutes of "The Bill", the character of the episode changes. The biggest changes come about in Watkins's Kevin and White's Anya. Kevin changes from a timid <a href="penny%20pincher">penny pincher</a> referred to as "the professor" apparently in jest to a menacing criminal mastermind. Anya, initially reminiscent of <a href="Manuel%20%28Fawlty%20Towers%29">Manuel</a> of "<a href="Fawlty%20Towers">Fawlty Towers</a>" or a character from "<a href="%27Allo%20%27Allo%21">'Allo 'Allo!</a>", faces criticism from her co-conspirators for taking her characterisation too far, allowing the writers, for one critic, to <a href="You%20can%27t%20have%20your%20cake%20and%20eat%20it">have their cake and eat it</a>—any exaggerated characterisation is the fault of the character, not the writers. The script also acknowledge the plot's "silliness" in an almost-<a href="fourth%20wall">fourth-wall</a>-breaking piece of dialogue, when Shearsmith's Archie declares that the characters' plan "was too elaborate".

For one commentator, "The Bill" was the closest episode of "Inside No. 9" to "<a href="The%20League%20of%20Gentlemen">The League of Gentlemen</a>", an earlier project of Shearsmith and Pemberton's, due to its use of <a href="gallows%20humour">gallows humour</a> and back-and-forth dialogue. Critics also compared the episode to the television series "<a href="Hustle%20%28TV%20series%29">Hustle</a>", to the work of the director <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>—including the 1992 film "<a href="Reservoir%20Dogs">Reservoir Dogs</a>"—and to <a href="Roald%20Dahl">Roald Dahl</a>'s 1948 short story "<a href="Man%20from%20the%20South">Man from the South</a>". This latter story was adapted for the television series "<a href="Tales%20of%20the%20Unexpected%20%28TV%20series%29">Tales of the Unexpected</a>", a key influence on "Inside No. 9" as a whole, and by Tarantino for the 1995 anthology film "<a href="Four%20Rooms">Four Rooms</a>". Meanwhile, the premise was compared to that of "<a href="The%20Chinese%20Restaurant">The Chinese Restaurant</a>", a 1991 episode of "<a href="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>".

"The Bill" was generally positively received by critics, being given ratings of five out of five by Mike Ward of the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", four out of five by Hogan ("The Daily Telegraph") and the freelance journalist Dan Owen, and three out of five by Andrew Billen of "The Times". It was praised as "a tight, gloriously stressful half-hour", "hugely enjoyable", "an intricate, wonderfully well-executed tale", and "terrific fun". Mark Butler, writing for <a href="inews.co.uk">inews.co.uk</a>, said that while there had been "Inside No. 9" episodes "with greater atmosphere, invention or ideas", this episode, "as a 30-minute exercise in darkly comic suspense, ... did the trick". It was not, for Butler, among the best episodes; after the conclusion of the fourth series, he identified "The Bill" as the 20th best episode, out of 24. The comedy critic <a href="Bruce%20Dessau">Bruce Dessau</a> described "The Bill" as "quite a low-key opener for the series proper". <a href="Ian%20Hyland">Ian Hyland</a>, writing in the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>", considered "The Bill" a competitor with "<a href="The%2012%20Days%20of%20Christine">The 12 Days of Christine</a>" for the distinction of the best episode of "Inside No. 9" ever. 

The episode was praised as genuinely funny, with a range of different kinds of humour. Praise was also directed at Morales, both Louisa Mellor (<a href="Den%20of%20Geek">Den of Geek</a>) and Owen commenting on his ability to give the impression of movement, even while the episode revolved mostly around four men sitting at a table. Critics commended the performances; Dessau called the cast "uniformly excellent", and Owen said that the script was "brilliantly performed". Ellen E Jones, writing for the "<a href="London%20Evening%20Standard">London Evening Standard</a>", praised both Glenister and Watkins; Hogan did likewise, but argued that Watkins "stealthily stole the show". Owen suggested that, in the episode, "Watkins again proved why he's one of the most underrated comic actors around right now". Mellor identified Watkins and White as offering the strongest performances. Hogan praised White for offering "estimable support", while Billen identified White as the performer who "stole the half-hour".

The story, for Mellor, was strong; "the shocks have the intended impact and the whole half-hour works a treat". She commended the "good writing [and] excellent structure". Hogan considered the episode "ingeniously plotted", and Owen called it "delightfully written". The timing was also praised. Critics were less convinced by the revelation at the end of the episode; though Butler initially called it "satisfying and surprising", he later characterised "the overly-elaborate ending" as lowering the quality of the episode. The ending was criticised as lacking in meaning, and as "prosaically disappointing". For Billen, the reveal made the episode's premise "less interesting", and, for Owen, the characters were too quick to admit defeat. The final scene, in particular, was criticised, some commentators suggesting that, if thought about too much, it was not fully convincing; it was described as "arguably unnecessary" and as offering the episode's only "punch [that failed] to connect".

At the 2018 Writers' Guild Awards, administered by the <a href="Writers%27%20Guild%20of%20Great%20Britain">Writers' Guild of Great Britain</a>, Shearsmith and Pemberton won the Best TV Situation Comedy award for their work on "The Bill". The award was presented by <a href="Brenda%20Gilhooly">Brenda Gilhooly</a>. The other nominees were <a href="Daisy%20May%20Cooper">Daisy May Cooper</a> and Charlie Cooper, the writers of "<a href="This%20Country">This Country</a>", and <a href="Simon%20Blackwell">Simon Blackwell</a>, for his work on "<a href="Back%20%28TV%20series%29">Back</a>".

Vultee Vengeance in Australian service

The <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) operated <a href="Vultee%20Vengeance">Vultee Vengeance</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Australian Government ordered 297 of the type in late 1941 as part of efforts to expand the RAAF. This order was later increased to 400 aircraft. A few Vengeances arrived in Australia during 1942, and large-scale deliveries commenced in early 1943; further orders were cancelled in 1944 after 342 had been delivered.

The RAAF was slow to bring its Vengeances into service, their first combat missions being flown in June 1943. The main deployment of the type took place between mid-January and early March 1944, when <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadrons</a> operated in support of Australian and United States Army forces in New Guinea. This force was withdrawn after only six weeks as the Vengeance was considered inferior to other aircraft available to the Allied air forces. All of the RAAF's five Vengeance-equipped squadrons were re-equipped with <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> heavy bombers. Vengeances continued to be used in training and support roles with the RAAF until 1946, and some were transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> between 1948 and 1950 for ground training.

Historians' assessments of the Vengeance's career in Australian service differ. While there is consensus that the type was obsolete, some argue that it nevertheless proved successful. Others, including the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre, have judged that the Vengeance's performance was mixed and the type was not suited to Australia's requirements.

The Vultee Vengeance was a <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a> designed and built in the United States. It was crewed by a pilot and another airman who served as both a radio operator and <a href="rear%20gunner">rear gunner</a>. <a href="Vultee">Vultee</a> developed the type in the late 1930s for the export market, orders being placed by Brazil, China, France, Turkey and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. In 1940, during the early months of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Britain's <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) took over the French order for 700 aircraft, before the prototype had flown. Flight testing began in July 1941. The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) ordered another 300 Vengeances for the RAF under the terms of the <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> program. Following the United States' entry in the war the USAAF re-possessed at least 243 Vengeances, but never used them operationally as it considered the type inferior to its other attack aircraft and unfit for combat. Several RAF squadrons equipped with the Vengeance saw combat during the <a href="Burma%20Campaign">Burma Campaign</a>. The type proved successful in this theatre, but was soon withdrawn from service.
In mid-1940 the Australian Government placed an order for 243 <a href="Brewster%20Bermuda">Brewster Bermuda</a> dive bombers for the RAAF. This type was still under development, and the program to produce it experienced repeated delays. On 28 September 1941 the British Government offered to provide Vultee Vengeances from its allocation if the RAAF considered them suitable. The Australian <a href="War%20cabinet%23Australia">War Cabinet</a> authorised the purchase of 297 Vultee Vengeances on 22 October 1941 and cancelled the order of Bermudas. By March 1942, the order had been slightly increased to 300 aircraft, of which 57 were to be provided by the United States Government under Lend-Lease and the other 243 paid for by the Australian Government. Australia eventually ordered 400 Vengeances. The price for each of the aircraft purchased by Australia was <a href="Australian%20pound">A£</a>90,000.

Deliveries of the Vengeances to Australia were much delayed. Following Australia's entry into <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> in December 1941, the RAAF order still stood at 297 Vengeances. These aircraft were scheduled to be delivered between January and December 1942. No Vengeances had arrived by 8 May 1942, though the RAAF's order had been increased to 367. A small number of the type arrived in Australia in late May 1942, but subsequent deliveries were slow. This was because the USAAF was also rapidly expanding at this time, which limited the number and types of aircraft available to its allies. Attempts by the Australian Government to obtain Vengeances from USAAF allocations in March 1942, when the country faced a <a href="Proposed%20Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">possible Japanese invasion</a>, were unsuccessful. The majority of the dive bombers arrived after April 1943; by this time the threat of invasion had passed. Overall, Australia received 15 Vengeances in 1942, 227 in 1943 and 100 during 1944. Many of the aircraft required maintenance upon arrival as they had already been used by the American military or suffered from defects. This led to delays in introducing them into service, and caused the type to have a relatively low serviceability rate.

Three different models of the Vengeance were acquired by the RAAF: 99 Mark I aircraft (given <a href="Serial%20code">serial numbers</a> A27-1 to A27-99), 122 Mark IIs (A27-200 to A27-321) and 121 Mark IVs (A27-500/549, A27-560/566 and A27-600/640). The Marks I and II differed only in that they were built by <a href="Northrop%20Corporation">Northrop</a> and Vultee respectively, and were continuations of the British orders. These variants of the Vengeance were armed with six 0.303 calibre <a href="M1919%20Browning%20machine%20gun">M1919 Browning machine gun</a>s (two mounted in each wing, and a pair in the rear cockpit) and powered by a <a href="Wright%20R-2600%20Twin%20Cyclone">Wright R-2600-A5</a> engine. The Mark IV variant was designed to meet USAAF standards. It was armed with six 0.5 calibre <a href="M2%20Browning">M2 Browning</a> machine guns in the same configuration as Marks I and II, and used the more powerful Wright R-2600-13 engine. All of the variants could carry up to of bombs.

Five frontline RAAF units were equipped with Vengeance dive bombers: Nos. <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">12</a>, <a href="No.%2021%20Squadron%20RAAF">21</a>, <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">23</a>, <a href="No.%2024%20Squadron%20RAAF">24</a> and <a href="No.%2025%20Squadron%20RAAF">25 Squadrons</a>. No. 12 Squadron was the first Vengeance unit, replacing its <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s with the type at <a href="Batchelor%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Batchelor, Northern Territory</a>, in September 1942. The same month, No. 21 Squadron was re-formed at <a href="Gawler%2C%20South%20Australia">Gawler, South Australia</a>, equipped with Vengeances. No. 25 Squadron, located at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Pearce">RAAF Station Pearce</a> in Western Australia, received some Vengeances in late 1942, but mainly operated Wirraways until being completely re-equipped with the dive bombers in August 1943. This squadron was the only RAAF unit to be equipped with Mark IV aircraft, which provided far superior performance to the other variants. The next unit to receive Vengeances was No. 24 Squadron, which transitioned to the type at <a href="Bankstown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bankstown, New South Wales</a>, between May and August 1943. The final combat unit to receive Vengeances was No. 23 Squadron, which began its conversion in June 1943 at <a href="Lowood%2C%20Queensland">Lowood, Queensland</a>. While preparing for combat, Vengeance aircraft were at times used to counter <a href="Axis%20naval%20activity%20in%20Australian%20waters">attacks on shipping</a> off the Australian coast; on 18 June 1943, four aircraft from No. 24 Squadron and a pair from No. 23 Squadron were held at readiness to strike the submarine that had attacked <a href="Convoy%20GP55">Convoy GP55</a> off <a href="Smoky%20Cape">Smoky Cape</a> if it was located by patrolling <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s.

Two training units also operated the Vengeance. <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a> received several of the type in 1942. On 1 October 1942, <a href="No.%204%20Operational%20Training%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 4 Operational Training Unit</a> (No. 4 OTU) was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Station Williamtown</a> to train aircrews to operate the Vengeance in combat. The unit began its first <a href="Operational%20conversion%20unit">operational conversion</a> training course on 28 October that year. No. 4 OTU's fleet of Vengeances was augmented with several Wirraways in January 1943; from this time crews began their training on the simple-to-operate Wirraway before progressing onto the Vengeance. Two of the dive bombers were destroyed in flying accidents during August and September 1943, resulting in the deaths of their crews.

Despite the rapid expansion of the Vengeance force, by late 1942 the RAAF was aware that the type was obsolete and other Allied air forces' experiences had demonstrated that dive bombing was an inefficient tactic. Combat experience in Europe showed that dedicated dive bombers were highly vulnerable to attack from <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>, especially when preparing to dive on targets. Few USAAF officers regarded dive bombers as effective, though they were frequently used by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. A USAAF squadron equipped with <a href="Douglas%20A-24%20Banshee">Douglas A-24 Banshee</a> dive bombers was deployed to New Guinea in April 1942, but was withdrawn from combat at the end of May that year after flying only a few combat sorties. The USAAF regarded this type as unsuited to conditions in the theatre, though the US Navy operated it very successfully from its <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s as the Douglas SBD Dauntless. The USAAF preferred to use <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a>s and <a href="light%20bomber">light bomber</a>s to support ground troops in New Guinea. Fighter-bombers were considered particularly useful as they could <a href="Strafing">strafe</a> and <a href="Skip%20bombing">skip bomb</a> Japanese positions as well as employ dive-bombing tactics. Similarly, by late 1942 the RAAF preferred to use the light bombers that it was now beginning to receive to provide tactical support for the Army. An order for 150 <a href="Curtiss%20SB2C%20Helldiver">Curtis Shrike</a> dive bombers was cancelled after the first ten of these aircraft were delivered to Australia in November 1942, making the Vengeance the only dedicated dive bomber operated by the RAAF.

No. 12 Squadron was the first Vengeance-equipped RAAF unit to see combat. After converting to the dive bomber, the squadron was used on routine patrol and search-and-rescue tasks off the coast of the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>. On 18 June 1943, twelve Vengeances from the squadron, escorted by six <a href="No.%2031%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 31 Squadron</a> <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a>s, were dispatched to attack two villages on <a href="Selaru">Selaru</a> island in the occupied <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> that were believed to be housing workers engaged in constructing an airfield. This operation was successful, and all the dive bombers returned to base. In July 1943 the squadron began moving from Darwin to <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a> in <a href="Netherlands%20New%20Guinea">Netherlands New Guinea</a>, where it was to operate as part of <a href="No.%2072%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 72 Wing</a>. A party of 270 ground crew arrived at Merauke early that month, but little of the infrastructure needed to support the unit's aircraft was ready. As a result, No. 12 Squadron's Vengeances and air crew were stationed at <a href="Cooktown%2C%20Queensland">Cooktown, Queensland</a>, from where they conducted anti-submarine patrols and escorted shipping. The aircraft were redeployed to Merauke over the course of September, and began regular patrol duties on the 28th of the month. No. 12 Squadron's only combat during this deployment occurred on 9 October 1943, when a Vengeance exchanged machine-gun fire with a Japanese <a href="Aichi%20E13A">Aichi E13A</a> reconnaissance aircraft. The Vengeances proved unsuited to the maritime patrol tasks they were assigned while at Cooktown and Merauke.

The commander of the Allied Air Forces in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area">South West Pacific</a>, Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, requested in late August 1943 that the RAAF dispatch a squadron of dive bombers to New Guinea for use against pinpoint targets in the <a href="Huon%20Gulf">Huon Gulf</a> area. No. 24 Squadron was selected for this role, and its 18 Vengeances were rushed to <a href="Tsili%20Tsili%20Airfield">Tsili Tsili Airfield</a> before crew training was complete. Little of the squadron's supporting equipment was dispatched as it was intended that the deployment would be temporary. After arriving at Tsili Tsili on 2 September, the squadron flew its first combat mission on the 7th of the month. This operation was frustrated by bad weather, and the aircraft almost ran out of fuel on their return flight due to difficulties in locating their airfield. An attack the next day was successful. On 18 September, No. 24 Squadron dispatched 14 aircraft as part of an attack on Japanese positions near <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a> in preparation for a landing by Australian Army forces. The squadron destroyed a Japanese radio station on the <a href="Tami%20Islands">Tami Islands</a> near Finschhafen area on 21 September. It provided support for Australian Army units involved in the <a href="Huon%20Peninsula%20campaign">Huon Peninsula campaign</a> during late September and October. This included playing a significant role in halting a major Japanese counter-attack during early to mid October.

The lack of ground equipment complicated No. 24 Squadron's operations, especially as it took a long time for this material to arrive once a decision to retain the unit in New Guinea had been made. As a result of equipment shortages and inadequate aircrew training, the squadron was not fully ready for combat until December; this greatly frustrated Kenney's deputy, Brigadier General <a href="Ennis%20Whitehead">Ennis Whitehead</a>, who commented that "we have never gotten a mission out of that unit". Some of the training deficiencies were due to the RAAF's practice of stationing operational training units in southern Australia, with the result that aircrew were unfamiliar with flying in tropical conditions. During December, the squadron operated against Japanese positions on <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> and <a href="New%20Ireland%20%28island%29">New Ireland</a> ahead of the American landings in western New Britain.

In September 1943, Kenney asked the RAAF to provide a mobile strike force for offensive operations in New Guinea. The RAAF decided that the force should comprise a <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a> equipped with Vengeance aircraft and another wing of fighters to escort the dive bombers. <a href="No.%2077%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 77 Wing</a> was formed as the dive bomber unit in what was designated <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">No. 10 (Operational) Group</a>, and comprised Nos. 21, 23 and 24 Squadrons as well as service and medical units. The other major element of the group was <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 Wing</a>, which included three fighter squadrons. It was originally intended for No. 10 Group to begin moving to New Guinea on 1 December 1943, but problems with planning the deployment and transport shortfalls meant that most of its elements did not depart Australia until mid-January 1944. No. 24 Squadron arrived at No. 77 Wing's intended base at <a href="Nadzab">Nadzab</a> in New Guinea on 16 January 1944. No. 23 Squadron arrived at Nadzab on 9 February and No. 21 Squadron on the 18th of that month.
No. 77 Wing's initial combat missions were conducted by No. 24 Squadron. From 17 to 23 January the unit supported Australian Army units involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shaggy%20Ridge">Battle of Shaggy Ridge</a> by conducting highly accurate dive-bombing strikes on Japanese positions. These attacks compensated for the Army units' lack of artillery, and assisted them to capture well-protected Japanese positions. The Vengeances were typically escorted by <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk</a> fighters from No. 78 Wing. No. 24 Squadron also attacked buildings on Gragat Island near <a href="Madang">Madang</a> on 24 January as part of a raid involving two squadrons of <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">North American B-25 Mitchell</a> medium bombers. On 29 February the squadron bombed Japanese positions near the village of <a href="Orgoruna">Orgoruna</a> and strafed the settlement in support of Army units; during this operation two Vengeances experienced engine problems, one being destroyed in a crash landing. Two days later, No. 24 Squadron attacked and destroyed a bridge defended by <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a> at the village of <a href="Bogadjim">Bogadjim</a>. Only three of the five aircraft dispatched were able to locate the target, and two were damaged by fragments from the bombs they dropped. Historian Mark Johnston has judged this operation to have been "perhaps the Vultees' most notable achievement" in Australian service. No. 24 Squadron was withdrawn from combat for two weeks on 31 January to undertake what official historian <a href="George%20Odgers">George Odgers</a> described as "much-needed training exercises" for recently arrived replacement aircrew.
The wing's operations expanded during February 1944. No. 23 Squadron entered combat on 11 February when six of its aircraft, operating in conjunction with six from No. 24 Squadron, bombed three villages south of <a href="Saidor">Saidor</a> in support of <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> forces. The next day twelve aircraft from No. 23 Squadron and six from No. 24 Squadron made unsuccessful attacks against a road near Bogadjim after bad weather forced the cancellation of a close air support mission. For the remainder of the month, No. 78 Wing's main tasks were to attack the Japanese Army's <a href="20th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">20th Division</a> as it retreated from Allied forces and to strike Japanese airfields at <a href="Alexishafen">Alexishafen</a> and Madang. On 22 February, aircraft from all three of the wing's squadrons attacked camouflaged Japanese barge harbours near Madang; this was No. 21 Squadron's first combat operation. The next day ten Vengeances bombed Saidor. On 24 February, 23 Vengeances from Nos. 21 and 23 Squadrons struck Japanese anti-aircraft gun positions at <a href="Hansa%20Bay">Hansa Bay</a>. Two aircraft from No. 23 Squadron were shot down with the loss of their crews. On 26, 27 and 28 February all three of the wing's squadrons attacked the airfields at Madang and Alexishafen to prevent Japanese forces from using them to attack the Allied forces which had <a href="Admiralty%20Islands%20campaign">landed on the Admiralty Islands</a>. The first and second of these operations involved twelve aircraft from each squadron. A total of 33 Vengeances were dispatched for the operation on 28 February, when they and No. 78 Wing combined to form an attack force of 62 aircraft. Despite the size of these operations, No. 77 Wing's aircrew judged that the airfields were not being used by the Japanese as damage from earlier attacks went unrepaired.

No. 77 Wing conducted further combat operations during early March. On the second of the month, 24 Vengeances attacked Japanese positions on <a href="Karkar%20Island">Karkar Island</a>, encountering only light anti-aircraft gunfire. Over the next two days the wing targeted Japanese positions on the <a href="Rai%20Coast%20District">Rai coast</a> in preparation for a US Army landing scheduled for 5 March. On 3 March, Nos. 23 and 24 Squadrons attacked <a href="Mindiri">Mindiri</a> village and a nearby camp site. Aircraft from all three of the wing's squadrons attacked a camp at <a href="Pommern%20Bay">Pommern Bay</a> on two occasions the next day. One Vengeance was damaged in a forced landing. The US Army unit's landing at Mindiri on 5 March did not encounter any opposition. On 8 March a force of 36 Vengeances from all three of No. 77 Wing's squadrons was dispatched to strike Rempi village near Alexishafen. Due to bad weather, No. 23 Squadron aborted its attack, and bombed a target to the north of the village. The other two squadrons successfully approached Rempi by making shallow dives through the clouds, and bombed the target area. Four Vengeances were lightly damaged by anti-aircraft fire.

The attack on Rempi was the final combat operation involving Australian Vengeances. On 8 March 1944, General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s General Headquarters, which commanded all Allied forces in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, directed No. 77 Wing's squadrons to return to Australia and No. 78 Wing to move to the <a href="Cape%20Gloucester">Cape Gloucester</a> area of New Britain. This decision, which had been endorsed by <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, took No. 10 Group's headquarters and personnel by surprise and led to the cancellation of a raid on Rempi planned for that day. To keep No. 10 Group up to strength, three light bomber squadrons were transferred from <a href="No.%209%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Group</a> to No. 77 Wing. During a subsequent discussion between Kenney and Air Vice-Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Force</a>, the American general stated that he did not intend to use the Vengeance in combat again. Jones immediately directed the RAAF's representative in Washington DC to cancel the order for 58 Vengeances that had not yet been delivered to Australia.

Several factors explain the withdrawal of the RAAF's Vengeances from combat. Odgers judged that a key reason behind the decision was the poor performance of the Vengeance compared to other available aircraft in the region. USAAF units equipped with superior types were arriving in New Guinea during early 1944, and Kenney wanted to free up scarce space at forward airfields so that he could launch attacks on the important Japanese bases at <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a> and <a href="Jayapura">Hollandia</a>; these targets were beyond the range of the Vengeance. In particular, No. 77 Wing was required to vacate Nadzab so that its airfields could accommodate a <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">group</a> of long-ranged <a href="Lockheed%20P-38%20Lightning">Lockheed P-38 Lightning</a> fighters. Odgers also argued that the Vengeances had proven to be mechanically unreliable, and had difficulty taking off while carrying a full bomb load: in practice it was found that they could carry only the same bomb load as Kittyhawk fighters. The Kittyhawks were also superior at strafing targets and did not need to be escorted. A 2008 paper written by staff of the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre disputed Odgers' views on the reliability of the aircraft, stating that No. 77 Wing had a good serviceability rate. This paper instead argued that difficulties in supplying the wing may have been a more important factor.

No. 77 Wing's three dive bomber squadrons returned to Australia during March 1944 to be re-equipped with <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> heavy bombers. The RAAF had previously intended to establish new squadrons to introduce the Liberator into service, and the availability of the Vengeance-equipped units simplified this process. All of the squadrons' dive bombers departed Nadzab on 13 March, and their ground crews followed soon afterwards. No. 21 Squadron was transferred to <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Camden, New South Wales</a>, No. 23 Squadron to <a href="Northern%20Peninsula%20Airport">Higgins Field</a> in Cape York where it operated as an army-cooperation unit as part of <a href="No.%2075%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 75 Wing</a>, and No. 24 Squadron to Lowood. All three units ceased flying Vengeances shortly afterwards. No. 4 OTU was also disbanded on 30 April 1944. No. 12 Squadron remained at Merauke until July 1944, when it was withdrawn to <a href="Strathpine%2C%20Queensland">Strathpine, Queensland</a>, and handed in its Vengeances ahead of also receiving Liberators.
No. 25 Squadron was the final RAAF combat unit to operate Vengeances, which it used to conduct anti-submarine patrols and army-cooperation tasks from Pearce. During the <a href="Western%20Australian%20emergency%20of%20March%201944">Western Australian emergency of March 1944</a>, the squadron was held at readiness to launch dive-bombing attacks on the Japanese ships that were feared to be approaching the <a href="Perth">Perth</a> region. This provided to be a false alarm, and the unit soon resumed its normal duties. In January 1945, No. 25 Squadron began converting to the Liberator.

The RAAF used Vengeance aircraft for a variety of tasks following their withdrawal from combat roles. The type was operated by Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force%20Communication%20Units">Communication Units</a>, which were responsible for light transport and training tasks. <a href="Aircraft%20Research%20and%20Development%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 1 Air Performance Unit</a> employed Vengeances as <a href="target%20tug">target tug</a>s and for trials purposes. <a href="No.%207%20Operational%20Training%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 7 Operational Training Unit</a>, which was responsible for converting aircrew to Liberator bombers, was issued with Vengeance target tugs. Vengeances were also used in trials of <a href="Chemical%20warfare">poison gas</a> conducted by the 1st Australian Field Experimental Station, Royal Australian Engineers, near <a href="Proserpine%2C%20Queensland">Proserpine, Queensland</a>, during 1944. In May 1944, Vengeances from No. 21 Squadron were used to impersonate German <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> dive bombers during the production of the movie <a href="The%20Rats%20of%20Tobruk%20%281944%20film%29">"The Rats of Tobruk"</a>. For this task the aircraft were painted with <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> markings.

The type was withdrawn from service in 1946; as of June that year the RAAF had 235 Vengeances on hand, but only required two. The aircraft were disposed of over the next six years, most being sold for scrap. Twelve Vengeance airframes were transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> between 1948 and 1951 to be used for ground handling and fire-fighting training. Only a single complete RAAF Vengeance, the former A27-99, was preserved. As of 1986 this aircraft was on display at the <a href="Camden%20Museum%20of%20Aviation">Camden Museum of Aviation</a> in the outskirts of Sydney. At this time, most parts of the airframe of the former A27-247 were also held by the <a href="Aviation%20Heritage%20Museum%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Aviation Heritage Museum</a> in Perth.

The RAAF's acquisition and use of the Vultee Vengeance remains controversial. The Air Power Development Centre judged that the type's service was not "conspicuously good or bad", and Stewart Wilson described it as having a "somewhat indifferent career". Historian Peter C. Smith has argued that the decision to withdraw the Vengeances from combat was mistaken, as the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> successfully used dive bombers for close air support tasks in the South West Pacific until the end of the war and the RAAF could have built on No. 77 Wing's "great but limited achievement". Similarly, Michael Nelmes has written that No. 77 Wing's dive-bombing operations were successful. In contrast, American historian Eric Bergerud has written that by selling Australia Vengeances, the US Government "unloaded junk". In his memoirs, <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Jones</a> described the type as "a hopeless failure". Australian historian Chris Clark has noted that one of the reasons the RAAF was excluded from major campaigns during the last years of the Pacific War was that many of its units were equipped with inferior aircraft such as the Vengeance.

The Australian Government and RAAF were embarrassed by the rapid withdrawal from service of aircraft that had been acquired at considerable cost. However, their crews generally acknowledged the Vengeance's shortcomings and accepted the decision. Evatt also came to regret the deal he struck which led to the acquisition of the Vengeance, and jokingly told Jones at a War Cabinet meeting to not "mention the bloody Vultees or I'll break your wrist". The Air Power Development Centre's analysis of the Vengeance's RAAF career concluded that the type had been unsuited to the service's requirements, and "demonstrates the need to align force structure, doctrine and equipment".

Equestrian statue of Edward Horner

The equestrian statue of Edward Horner stands inside <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20Church%2C%20Mells">St Andrew's Church</a> in the village of <a href="Mells%2C%20Somerset">Mells</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, south-western England. It was designed by the architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, as a memorial to Edward Horner, who died of wounds in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. The sculpture was executed by <a href="Alfred%20Munnings">Alfred Munnings</a>.

Edward Horner was the only surviving son and heir of <a href="John%20Francis%20Fortescue%20Horner">Sir John</a> and <a href="Frances%20Horner">Lady Frances Horner</a> of <a href="Mells%20Manor">Mells Manor</a> and a member of an extended upper-class social group known as <a href="the%20Coterie">the Coterie</a>, many of whom were killed in the war; the group included his fiancée and his future brother-in-law. Shortly after the war broke out, he was a <a href="yeomanry">yeomanry</a> officer in the part-time <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> but he was keen to join the fighting on the Western Front and obtained a transfer to a cavalry regiment through his family's connections. He was wounded in May 1915 and did not return to the war until early 1917. He was assigned a staff post but again secured a transfer to the front line. Shortly after his return to the fighting, on 21 November 1917, he was wounded again; he died the same day.

Lutyens was a friend of the Horner family, having designed multiple buildings and structures for them since the beginning of the 20th century. As well as Horner's memorial, he designed a memorial to <a href="Raymond%20Asquith">Raymond Asquith</a> (also in St Andrew's Church), and <a href="Mells%20War%20Memorial">Mells War Memorial</a> in the centre of the village. For Horner's memorial, Lutyens designed the plinth himself, and engaged the renowned equestrian painter and war artist Alfred Munnings for the latter's first public work of sculpture. The plinth is in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> and set into it is Horner's original grave marker; the family's coat of arms is carved into the front, while the sides bear various dedicatory inscriptions. The statue is a bronze of a cavalry officer on horseback, bare-headed, with his helmet and sword on the horse's saddle. Lutyens was known for abstract and ecumenical themes in his war memorial designs, but the statue of Horner is an example of his use of more conventional imagery to commemorate an individual. Installed in the Horner family chapel in St Andrew's Church in 1920 at a cost of £1,000, it was moved to its present location in the church in 2007.

Edward William Horner (born 3 May 1888) was the son of <a href="John%20Francis%20Fortescue%20Horner">Sir John Horner</a>, KCVO, of <a href="Mells%20Manor">Mells Manor</a>, and his wife <a href="Frances%20Horner">Frances</a> (née Graham). The family was reputed to be descendants of "<a href="Little%20Jack%20Horner">Little Jack Horner</a>", the subject of an 18th-century nursery rhyme. Sir John was a London <a href="barrister">barrister</a> and later <a href="Commissioners%20of%20Woods%2C%20Forests%20and%20Land%20Revenues">commissioner of woods</a>, for which he was knighted in 1908. Frances was a prominent member of <a href="the%20Souls">the Souls</a> social group, whom she regularly hosted at Mells. 

Edward was the eldest of their four children. He was the last direct male heir of the Horner family, his only brother (Mark) having died of <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a> before the war. Edward was educated at <a href="Summer%20Fields%20School">Summer Fields School</a> near <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, then at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> and <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>, where he was a member of the <a href="Officers%27%20Training%20Corps">Officers' Training Corps</a>. At Oxford, he became part of the social network known as <a href="the%20Coterie">the Coterie</a>. The group was made up largely of heirs to aristocratic families and included <a href="Raymond%20Asquith">Raymond Asquith</a>, Horner's future brother-in-law. Many of them were frequent visitors to Mells Manor at the beginning of the 20th century and Horner was unofficially engaged to another member, <a href="Lady%20Diana%20Manners">Lady Diana Manners</a>. Horner struggled academically, graduating from Oxford with only a <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification%23Third-class%20honours">third-class degree</a>, much to the disappointment of his parents and particularly his mother, who concentrated all her ambitions on Edward after Mark's premature death. Struggling for career options, Edward pursued his parents' ambition for him to become a barrister. He was <a href="called%20to%20the%20bar">called to the bar</a>, and began a <a href="pupillage">pupillage</a> in 1914 in the chambers of Hugh Fraser under the ultimate guidance of <a href="F.%20E.%20Smith%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Birkenhead">F. E. Smith</a>, one of the most distinguished barristers of the day.

Like many contemporary men, especially those from aristocratic backgrounds, Horner felt a keen sense of patriotism fostered by his private education and by tales from imperial campaigns around the turn of the 20th century, especially the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> (1899–1902). On 19 August 1914, he was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="North%20Somerset%20Yeomanry">North Somerset Yeomanry</a>, a part-time <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> unit with no obligation to serve abroad. After the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in August 1914, his regiment was ordered to Hampshire for training. Unlike the men under his command, among them farmers who were reluctant to leave their land, Horner was keen to join the fighting in France. As an influential aristocratic family, the Horners were able to secure him a transfer first to the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Guards">Royal Horse Guards</a> and then, in October 1914, to the <a href="18th%20%28Queen%20Mary%27s%20Own%29%20Hussars">18th (Queen Mary's Own) Hussars</a>. The 18th Hussars were stationed at <a href="Tidworth%20Camp">Tidworth Camp</a> in Wiltshire under the <a href="11th%20Reserve%20Cavalry">11th Reserve Cavalry</a> for training, after which they were deployed to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in early 1915.

Horner arrived first at <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>, well behind the front, and then in February 1915 was ordered forward to <a href="Hazebrouck">Hazebrouck</a> on the Belgian border. In May 1915, he was assigned to escort a working party to dig trenches on the north side of the <a href="Yser%20Canal">Yser Canal</a>. During the march, he was wounded in the stomach by shrapnel from an artillery shell. Hospitalised at the No. 7 General Hospital at <a href="Boulogne">Boulogne</a> in France, he had a kidney removed, and at one point his condition was so grave that his parents were given special permission to visit him. They were accompanied by his fiancée (Lady Manners) and a private doctor and nurse. He left the hospital on 1 June and was allowed to return to Mells to recuperate for the summer of 1915. Eager to return to the front, Horner went before a medical board in December 1915 but was told that his missing kidney rendered him ineligible for front-line duties. He was sent again to Tidworth to await orders, which arrived in January 1916, instructing him to sail for Egypt. He was promoted to temporary <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a> in November 1916.

He was first assigned a staff post in Egypt but was again able to transfer to a fighting role in France in February 1917. In October that year, the family's second home at <a href="Mells%20Park">Mells Park</a> was destroyed by fire; Horner was given compassionate leave in early November and returned to the village to visit his parents. Returning to France, he was given command of a <a href="troop">troop</a> (16 soldiers and horses). The 18th Hussars were part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a>, where they were holding the village of <a href="Noyelles-sur-Escaut">Noyelles</a>, south-east of Cambrai itself. He was hit by sniper fire on 21 November 1917 and evacuated to No. 48 <a href="Casualty%20Clearing%20Station">Casualty Clearing Station</a> near <a href="Ytres">Ytres</a> but died that evening. He is buried in <a href="Rocquigny-Equancourt%20Road%20British%20Cemetery">Rocquigny-Equancourt Road British Cemetery</a>, maintained by the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a>. The headstone for his grave in France contains the epitaph "Small time, but in that small most greatly lived this star of England", from Shakespeare's "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>".

<a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> was among the most distinguished architects for war memorials in Britain. He became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> and his design for <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on London's <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>. As well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across Britain, Lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients. Many were heirs to the country houses Lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in Mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century. His work in Mells arose through his friend and collaborator <a href="Gertrude%20Jekyll">Gertrude Jekyll</a>, who introduced him to the Horners through a family connection. Lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village. In addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to Raymond Asquith (Edward's brother-in-law), also located in St Andrew's Church, and the <a href="Mells%20War%20Memorial">village war memorial</a>. Lutyens designed two other memorials to Horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in St Andrew's Church; and a stone tablet in <a href="Cambrai%20Cathedral">Cambrai Cathedral</a>.

<a href="Alfred%20Munnings">Alfred Munnings</a> was a painter specialising in horses. He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye. He volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian <a href="war%20artist">war artist</a> attached to Canadian cavalry. In 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the <a href="Jockey%20Club">Jockey Club</a> for a sculpture of the racehorse <a href="Brown%20Jack">Brown Jack</a> at <a href="Epsom%20Downs%20Racecourse">Epsom Downs Racecourse</a>. Munnings produced two models in clay for review by Lady Horner; he worked from photographs provided by Lady Horner and a live model in producing the statue. At one point, Munnings was so dissatisfied with the statue's head that he cut it off and re-cast it from scratch.

The memorial stands inside St Andrew's Church in Mells. The Horner family had a long association with the church, which shares a wall with the manor house. The family has its own chapel (formerly the Lady Chapel) in the church which contains the tombs of several family members. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Horners funded extensive restoration work to the building. The memorial is a bronze <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian statue</a>, sculpted by Munnings, featuring Edward Horner as a young cavalry officer, bare-headed and seated on horseback with his sword and helmet attached to the saddle. The statue originally faced a stained-glass window featuring a <a href="Madonna%20and%20Child">Madonna and Child</a>, creating the image of Horner riding towards the light. It stands on a <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> plinth designed by Lutyens, reminiscent of his Cenotaph and described by Lutyens' biographer <a href="Jane%20Ridley">Jane Ridley</a> as "deceptively simple". The temporary memorial cross, which originally marked Horner's grave in France, inscribed , is set into the rear of the plinth while the Horner family's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> is moulded into the front. The south (left) side bears the inscription , while the north (right) side reads , from <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>'s "<a href="Adona%C3%AFs">Adonaïs</a>" (1821), an elegy for <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>.
According to Colin Amery, who chaired an exhibition of Lutyens' work in the 1980s, "some of [Lutyens'] finest memorials and tombs" are to be found in Mells, and Edward Horner's memorial is one of "Lutyens' best and most moving tributes to the waste of life in the Great War". In his public war memorials (particularly the Cenotaph and the various memorials based on it), Lutyens often used abstract and ecumenical designs, feeling that a different form of architecture was needed to convey the sense of sorrow at the enormous loss of life. Where he was commissioned to commemorate an individual, however, Lutyens was more open to conventional imagery, such as a statue of an officer. According to Tim Skelton, author of "Lutyens and the Great War" (2008), the Horner statue is "widely considered to be one of the most moving of personal memorials to the [First World War]". Lutyens' original design for Horner's memorial included pillars rising from the plinth to enclose the statue in a <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a>, but this part of the proposal was not implemented. Munnings' mould for the statue is on display at the <a href="Castle%20House%2C%20Dedham%23Sir%20Alfred%20Munnings%20Art%20Museum">Munnings Art Museum</a>, in his former home and studio in <a href="Dedham%2C%20Essex">Dedham</a> in Essex.

The statue was installed in 1920. It cost over £1,000 and was by far the largest and most elaborate of the several war-related monuments in Mells. Frances Horner initially hoped for it to stand underneath the church's bell tower, but the suggestion prompted objections from villagers and the <a href="churchwarden">churchwarden</a>s, who were hesitant about having it in the church at all. Thus it was placed in the Horner chapel, on the north side of the chancel. In 2007 it was moved to the west end of the north aisle, as the church trustees wished to create space to allow more flexible use of the church.

Cyclone Ada

Severe Tropical Cyclone Ada was a small but intense <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that severely impacted the <a href="Whitsunday%20Region">Whitsunday Region</a> of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, in January 1970. It has been described as a defining event in the history of the <a href="Whitsunday%20Islands">Whitsunday Islands</a>, and was the most damaging storm in the mainland town of <a href="Proserpine%2C%20Queensland">Proserpine</a>'s history at the time. Forming over the far eastern <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a> in early January, the weather disturbance that would become Ada remained weak and disorganised for nearly two weeks as it slowly moved in a clockwise loop. Accelerating toward the southwest, the system was named Ada on 15 January. All observations of the fledgling cyclone were made remotely with <a href="weather%20satellite">weather satellite</a> imagery until it passed over an <a href="automated%20weather%20station">automated weather station</a> on 16 January. The extremely compact cyclone, with a <a href="Beaufort%20scale">gale</a> radius of just , intensified into a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">Category 3 severe tropical cyclone</a> just before striking the Whitsunday Islands at 14:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> on 17 January. At 18:30 UTC, Ada's <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> crossed the coast at <a href="Shute%20Harbour">Shute Harbour</a>. The cyclone made little inland progress before stalling northwest of <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay</a> and dissipating on 19 January.

Ada devastated multiple resort islands in the Whitsundays, in some cases destroying virtually all facilities and guest cabins. The biggest resort, located on <a href="Daydream%20Island">Daydream Island</a>, was obliterated, with similar destruction seen on <a href="South%20Molle%20Island">South Molle</a>, <a href="Hayman%20Island">Hayman</a>, and <a href="Long%20Island%20%28Whitsunday%20Islands%29">Long</a> islands; since most boats docked on these islands were destroyed, hundreds of tourists in these resorts became stranded and required emergency rescue. Based on the severity of the damage, wind gusts were later estimated at 220 km/h (140 mph). As Ada moved ashore, most homes were damaged or destroyed in communities near the storm's <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> point, including <a href="Cannonvale">Cannonvale</a>, <a href="Airlie%20Beach">Airlie Beach</a>, and Shute Harbour. Extreme rainfall totals as high as caused massive river flooding in coastal waterways between <a href="Bowen%2C%20Queensland">Bowen</a> and Mackay. The floodwaters washed out roads and left some locations isolated for days. Offshore, seven people were missing and presumed dead after their <a href="fishing%20trawler">fishing trawler</a> encountered the cyclone. Ada killed a total of 14 people, including 11 at sea, and caused <a href="A%24">A$</a>12 million in damage. The cyclone revealed inadequacies in the warning broadcast system, and served as the impetus for enhanced cyclone awareness programs that have been credited with saving lives in subsequent cyclones.

Cyclone Ada was first noted by <a href="weather%20satellite">weather satellite</a> imagery as a disorganised area of disturbed weather over the eastern <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a> on 5 January. In the early stages of its life, the system was far from ships and only peripherally detected by weather stations. More recent analyses have determined the tropical low originated on 3 January, just west of <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a>. For about ten days between 5 and 15 January, observations of the low remained scarce, but infrequent satellite imagery revealed that it slowly completed a cyclonic loop nearing the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> before curving back toward the southwest while remaining weak. On 15 January, the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Meteorology">Bureau of Meteorology</a>'s (BoM) <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Warning%20Centre">Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre</a> in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> named the storm "Ada" and issued the first warning to shipping interests. Ada reached <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">tropical cyclone status</a> on the modern-day Australian cyclone scale the next day, while centered near . The cyclone continued tracking west-southwest toward Queensland, and at 14:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> on 16 January, it passed over an automated weather station on Marion Reef, about east of <a href="Bowen%2C%20Queensland">Bowen</a>. The site recorded sustained winds of up to .

With the first direct confirmation of the storm's growing strength, the BoM issued its initial public cyclone warning at 19:00 UTC. The cyclone's centre moved within range of the <a href="weather%20radar">weather radar</a> site in <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay</a> around 06:00 UTC on 17 January. Over the next several hours, radar revealed the system was moving slower and more erratically than expected, occasionally jogging to the east. Ada was an exceptionally compact cyclone, with a radius of <a href="Beaufort%20scale">gale-force</a> winds, compared to the 150 km (100 mi) radius generally considered "small" for tropical cyclones. Between 11:00 and 17:00 UTC on 17 January, the cyclone's <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> shrank from to just across, as measured by radar. As a result of its small size, the storm's onslaught was much more sudden than normal, with little rain and steady <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a>s in the hours before <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a>. At 12:00 UTC on 17 January, Ada reached its peak intensity, with 10-minute average <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">maximum sustained winds</a> of 150 km/h (90 mph). This made it a Category 3 <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Australia%20and%20Fiji">severe tropical cyclone</a>.

Beginning around 14:00 UTC, the core of Ada crossed the <a href="Whitsunday%20Islands">Whitsunday Islands</a>. As the eye passed overhead, pressure fell to on <a href="Hayman%20Island">Hayman Island</a>—just under northeast of <a href="Shute%20Harbour">Shute Harbour</a> on the mainland—and although peak winds were not measured, gusts on Hayman Island were estimated at over ; similar estimates were made by a ship in the Whitsunday Passage. <a href="Dent%20Island%20%28Queensland%29">Dent Island</a> recorded a pressure of as the centre made its closest approach at 17:30 UTC. At 18:30 UTC, the system made landfall at Shute Harbour on the Whitsunday Coast while still at peak intensity. Air pressure at <a href="Airlie%20Beach">Airlie Beach</a>, about away from the centre of circulation, fell to , suggesting that the storm's minimum central pressure was slightly lower. Upon moving ashore, the system slowed and curved toward the south, and after reaching a point about northwest of Mackay on 18 January, it became nearly stationary. Around the same time, the cyclone's structure began to deteriorate, with multiple circulation centres appearing on radar imagery. Just after 06:00 UTC on 19 January, the BoM issued its final advisory on Ada, and the system dissipated shortly after.

As Ada reached <a href="North%20Queensland">North Queensland</a>, the BoM issued cyclone warnings on a three-hour cycle, with more frequent bulletins occasionally released as needed. <a href="Flood%20warning">Flood warning</a>s were issued for watersheds of susceptible rivers like the <a href="Pioneer%20River">Pioneer</a> and <a href="Connors%20River">Connors</a>. The bureau's post-storm assessment of the disaster revealed that local broadcasts of advisories were sometimes delayed by several hours or not made at all, and public awareness was generally inadequate. In a misguided attempt to quell panic, one radio station appended the BoM's warning with an unapproved message that there was no cause for alarm because of the cyclone's small size. Due to the unusual nature of the storm, including its delayed arrival in some areas, many residents criticised or disregarded forecasts. Additionally, many tourists in the region were unfamiliar with the dangers of tropical cyclones. Findings from studies of the public response to Ada were used as the basis for upgraded warning systems and the introduction of more cyclone education campaigns; these initiatives were credited with saving lives and property in later storms such as <a href="Cyclone%20Althea">Cyclone Althea</a> in December 1971.

Offshore, the <a href="concrete%20ship">concrete</a> <a href="fishing%20trawler">fishing trawler</a> "Whakatane" went missing while en route from Mackay to <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville</a>. The search for the vessel and her seven occupants was suspended on 26 January, around the same time that wreckage, believed to be from "Whakatane", was identified near <a href="Long%20Island%20%28Whitsunday%20Islands%29">Long Island</a>. According to the BoM, maritime tragedies during Ada were likely caused by delayed or insufficient response to warnings. Some boatowners remained aboard their vessels throughout the cyclone and others attempted to move their boats to different locations during the lull at the storm's eye. In one instance, five men were reported missing after they ventured into the storm to secure a boat anchored at Hayman Island. Overall, storm damage was estimated at <a href="A%24">A$</a>12 million, the equivalent of over $1 billion in 2012 values when accounting for growth and inflation. Ada is believed to have killed 14 people, 11 of them at sea.

In the Whitsundays, Ada's impact was most severe on Hayman, Long, <a href="Daydream%20Island">Daydream</a>, <a href="South%20Molle%20Island">South Molle</a>, and <a href="Hook%20Island">Hook</a> islands. Peak winds in the storm's path were not recorded, but based on the severity of the damage, it is estimated that gusts may have exceeded . Many trees were either blown over or debarked and stripped of their foliage, with scraps of roofing material left hanging from their limbs. Throughout the islands, Ada ravaged resorts and boats, forcing hundreds of holidaymakers to await emergency rescue.

Most of the accommodation cabins were destroyed on South Molle Island, where a woman in one of the structures was killed and her partner severely injured. Damage on South Molle amounted to $500,000. On Hayman Island, the winds unroofed most cabins and other buildings, accounting for an estimated $1 million in damage. Long Island was subjected to Ada's left-front quadrant—the most intense part of the storm—and the Palm Bay Resort there was devastated, with only a few huts remaining. However, another resort on the western side of the island escaped relatively unscathed. The biggest resort in the Whitsundays at the time, on Daydream Island, was destroyed, requiring $400,000 to rebuild. About 150 tourists sought shelter in part of a recreation hall, which was the only major portion of a building left intact on Daydream. Nearly every building on Hook Island was lost, and four men remained sheltered there for a week after the storm. Farther south, rough seas broke apart a stone <a href="jetty">jetty</a> at <a href="Brampton%20Island">Brampton Island</a> in the <a href="Cumberland%20Islands%20%28Queensland%29">Cumberland Group</a>.

Torrential rains extended along mostly rural areas of the coast from <a href="Bowen%2C%20Queensland">Bowen</a> to Mackay, while the strongest winds were concentrated in the area from <a href="Cannonvale%2C%20Queensland">Cannonvale</a> to Shute Harbor and extending inland to <a href="Proserpine%2C%20Queensland">Proserpine</a>. Nine hours of damaging winds unroofed or otherwise damaged around 40% of the houses in Proserpine in what was described as the worst storm in the town's history at the time. Trees were uprooted, crops were flattened, and residential <a href="outhouse">outhouse</a>s were blown apart. Elsewhere, in Shute Harbour, a motel and the few houses there were demolished, along with 85% of the homes in Airlie Beach and nearly all of Cannonvale's 200 houses. According to Minister for Mines and Main Roads <a href="Ron%20Camm">Ron Camm</a>, the cyclone forced 750 people from their homes. Around 200 storm victims sought refuge in a school in Cannonvale that was converted into an emergency shelter.

As the winds subsided, the weakening cyclone dropped as much as of rain, resulting in massive river flooding near the coast. Some locations received up to of precipitation in just 24 hours. The Pioneer River in Mackay and the <a href="Don%20River%20%28North%20Queensland%29">Don River</a> in Bowen both experienced severe flooding; the latter overtopped a bridge by , while at one point the former was well above <a href="flood%20stage">flood stage</a> and rising by per hour. A shopping centre in Mackay was flooded to a depth of 1 meter. Some waterways approached all-time record levels, with one creek north of Proserpine swelling to across. Many farms were inundated by floodwaters, losing livestock, machinery, and crops. The torrents washed out bridges and roads and severed communications, isolating communities such as Proserpine and Airlie Beach for several days. As a result of the widespread flooding, hundreds of motorists became stranded on a long stretch of the <a href="Bruce%20Highway">Bruce Highway</a>. Two people died in the flood-ravaged area, including one soldier who drowned near Proserpine. From Bowen north to Townsville, more modest rainfall associated with the <a href="upper-level%20low">upper-level</a> remnants of Ada proved beneficial, helping to alleviate persistent <a href="drought">drought</a> conditions.

Following the storm, looters traveled to Proserpine to pick through ruined homes and boats. The nine-officer police force were unable to manage the outbreak of crime, and an anti-looting squad soon arrived in the town. <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> soldiers and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a> planes dispatched to the Whitsunday Islands evacuated around 500 people from the devastated resort islands. Meanwhile, <a href="Australian%20Royal%20Navy">Navy</a> boats retrieved injured individuals requiring urgent medical treatment. Private citizens also rushed to the aid of stranded resort guests; in January 2014, a local boat captain was formally honoured by MP <a href="George%20Christensen%20%28politician%29">George Christensen</a> and <a href="Premier%20of%20Queensland">Premier</a> <a href="Campbell%20Newman">Campbell Newman</a> for his role in evacuating 180 people from Daydream Island.

With <a href="Government%20of%20Queensland">Queensland</a>'s resources already strained by an ongoing severe drought, the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Commonwealth Government of Australia</a> agreed to evenly split the cost of restoring government assets damaged by Ada; this expenditure would normally fall to the state alone. By August 1970, the state and federal governments had issued a combined $708,000 in grants for repairing flood damage in Bowen. The name "Ada" was later <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Australian%20cyclone%20names%23Tropical%20Cyclone%20names%20retired%20in%20the%201970s">retired</a> from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list due to the cyclone's severe impact.

In the islands, about 400 workers rushed to repair the resorts before peak tourism season; by mid-May, about 100 holiday cabins had been rebuilt and 20 boats restored to service. Hayman and Daydream islands reopened to guests in June and August 1970, respectively. South Molle Island changed ownership multiple times during the 1970s as it struggled to reattain its pre-Ada success, and many of the other resort islands were also sold as their owners were unable to meet the cost of renovations. The destruction of resorts in the Whitsundays triggered a sharp decline in Australian tourism revenue. Decades later, Ada is still regarded as a "defining" event in the development of the Whitsunday region. In 2016, <a href="electoral%20district%20of%20Whitsunday">Whitsunday</a> MP <a href="Jason%20Costigan">Jason Costigan</a> advocated for erecting a memorial to Ada's victims, and community members formed a small committee exploring this possibility in early 2017.

The Riddle of the Sphinx (Inside No. 9)

"The Riddle of the Sphinx" is the third episode of the third series of the British <a href="dark%20comedy">dark comedy</a> <a href="anthology%20series">anthology</a> television programme "<a href="Inside%20No.%209">Inside No. 9</a>". It first aired, on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>, on 28 February 2017. The episode was written by the programme's creators, <a href="Steve%20Pemberton">Steve Pemberton</a> and <a href="Reece%20Shearsmith">Reece Shearsmith</a>, and directed by <a href="Guillem%20Morales">Guillem Morales</a>. "The Riddle of the Sphinx", which is set in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, stars <a href="Alexandra%20Roach">Alexandra Roach</a> as Nina, a young woman seeking answers to the "<a href="Varsity%20%28Cambridge%29">Varsity</a>" <a href="cryptic%20crossword">cryptic crossword</a>, Pemberton as Professor Nigel Squires, who <a href="pseudonymously">pseudonymously</a> sets the crossword using the name <a href="the%20Sphinx">"Sphinx"</a>, and Shearsmith as Dr Jacob Tyler, another Cambridge academic. The story begins with Nina surreptitiously entering Squires's rooms on a stormy night and being discovered; this leads to Squires teaching her how to decipher clues in cryptic crosswords.

The plot of "The Riddle of the Sphinx" revolves around the clues and answers to a particular crossword puzzle. The idea to focus an episode on crosswords came from Pemberton; he had long been a fan of cryptic crosswords, but particular inspiration came from "Two Girls, One on Each Knee: The Puzzling, Playful World of the Crossword", a non-fiction book by <a href="Alan%20Connor">Alan Connor</a>. The crossword featured in "The Riddle of the Sphinx" was set by Pemberton, and was published in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" on the day the episode aired, credited to "Sphinx". This crossword contains multiple ninas—hidden messages or words. Along with many of the crossword's answers, one nina is integral to the episode's plot. A second was introduced accidentally, and then incorporated into the episode. A third nina is an "Inside No. 9" <a href="in-joke">in-joke</a>.

Influences for "The Riddle of the Sphinx", which emphasises <a href="gothic%20fiction">gothicism</a> over <a href="comedy">comedy</a>, include <a href="Anthony%20Shaffer%20%28writer%29">Anthony Shaffer</a>'s 1970 play "<a href="Sleuth%20%28play%29">Sleuth</a>", the work of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a>, and the 1989 film "<a href="The%20Cook%2C%20the%20Thief%2C%20His%20Wife%20%26amp%3B%20Her%20Lover">The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover</a>". Critics responded extremely positively to the episode, lauding its writing and the precise attention to detail in the production. Commentators noted that the episode was very dark, and probably the cleverest episode of "Inside No. 9" to date. Roach's performance was praised, as was the direction of Morales.

The third series of "<a href="Inside%20No.%209">Inside No. 9</a>" was announced in October 2015, and heavily publicised in January 2016, at which time <a href="Alexandra%20Roach">Alexandra Roach</a> was named as a guest star in the series. The series began with the Christmas special "<a href="The%20Devil%20of%20Christmas">The Devil of Christmas</a>" (December 2016) and continued with "<a href="The%20Bill%20%28Inside%20No.%209%29">The Bill</a>" (February 2017), the latter of which was the first of a run of five episodes, of which "The Riddle of the Sphinx" was the second. The episode was first aired on 28 February 2017. It was shown on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> at 10:00pm, clashing with first episode of the third series of "<a href="Catastrophe%20%282015%20TV%20series%29">Catastrophe</a>", the acclaimed <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> comedy.

"The Riddle of the Sphinx" was written in the summer of 2015, one of the last of the series, and was filmed in December that year. Most of the episode was filmed in <a href="Langleybury">Langleybury</a>, a country house in <a href="Abbots%20Langley%2C%20Hertfordshire">Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire</a>, which had previous been used for the "Inside No. 9" episodes "<a href="The%20Harrowing%20%28Inside%20No.%209%29">The Harrowing</a>" and "<a href="S%C3%A9ance%20Time">Séance Time</a>", as well as the house of Oscar Lomax in the Shearsmith and Pemberton television series "<a href="Psychoville">Psychoville</a>". The <a href="Establishing%20shot">opening exterior shot</a> was filmed in a <a href="quad%20%28architecture%29">court</a> of <a href="Gonville%20and%20Caius%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge</a>. The idea to set the episode during a storm, which gave it a <a href="gothic%20fiction">gothic</a> quality, was Morales's. For Shearsmith and Pemberton, this was an example of an advantage to having a third party direct episodes, in contrast to "<a href="Cold%20Comfort%20%28Inside%20No.%209%29">Cold Comfort</a>" and "<a href="Nana%27s%20Party">Nana's Party</a>" from the second series, which they had directed themselves. Close-up shots of the crossword and the blackboard were filmed later, some on the set of "<a href="Private%20View%20%28Inside%20No.%209%29">Private View</a>", which introduced potential <a href="Continuity%20%28fiction%29">continuity</a> problems. The episode was filmed after two days' rehearsals. The script was 32 pages in length, resulting in a first cut that was 38 minutes long. The BBC permitted the final version to be a little longer than the half hour typical of "Inside No. 9", but the production team still needed to lose several minutes in the edit. The final run-time for the episode is 31 minutes and 35 seconds.

"The Riddle of the Sphinx" was characterised by Pemberton as a <a href="Thriller%20%28genre%29">thriller</a> in the style of <a href="Anthony%20Shaffer%20%28writer%29">Anthony Shaffer</a>'s 1970 play "<a href="Sleuth%20%28play%29">Sleuth</a>", while Shearsmith identified the episode as particularly theatrical, in the style of "Sleuth" and <a href="Ira%20Levin">Ira Levin</a>'s 1978 play "<a href="Deathtrap%20%28play%29">Deathtrap</a>". BBC executives, according to Shearsmith, saw the episode as a cross between "Sleuth" and <a href="Willy%20Russell">Willy Russell</a>'s 1980 play "<a href="Educating%20Rita">Educating Rita</a>" that read as if it had been authored by <a href="psychopathy">psychopaths</a>. The <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> <a href="Jon%20Plowman">Jon Plowman</a> suggested that the first half of the episode plays out like a <a href="radio%20play">radio play</a>. The word-play and tea-drinking in this part of the episode are, in the writers' opinion, very English; the episode then changes character. Civilisation is "stripped away", resulting in the episode having the elements of a <a href="Greek%20tragedy">Greek tragedy</a>. A further inspiration was the 1989 film "<a href="The%20Cook%2C%20the%20Thief%2C%20His%20Wife%20%26amp%3B%20Her%20Lover">The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover</a>"; at the end of the episode, Squires faces a situation that mirrors one faced by <a href="Michael%20Gambon">Michael Gambon</a>'s Albert Spica.

An initial idea for the plot saw only two characters, but a third, for the writers, introduced a compelling dynamic; keeping the cast small also served to keep production costs relatively low. The episode stars Roach as Nina, Pemberton as Professor Nigel Squires—whose name is a reference to the crossword setter <a href="Roger%20Squires">Roger Squires</a>—and Shearsmith as Dr Jacob Tyler. Roach and Shearsmith had previously collaborated on the television programme "<a href="Hunderby">Hunderby</a>". Roach said in an interview before the episode's airing that she is drawn to darker scripts; she said that she loves "Inside No. 9", describing the episodes as "very gruesome, psychological thrillers, [which] always have great twists". She described Nina as highly <a href="naivete">naive</a>. Two <a href="body%20double">doubles</a> were used in the episode in place of Roach. One was used in the exterior shot at the start of the episode; a second was a "bottom double" seen towards the episode's close.

Shearsmith identified "The Riddle of the Sphinx" as one of his two favourite episodes of the series, along with "The Devil of Christmas". For the writers, the episode was not comedic, and they expressed awareness of the differences between episodes of "Inside No. 9" like "The Riddle of the Sphinx" and the expectations of viewers for television comedies. The pair acknowledged the particular complexity of the plot, with Pemberton saying "If you missed two sentences in a row, you'd be like 'what?' Even I was thinking how are people following this? It's insane."

Pemberton had long been a fan of <a href="cryptic%20crossword">cryptic crossword</a>s, and he was inspired to develop the episode by reading "Two Girls, One on Each Knee: The Puzzling, Playful World of the Crossword", a non-fiction book by <a href="Alan%20Connor">Alan Connor</a>. Pemberton had first met Connor through an appearance on the BBC <a href="game%20show">game show</a> "<a href="Only%20Connect">Only Connect</a>", on which the latter was working as a question setter. Subsequently, he received a copy of Connor's book. Reading "Two Girls, One on Each Knee" led Pemberton to ask whether one could "dramatize doing a crossword, which is so un-dramatic?" Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith relish the challenge set by writing limitations, such as basing an episode around a crossword. Such constraints, he felt, encourage them to produce their best work.

With assistance from Connor, Pemberton compiled the crossword around which the episode revolves. Connor was credited as the episode's "Crossword consultant"; further assistance was provided by <a href="Hugh%20Stephenson">Hugh Stephenson</a>, crossword editor for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>". The puzzle contains a range of themed entries and ninas—hidden words or messages—making it a particularly challenging crossword for a first-time designer. Pemberton began with "ISWAPPEDCUPS", the key nina, and two of the long themed words ("PUFFERFISH" and "ASPHYXIATION"). He then experimented with remaining clues, and was able to include "MYSTERYGUEST", "KNOWITALL", "UNDERSLIP" and "NEUN". The episode's second nina was created accidentally and seen at the last minute; by introducing a middle name for Pemberton's character, the writers were able to make it a part of the plot. At least one of the clues used in the episode—Squires's improvised "I teach wild creature without hospital building", resulting in "ARCHITECTURE"—was not a good one. This was acknowledged by Squires in the episode, but was kept in as it reflected Squires's view of his own actions.

Pemberton hoped that "The Riddle of the Sphinx" would work as a mini-tutorial for cryptic crosswords. Shearsmith, meanwhile, had never attempted a cryptic crossword before working on the episode, but has subsequently started completing them. Nonetheless, Pemberton acknowledged that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence "I always hated cryptic crosswords. Why can't people just say what they mean instead of trying to trick you all the time?" from Shearsmith's Tyler. In an interview with Connor, published after "The Riddle of the Sphinx" had aired, Pemberton explored the ways in which writing for "Inside No. 9" was like writing for a cryptic crossword; in both cases, misdirection is key and utterly arbitrary choices or happenings can serve as important inspirations.

In the <a href="Audio%20commentary">DVD commentary</a> for the episode, Shearsmith and Pemberton expressed a hope that Pemberton's crossword could be published before the episode's airing, so that viewers would be able to watch the episode having unknowingly already completed the crossword around which it revolves. Pemberton's crossword was published in "The Guardian" on the same day that the episode aired, credited to "Sphinx"; for one critic, this explained and justified the answer "MYSTERYGUEST". The collaboration between "Inside No. 9" and "The Guardian" drew inspiration from the collaboration between "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" for "<a href="Homer%20and%20Lisa%20Exchange%20Cross%20Words">Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words</a>" in 2008. Pemberton dedicated the crossword, which was his first in print, to the late <a href="Kenny%20Ireland">Kenny Ireland</a>. The two of them had completed the "Guardian" crossword daily while filming together for the television comedy "<a href="Benidorm%20%28TV%20series%29">Benidorm</a>". Allowing a one-off contribution from a non-regular setter was deeply unusual for "The Guardian", whose crosswords are normally produced by one of about 25 regular setters. Pemberton, again writing as "Sphinx", went on to publish a further cryptic crossword in "The Guardian" in 2018, during the airing of the fourth series of "Inside No. 9". The puzzle worked independently of any references to "Inside No. 9", but included "an extra layer for ["Inside No. 9"] viewers".

On a stormy night, Nina lets herself in to a <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> room, where she is found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, but it is not loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the rooms of Squires—a <a href="classicist">classicist</a> who sets crosswords for "<a href="Varsity%20%28Cambridge%29">Varsity</a>" as "the Sphinx"—to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: "I teach wild creature without hospital building" results in "ARCHITECTURE", which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the <a href="Sphinx">Sphinx</a> because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was, he says, "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered "DOWNANDOUT" and "WRAP"; Squires answers "DESI" and helps with "TRENT". Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; her excuse is that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce "SWAMPLANDS", meaning "bog". Nina, though, suggests that it should be "bogs", otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She now displays clear proficiency, answering "ASPHYXIATION".

Squires drops his cup, as Nina continues to fill in the crossword, including "<a href="Mr.%20Sowerberry">SOWERBERRY</a>" and "KNOWITALL". Squires is apparently paralysed in his chair, watching. Nina is a <a href="marine%20biologist">marine biologist</a>, and has acquired <a href="tetrodotoxin">tetrodotoxin</a> from a <a href="pufferfish">pufferfish</a>, which causes <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a> and <a href="asphyxiation">asphyxiation</a>. Simon was actually Nina's brother, and is visible on the photo of Squires and his wife. Simon had reached a crosswording final only to be beaten by Squires after the latter challenged that a "u" looked more like a "v". Depressed by the defeat, Simon had killed himself. Squires, to Nina's shock, is unharmed. He leaps up to fill out "NEUN" and "ASPS", revealing the nina "ISWAPPEDCUPS" within the crossword. As Nina induces vomiting, Squires makes a phone call. He had been warned by Dr Jacob Tyler, an old friend and Nina's <a href="Supervisor%23Academia">supervisor</a>. Squires places Nina—for whom paralysis is setting in—on a chair, and goes back to the crossword, filling out "UNDERSLIP"; asking about the underwear young women wear, he slides his hand up Nina's skirt and kisses her on the mouth.

Nina is left alone until Tyler enters. He tells Charlotte—"Nina"—to hang on, before turning to the crossword. With Squires, he works out "MYSTERYGUEST". Tyler reveals that he has no antidote for Charlotte, and will not call the emergency services. Instead, he wants Squires to eat Charlotte, as the Sphinx would. Tyler tells Squires that he cannot call the police, as the crossword displays <a href="premeditation">premeditation</a>: the "KNOWITALL" received a "MYSTERYGUEST" at number "NEUN", resulting in "ASPHYXIATION". Tyler reveals "PUFFERFISH", predicting, with reference to crossword answers, that a "DOWN AND OUT" will find Charlotte wrapped in her "UNDERSLIP" in "SWAMPLANDS", incriminating Squires. This is, Tyler says, his revenge.

Tyler cuts from Charlotte's buttocks, frying a strip of her flesh on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, destroying Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh; he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals that he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a>—Tyler explains—revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, reminding Squires of the principle of <a href="Chekhov%27s%20gun">Chekhov's gun</a>. Squires confirms that his middle name is "Hector" as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: "RIPNHS".

"The Riddle of the Sphinx" is less comedic than many episodes of "Inside No. 9", drawing upon <a href="gothic%20horror">gothic</a> themes. Several critics identified "Sleuth"—"a grandfather of sorts" to "Inside No. 9"—as a key influence. <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Titus%20Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a>", the 1973 horror film "<a href="Theatre%20of%20Blood">Theatre of Blood</a>", and the work of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a> were also identified as possible influences. Chekhov and his work are referenced in the episode; <a href="Chekhov%27s%20gun">Chekhov's gun</a> is referred to in the closing seconds, while Squires identifies the gun in the episode as from a production of "<a href="The%20Seagull">The Seagull</a>", which was authored by Chekhov. This play, like "The Riddle of Sphinx", features a character named Nina and a gunshot suicide. Mark Butler, writing for <a href="inews.co.uk">inews.co.uk</a>, noted the references to <a href="Greek%20tragedy">Greek tragedy</a>, arguing that the episode "followed a long tradition of <a href="grotesque">grotesque</a> dramatic reveals".

"<a href="Al%20Hirschfeld%23Nina">Nina</a>", as well as being the name of a character in the episode, is a name given by cruciverbalists—crossword enthusiasts—to hidden messages in crosswords, such as Squires's "ISWAPPEDCUPS". The character of Nina is reminiscent of <a href="Eliza%20Doolittle">Eliza Doolittle</a>, with Squires acting as Henry Higgins. The episode explicitly references <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>'s play "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28play%29">Pygmalion</a>", from which these characters originate, while Squires's language echoes that of Higgins in "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>", the <a href="Musical%20film">musical</a> adaptation of the play.

Butler and the comedy critic <a href="Bruce%20Dessau">Bruce Dessau</a> suggested that the crossword answers may contain a hidden political message. On the episode's audio commentary, Shearsmith denied that the nina "RIPNHS" should be read as a political statement, namely "<a href="Rest%20In%20Peace">Rest In Peace</a> <a href="National%20Health%20Service">National Health Service</a>". Similarly, in his interview with Connor, Pemberton noted that "most people" think that the nina is political, but that it was an accidental introduction, and only woven into the plot once the crossword had been completed. The political commentator <a href="Kerry-Anne%20Mendoza">Kerry-Anne Mendoza</a> reached out to the BBC for comment on the apparent political message; a BBC spokesperson clarified that "NHS are the initials of the professor in question who takes his own life", and subsequently that the apparent political message was "genuinely a complete coincidence".

Every episode of "Inside No. 9" features an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, "Because each episode is so wildly different there was nothing really linking them other than the fact they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought it would be nice to have an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." There is no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible, though not clearly, in "The Riddle of the Sphinx" on a table in Squires's fireplace. There is also a "second" hare; though it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown at the end of the episode, the crossword published in "The Guardian" contains a nina spelling "ONELEPUS", "<a href="Lepus">Lepus</a>" being the <a href="genus">generic name</a> for hares.

Critics responded very positively to "The Riddle of the Sphinx", which was variously called a "brilliant episode" of "Inside No. 9", comfortably the best thus far of the third series, and even "one of the best" episodes ever. It was praised by Ben Lawrence of <a href="Telegraph.co.uk">Telegraph.co.uk</a> for its "near brilliance", while Dessau characterised it as a "beautiful constructed playlet". At the end of the fourth series, Butler listed "The Riddle of the Sphinx" as the second strongest episode of "Inside No. 9", describing it as "sheer brilliance". He listed "<a href="The%2012%20Days%20of%20Christine">The 12 Days of Christine</a>" as the strongest.

The episode was widely noted as both very dark, and very clever. Dessau characterised it as the cleverest episode of "Inside No. 9", and the freelance journalist Dan Owen described it as "undoubtedly the most complex and surprising instalment of ["Inside No. 9"], favouring attention to detail and narrative precision"; similarly, Mellor called it "the most complicated tale "Inside No. 9" has ever spun". The plot offered "much to admire" for crossword fans, but viewers' enjoyment, it was suggested, may depend on how much they enjoy crosswords. The latter half of the episode introduced a very wide array of twists; Owen speculated that the episode could lose viewers at the end due to its "minimal hand-holding", suggesting that there may have been too many twists. "If you missed just one line of dialogue", he explained, "it would've left you scrambling to understand exactly what's going on between the three characters".

Nonetheless, the episode was, for Owen, "a writing masterclass", created with considerable skill, and with a plot that held together even when scrutinised. Mellor, similarly, praised the intelligence of the plot, provided one takes "on faith the unlikely notion that a mother and her new husband would have no contact with her children from a previous marriage, not even recognising them as adults". "From the lightning flashes that punctuate hints and story shifts to the wordplay and in-jokes peppered through the script", Mellor said, the episode is highly precise. Butler called the episode's ending one of "Inside No. 9" darkest and most bizarre. Some, he suggested, "may have found it a bit too unpalatable", though he added that the plot and ironic humour suggested that viewers can "can perhaps avoid taking it too seriously". Morales received particular praise for his attention to detail and foreshadowing of future events in the episode, with Mellor explaining that he and the writers

continually draw our attention to the key props of the gun and the teacups. The camera follows Squires' gun to his desk drawer and we're kept aware of its presence thanks to Nina and Squires' "If I’d shot you, here in the dark/With an empty gun? Good luck" exchange. Nina is shown drinking from the poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls Squires "devious" (a hint at her true feelings about him) and once again when she emphasises the word "plan". While Squires is telling the story of the Sphinx and she seems to be gazing at the statue of it, she's actually looking at the photograph of her brother on display directly below.

The actors' performances were also commended, with particular praise for Roach, who was characterised as "funny, likeable and endearingly crude as Nina, then captivating and clever when the charade drops". Patrick Mulkern, writing for <a href="RadioTimes.com">RadioTimes.com</a>, also praised the "zingy funny lines" in the earlier part of the episode, and Butler commended the "smart, gentle humour" offered by the contrast between Nina and Squires.

Henry W. Sawyer

Henry Washington Sawyer III (December 23, 1918 – July 31, 1999) was an American lawyer, <a href="Civil%20and%20political%20rights">civil rights</a> activist, and <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> politician. Born in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, he served in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and attended the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20Law%20School">University of Pennsylvania Law School</a>. Sawyer worked as a corporate lawyer but is best known for his advocacy of <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a>, especially in <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> cases. In "<a href="Abington%20School%20District%20v.%20Schempp">Abington School District v. Schempp</a>" and "<a href="Lemon%20v.%20Kurtzman">Lemon v. Kurtzman</a>", he successfully argued cases before the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> that became the basis for all modern <a href="Establishment%20Clause">Establishment Clause</a> jurisprudence. He pursued civil rights causes in Philadelphia and in the South during the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> of the 1960s. He also served a four-year term on <a href="Philadelphia%20City%20Council">Philadelphia City Council</a>, where he worked for <a href="Merit%20system">civil service reform</a> and to increase the amount of <a href="public%20art">public art</a> in the city.

Sawyer was born in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in 1918, the son of Henry Washington Sawyer II and his wife, Helen Curet Sawyer. Although he was a <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>, Sawyer's family had a tradition of military service dating to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> when his immigrant grandfather, the first Henry Washington Sawyer, served in the <a href="1st%20New%20Jersey%20Volunteer%20Cavalry">1st New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry</a>. After the war, Sawyer's grandfather became the owner of the <a href="Cape%20May%20Historic%20District">Chalfonte Hotel</a> in <a href="Cape%20May%2C%20New%20Jersey">Cape May, New Jersey</a>. Sawyer's father, Henry Sawyer II, died in the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a> two months before his son was born, and Sawyer was raised by his mother, a school teacher, in Philadelphia's <a href="Germantown%2C%20Philadelphia">Germantown</a> neighborhood. He attended high school at <a href="Chestnut%20Hill%20Academy">Chestnut Hill Academy</a>, graduating in 1936. After graduation, Sawyer enrolled at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> (Penn) where he wrote for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Pennsylvanian">The Daily Pennsylvanian</a>," joined the <a href="Zeta%20Psi">Zeta Psi</a> fraternity, and was a member of <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>.

He graduated in 1940 and started at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20Law%20School">Penn law school</a> that same year. At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Sawyer was commissioned in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. He served in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, but later said that he saw very little combat. Most of his service was aboard the , a <a href="fleet%20oiler">fleet oiler</a>. In July 1945, Sawyer was transferred to , a <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>, on which he served until December of that year. After the war, he returned to law school and graduated in 1948. While in school, he married Grace Scull in 1946. They remained married until her death in 1999 and had three children together: two sons, Jonathan and Henry, and a daughter, Rebecca.

After graduation, Sawyer joined the law firm of <a href="Drinker%20Biddle%20%26amp%3B%20Reath">Drinker Biddle & Reath</a>, where he remained for his entire career. Shortly after joining the firm, he was assigned to work as a temporary assistant district attorney in the <a href="O%27Malley%20Case">O'Malley Case</a>, a prosecution of political corruption in the city (the Philadelphia district attorney's office at that time was mostly staffed by part-time employees drawn from firms as needed). Working under lead prosecutor <a href="Laurence%20Howard%20Eldredge">Laurence Howard Eldredge</a> and alongside assistant prosecutor <a href="Lemuel%20Braddock%20Schofield">Lemuel Braddock Schofield</a>, Sawyer assisted in the trial of Chief Magistrate <a href="John%20J.%20O%27Malley%20%28magistrate%29">John J. O'Malley</a> for 206 counts of <a href="misfeasance">malfeasance</a> in office. O'Malley was found not guilty in two trials in 1948 and 1949. Sawyer was called back into the Navy in 1950 during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and later as a foreign service officer in Europe. He returned to Philadelphia in 1953.

As a lawyer, Sawyer focused on civil litigation in corporate law, at which he excelled. He also spent much of his time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several volunteer ("pro bono") defense attorneys in the case of "United States v. Kuzma," a prosecution of <a href="Communism">Communist</a> sympathizers under the <a href="Smith%20Act">Smith Act</a>, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> overturned the Smith Act in "<a href="Yates%20v.%20United%20States">Yates v. United States</a>."

Sawyer argued again in favor of someone accused of communist sympathies in "<a href="Deutch%20v.%20United%20States">Deutch v. United States</a>". Sawyer's client, Bernhard Deutch, was a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania who was subpoenaed by the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> in 1954. Deutch answered most of the committee's questions about his own former membership in the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party</a> as an undergraduate at <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a>, but declined to answer questions about other members of the party, asserting that his "moral scruples" prevented him from doing so. The House found Deutch in <a href="Contempt%20of%20Congress">contempt</a>, and the charge was upheld in federal district court. The <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit">D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals</a> affirmed the conviction, which Sawyer appealed to the Supreme Court. To his surprise, they took the case and reversed the conviction on the grounds that the government failed to prove "the pertinence of the questions". In an article written after Sawyer's death, Judge <a href="Stewart%20Dalzell">Stewart Dalzell</a> credited Sawyer's skillful argument in persuading the Court to overturn the conviction.

In 1957, Pennsylvania law required that school <a href="School%20prayer">students read Bible verses</a> to start the day. The <a href="Abington%20School%20District">Abington School District</a> added another requirement that the students read the <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>. Several <a href="Unitarian%20Universalism">Unitarians</a> in <a href="Abington%20Township%2C%20Montgomery%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Abington</a>, a suburb of Philadelphia, objected and held a protest against it. One of them, <a href="Ellery%20Schempp">Ellery Schempp</a>, contacted the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> about the issue. The ACLU and Schempp's parents believed the school prayer law violated the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First</a> and <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendments</a> to the United States Constitution. The ACLU's lawyers saw Sawyer, then Board chair and later general counsel of the ACLU's Philadelphia affiliate, as the best choice to argue it, given his skill as a litigator and his success in the "Deutch" case. Sawyer agreed and filed suit in <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Pennsylvania">federal district court</a>.

As described by Judge <a href="Louis%20H.%20Pollak">Louis H. Pollak</a> in a 1999 article, Sawyer's "theory of the case was that the prescribed Bible reading, whether or not followed by the Lord's Prayer, constituted both an <a href="Establishment%20Clause">establishment of religion</a> and an infringement of the <a href="Free%20Exercise%20Clause">free exercise of religion</a> in contravention of the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment." The trial began in 1958 before a three-judge panel. The panel agreed in an opinion written by Judge <a href="John%20Biggs%2C%20Jr.">John Biggs, Jr.</a> After the trial, the state legislature changed the law to allow students to be excused from the Bible readings if they wished. In further hearings in 1962 the court, again in an opinion by Biggs, held that the law still violated the Constitution by allowing the state "to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth."

The Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal by the school district, and Sawyer again argued the case. On June 17, 1963, the Court issued an 8–1 opinion upholding the district court ruling and striking down Pennsylvania's school prayer law. In the opinion by Justice <a href="Tom%20C.%20Clark">Tom C. Clark</a>, the Court enunciated what would become the heart of Establishment Clause jurisprudence: that "to withstand the strictures of the Establishment Clause, there must be a secular legislative purpose and a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion." Pollak credited Sawyer's advocacy at the district court level with helping to win the case: "it is clear that a masterly litigator planted in trial court the seeds of the fruit that was to ripen on appeal."

Sawyer further shaped the church-state landscape a few years later in the case of "<a href="Lemon%20v.%20Kurtzman">Lemon v. Kurtzman</a>." In 1968, Pennsylvania enacted the Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which allowed the state to reimburse non-public schools for education costs, provided that the costs were not incurred in teaching religion. Although the statute specifically barred state funds from paying for "any subject matter expressing religious teaching, or the morals or forms of worship of any sect", civil rights activist <a href="Alton%20Lemon">Alton Lemon</a> believed the law still allowed for the state to effectively fund religious schools, a violation of the Establishment Clause. Sawyer took the case and brought suit in district court.

Again arguing before a three-judge panel, Sawyer was initially unsuccessful. Judge <a href="Emanuel%20Mac%20Troutman">Emanuel Mac Troutman</a>, writing for the panel, explained that under the rules set forth in "Schempp," the Act had a secular purpose and did not fund religion. Sawyer appealed and the Supreme Court granted "<a href="certiorari">certiorari</a>" in 1970. In an opinion handed down on June 28, 1971, the Court held for Sawyer's client and struck down the Pennsylvania law. Chief Justice <a href="Warren%20E.%20Burger">Warren E. Burger</a>, writing for a seven-justice majority, held that "the cumulative impact of the entire relationship arising under the statutes in each State involves excessive entanglement between government and religion."

The test handed down in "Lemon" remains the core of the process for determining whether a state action violates the Establishment Clause. According to the ruling, a statute does not violate the Establishment Clause so long as it has a secular purpose, its principal effect does not advance or inhibit religion, and it does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. After "Lemon," Sawyer was regarded as among the premier appellate litigators. Justice <a href="William%20J.%20Brennan%20Jr.">William J. Brennan Jr.</a> said to Sawyer in 1988 that "few lawyers have equaled your advocacy."

Sawyer and his wife were both <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> in the 1940s. After witnessing <a href="political%20corruption">political corruption</a> and <a href="voter%20fraud">voter fraud</a> in their own ward and around the city, they became disillusioned with the party organization in the city and joined the reform effort led by <a href="Joseph%20S.%20Clark%2C%20Jr.">Joseph S. Clark, Jr.</a>, and <a href="Richardson%20Dilworth">Richardson Dilworth</a>. Clark and Dilworth brought together <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a>, independents, and disaffected Republicans like Sawyer in a coalition against the Republican <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a>, which they regarded as irredeemably corrupt. In 1949, Sawyer served as a Democratic committeeman and Clark and Dilworth won city offices that year.

While Sawyer was serving overseas, the reform coalition swept the Democrats into power in Philadelphia for the first time in 67 years. When he returned to Philadelphia, Clark asked him to run for an at-large seat on City Council <a href="Philadelphia%20municipal%20election%2C%201955">in 1955</a>. By the rules of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only choose five. The result was that the majority party could take only five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Sawyer was elected to one such seat and served a single four-year term. In that position, he sponsored legislation to establish the city's One Percent for Fine Arts program, which required one percent of the cost of construction projects in <a href="Center%20City%2C%20Philadelphia">Center City</a> to be spent on public art. He also worked for the creation of a Police Review Board. City Council did not pass that bill, but Mayor <a href="James%20Hugh%20Joseph%20Tate">James Tate</a> later created the board through an executive order.

Sawyer found himself at odds with the Democratic organization on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The <a href="Pennsylvania%20Supreme%20Court">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> struck down some of the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term <a href="Philadelphia%20municipal%20election%2C%201959">in 1959</a>, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the <a href="Americans%20for%20Democratic%20Action">Americans for Democratic Action</a>, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican <a href="Arlen%20Specter">Arlen Specter</a> for district attorney of Philadelphia.

Beyond strictly legal and political concerns, Sawyer was also interested in the plight of black Americans, and became involved in the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. According to his friend and fellow lawyer, <a href="Arlin%20M.%20Adams">Arlin M. Adams</a>, Sawyer "was troubled by the treatment of blacks in the South." In 1965, he traveled to <a href="Selma%2C%20Alabama">Selma, Alabama</a>, to help register black voters there and in Mississippi, and gave legal representation to activists who were charged with breaking local ordinances. Closer to home, he also sued the <a href="Philadelphia%20Police%20Department">Philadelphia Police Department</a> and its commissioner, <a href="Frank%20Rizzo">Frank Rizzo</a>, over allegations that black applicants to the police academy were being unfairly rejected. Sawyer represented nine black applicants in a series of cases that spanned nearly a decade, culminating in court-ordered measures to ensure greater racial diversity on the force. In 1972, he again sued Rizzo (who was by then Mayor of Philadelphia) over improper funding of the city workers' pension fund. As Sawyer's son Jonathan recalled in 1999, "a magazine printed Rizzo's top-10 enemies, and my father was on the list. He was very proud that he made it."

Sawyer served on the boards of many civic organizations, including the <a href="World%20Affairs%20Councils%20of%20America">World Affairs Council of Philadelphia</a>, the Episcopal Hospital, the <a href="Delaware%20River%20Port%20Authority">Delaware River Port Authority</a>, and the <a href="Fairmount%20Park%20Art%20Association">Fairmount Park Art Association</a>. He also had a passion for <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, hosting a jazz radio show and teaching a course on it at his alma mater, Penn. His wife, Grace, died in May 1999, and Sawyer died on July 31 of that year from <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>.

6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia

The 6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia was a peacetime <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="regiment">regiment</a> that was activated for federal service in the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> army for three separate terms during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The regiment gained notoriety as the first unit in the Union army to suffer fatal casualties in action during the Civil War in the <a href="Baltimore%20Riot%20of%201861">Baltimore Riot</a> and the first militia unit to arrive in <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> in response to President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln's</a> initial <a href="President%20Lincoln%27s%2075%2C000%20volunteers">call for 75,000 troops</a>. Private <a href="Luther%20C.%20Ladd">Luther C. Ladd</a> of the 6th Massachusetts is often referred to as the first Union soldier killed in action during the war.

In the years immediately preceding the war and during its first enlistment, the regiment consisted primarily of <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> from <a href="Middlesex%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Middlesex County</a>. During its first term of service, four out of ten companies of the regiment were from <a href="Lowell%2C%20Massachusetts">Lowell, Massachusetts</a>. <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Edward%20F.%20Jones">Edward F. Jones</a> commanded the regiment during its first term. He later commanded the <a href="26th%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry">26th Massachusetts</a> and was awarded the honorary grade of <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>. During its second and third terms of service, the unit was commanded by Colonel Albert S. Follansbee.

The regiment first enlisted for a "90-day" term of service which lasted from April 16 to August 2, 1861. Following their engagement in the Baltimore Riot, the 6th Massachusetts proceeded to Washington and then returned to <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a> to guard locations within the city as well as the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> station at <a href="Elkridge%2C%20Maryland">Elkridge, Maryland</a>. Their second term of service lasted nine months from August 1862 to June 1863. During this time the 6th Massachusetts was attached to the <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">VII Corps</a> and participated in several expeditions and actions in the vicinity of <a href="Suffolk%2C%20Virginia">Suffolk, Virginia</a>, most notably the <a href="Siege%20of%20Suffolk">Siege of Suffolk</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrsville">Battle of Carrsville</a> in April and May 1863. Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt's bravery at Carrsville earned him the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. The 6th Massachusetts served a third term in response to the call for troops to defend fortifications around Washington. During this term, which lasted 100 days from July to October 1864, the 6th Massachusetts <a href="garrison">garrison</a>ed <a href="Fort%20C.%20F.%20Smith%20%28Arlington%2C%20Virginia%29">Fort C. F. Smith</a> in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a> and guarded Confederate prisoners of war at <a href="Fort%20Delaware">Fort Delaware</a> near the mouth of the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a>.

The 6th Massachusetts regiment that served during the Civil War was formed in 1855 during the reorganization of the Massachusetts militia. Other units dating back to the 18th century were given the designation 6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia. They were formed and disbanded at various times and although they shared the same numerical designation, there was no continuous unit known as the 6th Massachusetts. One of the units designated as the 6th Massachusetts was a regiment that served during <a href="King%20George%27s%20War">King George's War</a> in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Louisbourg%20%281745%29">Siege of Louisbourg</a> in 1745. During the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>, the <a href="6th%20Massachusetts%20Regiment">6th Massachusetts Regiment</a> was engaged in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Harlem%20Heights">Battle of Harlem Heights</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trenton">Battle of Trenton</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a>.

Shortly after <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> issued its <a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Immediate%20Causes%20Which%20Induce%20and%20Justify%20the%20Secession%20of%20South%20Carolina%20from%20the%20Federal%20Union">Declaration of Secession</a>, Massachusetts Governor <a href="John%20A.%20Andrew">John A. Andrew</a> anticipated imminent civil war and issued an order on January 16, 1861, to the ten existing Massachusetts units of peacetime militia to immediately reorganize and prepare for active service. Colonel Edward F. Jones was the first militia commander to respond to the Governor's order. His letter indicating the regiment's readiness, dated January 21, was brought to <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a> and read in the <a href="Massachusetts%20Senate">Massachusetts Senate</a> by then state Senator <a href="Benjamin%20F.%20Butler">Benjamin F. Butler</a>.

On April 15, 1861, three days after <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> forces fired on <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, <a href="President%20Lincoln%27s%2075%2C000%20volunteers">President Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteers</a> to serve in putting down the insurrection. The call was relayed by Governor Andrew to the existing regiments of Massachusetts militia the same day. Eight companies of the original 6th Massachusetts (one from <a href="Acton%2C%20Massachusetts">Acton</a>, one from <a href="Groton%2C%20Massachusetts">Groton</a>, two from <a href="Lawrence%2C%20Massachusetts">Lawrence</a>, and four from Lowell) gathered in Lowell on April 16 and proceeded to Boston. That night, the men of the 6th Massachusetts barracked in <a href="Faneuil%20Hall">Faneuil</a> and <a href="Boylston%20Hall%20%28Boston%29">Boylston Halls</a>. The next morning, April 17, three companies previously belonging to other Massachusetts militia units (one from Boston, one from <a href="Stoneham%2C%20Massachusetts">Stoneham</a>, and another from <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester</a>) were added to the 6th Massachusetts to form a regiment of 11 companies total. Thus composed entirely of existing volunteer militia companies, the 6th Massachusetts was made up of volunteer soldiers. The regiment proceed that day to the <a href="Massachusetts%20State%20House">State House</a>, where Governor Andrew presented regimental <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">colors</a> to Colonel Jones. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston for Washington via railroad at 7 p.m. on April 17.

On April 19, 1861, the 6th Massachusetts boarded train cars in <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a> in the early morning hours and departed for Washington via Baltimore. Before the end of the day, the regiment saw combat during the Baltimore Riot. The date was the anniversary of the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a> which began the American Revolution.

Although Maryland remained in the Union, <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secessionist</a> sentiment and support for the Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of <a href="sabotage">sabotage</a> to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause <a href="derailment">derailment</a> and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.

Trains passing through Baltimore at that time could not proceed directly through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at <a href="President%20Street%20Station">President Street Station</a> on the east side of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on <a href="Pratt%20Street">Pratt Street</a> by horsepower to <a href="Camden%20Station">Camden Station</a> on the west side of Baltimore's <a href="Inner%20Harbor">Inner Harbor</a>, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.

The blockage of the railroad left four companies, numbering 220 men, at President Street Station with no choice but to march through the city to reach Camden Station, slightly more than one mile away. The size of the crowd obstructing their path was estimated at roughly 10,000. <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">Captain</a> Follansbee, the senior captain, took charge of the detachment. After crossing the Pratt Street Bridge, which had been partially dismantled by the crowd, Follansbee ordered his men to march at the "double-quick." This roused the crowd further as they perceived the quickened pace as an indication of panic. As well as stones and bricks being thrown, shots were now fired at the 6th Massachusetts from the stores and houses around them. Captain Follansbee gave the order to return fire.

Seventeen-year-old Private Luther C. Ladd, a factory worker from Lowell, was hit in the head by a piece of scrap iron that was thrown from a rooftop and fractured his skull. As he staggered, one of the rioters took Ladd's musket from him and fired, wounding him in the leg. Ladd died on Pratt Street. He is known as the first Union soldier to be killed in action during the Civil War. Three other militiamen were killed during the riot: Private Addison O. Whitney, Private Charles A. Taylor and Corporal Sumner H. Needham. A total of 36 members of the 6th Massachusetts were wounded.

A formation of approximately 50 officers of the <a href="Baltimore%20Police%20Department">Baltimore Police</a> eventually placed themselves between the rioters and the militiamen, allowing the 6th Massachusetts to proceed to Camden Station. The companies boarded the train which quickly got underway for Washington, though the crowd followed the train for some miles attempting to stop it. A total of 12 civilians were killed during the riot and an unknown number were injured.

The 6th Massachusetts reached Washington D.C. on April 19, 1861, the first unit to arrive in response to Lincoln's call for troops. A large, cheering crowd welcomed them at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station which once stood north of the <a href="US%20Capitol">Capitol</a>. Among the crowd was <a href="Clara%20Barton">Clara Barton</a> who became a famed nurse during the Civil War. At the time a clerk in the <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">U.S. Patent Office</a>, Barton gained her first experience in caring for wounded soldiers as she tended to injured men of the 6th Massachusetts.

The 6th Massachusetts was barracked in the <a href="Old%20Senate%20Chamber">Senate Chamber</a> in the Capitol. The next morning, tensions in Washington were high as rumors circulated of an impending Confederate attack. After reviewing the 6th Massachusetts, Lincoln expressed his anxiety to the members of the regiment, telling them, "I don't believe there is any North. The Seventh Regiment [New York] is a myth. Rhode Island is not known in our geography any longer. You are the only northern realities."

In the days and weeks after the Baltimore Riot, newspapers and politicians across the country drew comparisons between the Massachusetts militia who had fought on April 19, 1775, at the start of the Revolution and the Massachusetts troops who fought on April 19, 1861. Among the 6th Massachusetts were descendants of those <a href="Minutemen">Minutemen</a> who had fought in Lexington and Concord in 1775. Due to the coincidence of the date and the ancestry of some members, the 6th Massachusetts was often called the "Minutemen of '61."

The 6th Massachusetts remained in Washington until May 5, when they were assigned to garrison a key railroad relay station about 15 miles outside of Baltimore at <a href="Elkridge%2C%20Maryland">Elkridge</a>. Their presence there helped keep open the crucial rail line from the northeastern states to Washington.
The regiment returned to Baltimore on May 13, when <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> Benjamin F. Butler occupied the city with several Union regiments in anticipation of a Confederate attack on Baltimore which never developed. The 6th Massachusetts marched through the city to <a href="Federal%20Hill%2C%20Baltimore">Federal Hill</a>, where they set up camp for a short stay of three days. On May 16, the regiment returned to the Elkridge relay station. They served out the majority of their term at the relay station and vicinity, except for a second assignment in Baltimore from June 26 to July 1, 1861.

The regiment's return to Boston at the close of their 90-day term was delayed slightly by special request of Major General <a href="Nathaniel%20P.%20Banks">Nathaniel P. Banks</a>. In light of the recent Union defeat at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a>, in which the 6th Massachusetts did not participate, he asked the regiment voluntarily remain at Elkridge another week in the event of a Confederate advance on Washington. On July 29, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to break camp and boarded trains for Boston which was reached on August 1. The regiment was mustered out on August 2, 1861.

The regiment was again activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven of the ten original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was necessary in order to fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term. To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term. Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at <a href="Camp%20Chase%20%28Massachusetts%29">Camp Henry Wilson</a> in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship "Plymouth Rock." Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.

 Upon reaching Washington, the regiment was ordered to <a href="Fortress%20Monroe">Fortress Monroe</a> and from there to <a href="Suffolk%2C%20Virginia">Suffolk, Virginia</a>. The 6th Massachusetts was assigned to the Second Brigade (commanded by Colonel <a href="Robert%20Sanford%20Foster">Robert S. Foster</a>) of the First Division of the <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">VII Corps</a>. They served garrison and <a href="Picket%20%28military%29">picket</a> duty in the vicinity of Suffolk, occasionally taking part in reconnaissance expeditions to the <a href="Blackwater%20River%20%28Virginia%29">Blackwater River</a> (which represented the boundary between the Union occupied counties of southeast Virginia and Confederate territory of the interior) and engaged in minor skirmish actions.

Their first such expedition took place on October 3, 1862, about two weeks after the regiment reached Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts formed a peripheral part of the <a href="Joint%20Expedition%20against%20Franklin">Expedition against Franklin</a>, a joint effort of the U.S. Army and Navy to dislodge a growing force of Confederates threatening the Union garrison at Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts held a road near <a href="Western%20Branch%2C%20Virginia">Western Branch Church</a>, far from the main action at Franklin, and here loaded their muskets for the first time in action. Although the 6th Massachusetts did not see any combat during their first expedition, and many members recalled it as tedious, the sight of ambulances carrying dead and wounded from the battle made a strong impression on the new recruits. During a second expedition to the Blackwater on December 11, 1862, the 6th Massachusetts was lightly engaged near <a href="Zuni%2C%20Virginia">Zuni, Virginia</a> and lost their first casualty in battle during their second enlistment—2nd Lieutenant Robert G. Barr. The regiment did not again leave Suffolk until an expedition on January 29, 1863, again towards the Blackwater River. Confederates opposed this Union advance on January 30 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Deserted%20House">Battle of Deserted House</a> in an isolated location about ten miles west of Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts was sharply engaged and lost five killed and seven wounded.

The majority of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees in front of the defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.

In early 1863, Major General <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a> was given command of the Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His objectives were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the <a href="Siege%20of%20Suffolk">Siege of Suffolk</a> on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied a position on the right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the <a href="Nansemond%20River">Nansemond River</a>. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.

On May 3, 1863, Longstreet abandoned the siege and began moving his forces north to rejoin the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>. The next day, the 6th Massachusetts was among the units sent in pursuit of the retreating Confederate force. Only minor skirmishing took place as the bulk of the Confederate force had already escaped beyond reach of the Union infantry. The 6th Massachusetts took about 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the <a href="Somerton%20Historic%20District">Somerton</a> Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters.

Major General <a href="John%20Adams%20Dix">John A. Dix</a>, commanding Union forces at Suffolk, conducted several reconnaissances in force to determine the disposition of Confederate forces remaining in the region. On May 13, the 6th Massachusetts joined another expedition to the Blackwater River. This was the final action of their second term of service. The column was commanded by Major General Foster and Colonel Follansbee was promoted to command of the <a href="brigade">brigade</a> to which the 6th Massachusetts belonged. A considerable Confederate force attacked the Union expedition in a sharp engagement on May 14–15, 1863, known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrsville">Battle of Carrsville</a> or the Battle of Holland House. During this fight, the 6th Massachusetts supported the 7th Massachusetts Battery and exchanged in heavy, prolonged firing with the Confederates. The 6th Massachusetts made an advance, driving the enemy into the woods, then were driven back and made a second counter-attack, reclaiming their position at the start of the battle. The regiment suffered casualties of five killed or mortally wounded, twelve wounded and five prisoners.

In the middle of the battle, when the 6th Massachusetts was driven back, Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt of Company C perceived that several of his comrades had been hit and were left in the woods. In an effort to pull them out, he rushed forward, towards the Confederate position. In this action, he earned the Medal of Honor. According to his citation, "When ordered to retreat, this soldier turned and rushed back to the front, in the face of heavy fire from the enemy, in an endeavor to rescue his wounded comrades, remaining by them until overpowered and taken prisoner." Sweatt was eventually released; the three men he endeavored to rescue did not survive.

On May 18, the 6th Massachusetts and other regiments fell back to Deserted House outside of Suffolk. On May 20 they were posted in support of artillery at <a href="Windsor%2C%20Virginia">Windsor, Virginia</a>. Finally, on May 23, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to return to Massachusetts. The regiment reached Boston by steamship on May 26 to be welcomed and addressed in front of the State House by Governor Andrew. The 6th Massachusetts then proceeded to Lowell, where they were received with enthusiastic festivities. The regiment reassembled on June 3, 1863, at Camp Wilson and were mustered out. In all during their second enlistment, the regiment lost 13 men killed or mortally wounded in combat and 18 by disease.

In May 1864, Major General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> removed fresh troops from the defensive fortifications of Washington and transferred them into the field to strengthen the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>. To man defenses around the capital in their place, and to relieve regiments at various northern fortifications, Lincoln issued a call for 500,000 troops to serve a brief term of 100 days. This measure would allow enough time to raise longer-term regiments to occupy rearward defenses. The 6th Massachusetts was activated for a third time in response to this call for 100-day regiments.

The regiment organized at <a href="Camp%20Meigs">Camp Meigs</a> in <a href="Readville%2C%20Massachusetts">Readville, Massachusetts</a>, just outside of Boston beginning July 13, 1864. Colonel Follansbee again commanded the regiment. The roster of field and staff officers was fundamentally the same as their previous nine-month term of service. They departed on July 20 for Washington, reaching the city on July 22. They were posted on <a href="Arlington%20Heights%20Historic%20District">Arlington Heights</a> in <a href="Fort%20C.%20F.%20Smith%20%28Arlington%2C%20Virginia%29">Fort C.F. Smith</a>. Their month of service there was mundane, consisting of regular drills, inspections and fatigue duty.

On August 21, 1864, the regiment was ordered to move. They traveled by rail to Philadelphia and by steamship to <a href="Fort%20Delaware">Fort Delaware</a> on <a href="Pea%20Patch%20Island">Pea Patch Island</a> on the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a>. The regiment relieved the <a href="157th%20Ohio%20Infantry">157th Ohio Infantry</a> and commenced garrison and guard duty over the 7,000 Confederate prisoners of war held at Fort Delaware. There had been widespread instances of mistreatment of prisoners by Union units that previously garrisoned the fort, including abuse and theft of prisoners' property. Members of the 6th Massachusetts condemned these practices and generally refrained from similar abuses. Their duty consisted of standing post and escorting prisoners on various work details. The fort was large and in excellent condition. The barracks were newly constructed, comfortable, and included a library and other amenities. The field and staff officers as well as several company officers were joined by their wives and children at the post. The regimental historian recorded that many members of the unit remember their time at Fort Delaware as extremely pleasant.

On October 19, 1864, the 6th Massachusetts was relieved and began the journey back to Boston, which they reached on October 21. The regiment reported to Camp Meigs on October 27, 1864, and were mustered out for the third and last time. During their third term, the regiment lost 10 men to disease.

Shortly after the bodies of Privates Luther Ladd and Addison Whitney were brought home to Lowell, Massachusetts, after the Baltimore Riot, city officials began planning the construction of a monument honoring their sacrifice and memorializing the first casualties of the Civil War. An appropriation of $2,000 was secured from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a further $2,700 was provided by the city. The monument was constructed in front of the Lowell courthouse in what is now known as Monument Square. Ladd and Whitney had both been buried in the <a href="Lowell%20Cemetery">Lowell Cemetery</a>. On April 28, 1865, their remains were re-interred in a vault beneath the monument. The monument was to be dedicated on April 19, 1865, on the anniversary of the Baltimore Riot, but the ceremonies were delayed due to the <a href="assassination%20of%20President%20Lincoln">assassination of President Lincoln</a>. It was instead dedicated on the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, a local holiday, June 17, 1865. The procession numbered more than 4,500 people. Governor Andrew gave the oration acknowledging the men whom he called "the first martyrs of the great rebellion."

The 6th Massachusetts continued as a peacetime militia unit following the Civil War, typically meeting for annual musters at various camps in Massachusetts. During reorganizations of the Massachusetts militia in 1866 and 1877, the 6th Massachusetts was consolidated and some of its companies disbanded or transferred, but the regimental organization remained intact. The regiment was again activated during the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>. The <a href="6th%20Massachusetts%20Regiment%20%28Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War%29">6th Massachusetts</a> of 1898 participated in the <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20Campaign">Puerto Rican Campaign</a>.

The <a href="181st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">181st Infantry Regiment</a>, which was formed from elements of other units and first inducted into federal service on January 16, 1941, claims lineage from the 6th Massachusetts and other militia units. As of 2017, the 1st Battalion of this regiment was active as an element of the <a href="Massachusetts%20National%20Guard">Massachusetts National Guard</a>.

Guilden Morden boar

The Guilden Morden boar is a sixth- or seventh-century <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> copper alloy figure of a <a href="Wild%20boar">boar</a> that may have once served as the crest of a helmet. It was found around 1864 or 1865 in a grave in <a href="Guilden%20Morden">Guilden Morden</a>, a village in the eastern English county of <a href="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a>. There the boar attended a skeleton with other objects, including a small earthenware bead with an incised pattern, although the boar is all that now remains. <a href="Herbert%20Fordham">Herbert George Fordham</a>, whose father originally discovered the boar, donated it to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> in 1904; as of 2018 it was on view in 

The boar is simply designed, distinguished primarily by a prominent mane; eyes, eyebrows, nostrils and tusks are only faintly present. A pin and socket design formed by the front and hind legs suggests that the boar was mounted on another object, such as a helmet. Such is the case on one of the contemporary <a href="Torslunda%20plates">Torslunda plates</a> found in Sweden, where boar-crested helmets are depicted similarly.

Boar-crested helmets are a staple of Anglo-Saxon imagery, evidence of a <a href="Germanic%20mythology">Germanic tradition</a> in which the boar invoked the protection of deities. The Guilden Morden boar is one of three—together with the helmets from <a href="Benty%20Grange%20helmet">Benty Grange</a> and <a href="Pioneer%20Helmet">Wollaston</a>—known to have survived to the present, and it has been exhibited both domestically and internationally. The Guiden Morden boar recalls a time when such decoration may have been common; in the Anglo-Saxon poem "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", where boar-adorned helmets are mentioned five times, <a href="Hrothgar">Hrothgar</a> speaks of when "our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action."

The Guilden Morden boar is simply designed and well preserved. Made of cast bronze or copper alloy, it is approximately long and distinguished by little other than a prominent mane. An eye, eyebrows and nostrils leave slight traces and were possibly punched after the boar was cast, while a tusk is indicated on the boar's right side. The tail once formed a full circle but was broken around 1904.

The front two and back two legs were each cast as one piece, yet where a deep socket was hollowed into the front piece, a long pin extends down from the back piece. The resultant pin and socket design would allow the boar to be mounted on another object, particularly a helmet.

The boar was found around 1864 or 1865 in Guilden Morden, a parish in Cambridgeshire about south west of <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and west of <a href="Royston%2C%20Hertfordshire">Royston</a> in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. It was found by Herbert Fordham, co-managing partner at a successful family brewery, while digging for <a href="coprolite">coprolite</a>s, a particularly rich <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> then used as fertiliser and the pursuit of which effectively provided the only employment other than agriculture in Cambridgeshire. Writing about the boar in 1904, his son <a href="Herbert%20Fordham">Herbert George Fordham</a> suggested that:

A drawing made between April 1882 and September 1883, held by the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, shows the boar alongside a bronze ring and two glass beads, one amber-coloured, the other red with white inlay. Underneath the images it is noted that the items were "all found in a grave with a doubled-up skeleton". Fordham had had no further information about the discovery of the boar, its location or the associated (and now lost) objects, and donated the boar to the British Museum in 1904.

The boar is displayed in Room 41 of the British Museum. The gallery covers Europe from 300 to 1100 AD, and includes objects such as the finds from the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> <a href="ship%20burial">ship-burial</a> and the <a href="Lycurgus%20Cup">Lycurgus Cup</a>. In addition to its place at the British Museum, the Guilden Morden boar has been shown in both domestic and international exhibitions. From 1 April to 30 October 2004, the boar was displayed at the Sutton Hoo Visitor Centre in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> as part of "Between Myth and Reality". It was again exhibited from 26 July to 16 October 2013, this time at the <a href="Di%C3%B6zesanmuseum%20Paderborn">Diözesanmuseum Paderborn</a> () in <a href="Paderborn">Paderborn</a>, Germany, as part of "CREDO: Christianisierung Europas im Mittelalter" (Christianisation of Medieval Europe).

The Guilden Morden boar is of <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> origin, so marked by the additional items found in the grave, and by comparable helmets discovered elsewhere in England, although until 1977 it was misidentified as <a href="Celts">Celtic</a>. It was likely once mounted atop a boar-crested helmet, a number of which have been either found in archaeological excavations or seen in artistic depictions. Two other boar-crested helmets are known—from <a href="Benty%20Grange%20helmet">Benty Grange</a> and from <a href="Pioneer%20Helmet">Wollaston</a>—and the Guilden Morden boar is a close parallel of the boar fixed to the former. The Benty Grange boar has a similar shape; it has a long and distinctive elongated snout projecting forward, a similar stance, and front and hind legs each joined as one. It dates to approximately 650 to 700 AD and the Wollaston helmet to the time around 675 AD, although a date more specific than the sixth or seventh century AD has not been suggested for the Guilden Morden boar.

Understood in its broader context, the boar would likely have adorned an early model of the "crested helmets" known in Northern Europe in the sixth through eleventh centuries AD. Though the remains of fifty such helmets are known, most are from <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and only five from the Anglo-Saxon period are preserved enough that their original form can be determined. These, the helmets from Benty Grange, <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>, <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">Coppergate</a>, Wollaston and <a href="Staffordshire%20helmet">Staffordshire</a>, may have shared similarities with the helmet to which the Guilden Morden boar was attached. Scandinavian helmets are also depicted artistically with boar crests, such as on one of the four <a href="Torslunda%20plates">Torslunda plates</a> found in Sweden. The boars atop the helmets worn by the two warriors on the plate are highly similar to the one from Guilden Morden, and similarly appear to be fastened to their helmets with a pin and socket device.

The <a href="Wild%20boar">boar</a> was an important symbol in prehistoric Europe, where it was "venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time." Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after <a href="La%20T%C3%A8ne">La Tène</a> examples in the fourth century BC, <a href="Gauls">Gaulish</a> specimens three centuries later, and Roman boars in the fourth century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a <a href="mother%20goddess">mother goddess</a> figure among linguistically Celtic communities in <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> Europe, while the Roman historian <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the <a href="Balts">Baltic</a> <a href="Aesti">Aesti</a> wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium <a href="Gundestrup%20cauldron">Gundestrup cauldron</a>, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made some five hundred years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols—four <a href="Roman%20legion">legions</a>, including the <a href="Legio%20XX%20Valeria%20Victrix">twentieth</a>, adopted it as their emblem—it was only one among many. The boar nonetheless persisted in continental <a href="Germanic%20mythology">Germanic tradition</a> during the nearly 400 years of <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman rule in Britain</a>, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods <a href="Freyja">Freyja</a> and <a href="Freyr">Freyr</a>. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and <a href="Horncastle%20helmet%20fragment">Horncastle</a>, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>" poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them.

The Guilden Morden boar recalls the Anglo-Saxon poem "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", where helmets with boar imagery are referenced five times. In three cases they appear to feature freestanding boars atop the helmets, like the Guilden Morden example. Such is the case when <a href="Grendel%27s%20mother">Grendel's mother</a> seeks vengeance for the death of <a href="Grendel">her son</a>.

In another case, <a href="Hrothgar">Hrothgar</a> laments the death of <a href="%C3%86schere">Æschere</a>, "my right-hand man when the ranks clashed and our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action" (""). Both instances likely refer to crests such as those on the Benty Grange or Wollaston helmets, or to the one found in Guilden Morden.

Gevninge helmet fragment

The Gevninge helmet fragment is the <a href="Dexter%20and%20sinister">dexter</a> eyepiece of a helmet from the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a> or end of the <a href="Nordic%20Iron%20Age">Nordic Iron Age</a>. It was found in 2000 during the <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavation</a> of a Viking farmstead in <a href="Gevninge">Gevninge</a>, near <a href="Lejre">Lejre</a>, Denmark. The fragment is moulded from bronze and <a href="gilded">gilded</a>, and consists of a stylised eyebrow with eyelashes above an oval opening. There are three holes at the top and bottom of the fragment to affix the eyepiece to a helmet. The fragment is significant as rare evidence of contemporaneous helmets, and also for its discovery in Gevninge, an outpost that is possibly connected to the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> epic "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>". It has been in the collection of the <a href="Lejre%20Museum">Lejre Museum</a> since its discovery, and has been exhibited internationally as part of a travelling exhibition on <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a>.

The fragment is an ornate piece, but nothing else remains of the helmet; it might be the single remnant of a disintegrated helmet, or it might have been lost or discarded. It is one of two <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n eyepieces discovered alone, giving rise to the suggestion that it was intentionally deposited in an invocation of the one-eyed god <a href="Odin">Odin</a>. It would have been part of a decorated "crested helmet", the type of headgear that was common to England and Scandinavia from the sixth through eleventh centuries AD. These are particularly known from the examples found at <a href="Vendel">Vendel</a>, <a href="Valsg%C3%A4rde">Valsgärde</a>, and <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>; the <a href="Tjele%20helmet%20fragment">Tjele helmet fragment</a> is the only other Danish example known.

Gevninge is upriver from Lejre, a one-time centre of power believed to be the setting for <a href="Heorot">Heorot</a>, the fabled mead hall to which the poetical hero <a href="Beowulf%20%28hero%29">Beowulf</a> journeys in search of the monster <a href="Grendel">Grendel</a>. The settlement's location suggests that it functioned as an outpost through which anyone would have to pass when sailing to the capital, and in which trusted and loyal guardians would serve. This mirrors Beowulf's experience on his way to Heorot, for upon disembarking he is met with a mounted lookout whose job it is "to watch the waves for raiders, and danger to the Danish shore." Upon answering his challenge, Beowulf is escorted down the road to Heorot, much as an Iron Age visitor to Lejre might have been led along the road from Gevninge. The Gevninge helmet fragment, a military piece from a riverside outpost, therefore sheds light on the relationship between historical fact and legend.

The Gevninge eyepiece is wide and tall, moulded from bronze and <a href="Gilding">gilded</a>. An oval eye opening is overlain by a sculpted eyebrow with grooves representing individual hairs; grooves around the perimeter of the oval might represent eyelashes. The top and bottom of the fragment each have three holes, presumably used to attach it to the helmet where it would have formed the <a href="Dexter%20and%20sinister">dexter</a> eyepiece. The top three holes might have attached it to the helmet cap, the bottom three to some form of face protection such as a face mask or <a href="Aventail">camail</a>.

The Gevninge helmet fragment was discovered by itself, with no other nearby artefacts to give it some context. The settlement at Gevninge dates to between 500 and 1000, while helmets with similar decorative characteristics suggest dating the eyepiece to the sixth or seventh century, perhaps from 550 to 700; another helmet eyebrow discovered in <a href="Upp%C3%A5kra">Uppåkra</a>, Sweden, has the same suggested date. The Gevninge fragment fits into the corpus of <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n "crested helmets", each characterized by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose-to-nape crest. The <a href="Tjele%20helmet%20fragment">Tjele helmet fragment</a> is the only such helmet found in Denmark, while the richly ornamented helmets found at <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>, <a href="Vendel">Vendel</a>, and <a href="Valsg%C3%A4rde">Valsgärde</a> may provide the closest approximation to what the Gevninge helmet would have looked like when whole.

Helmets like that which the Gevninge fragment once adorned served both as utilitarian equipment and as displays of status. Examples from Northern Europe during the Nordic Iron Age and Viking Age are rare. This may partly suggest a failure to survive a millennium underground or perhaps a failure to be recognised after excavation: the plainer Anglo-Saxon and <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> helmets from <a href="Shorwell%20helmet">Shorwell</a> and <a href="Burgh%20Castle">Burgh Castle</a> were initially misidentified as pots. The extreme scarcity nevertheless suggests that they were never deposited in great numbers, and that they signified the importance of those wearing them. In the Anglo-Saxon poem "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", a story about kings and nobles that partly takes place in Denmark, helmets are mentioned often, and in ways that indicate their significance. The dying words of <a href="Beowulf%20%28hero%29">Beowulf</a>, whose own pyre is stacked with helmets, are used to bestow a gold collar, <a href="Mail%20%28armour%29">byrnie</a>, and gilded helmet to his follower <a href="Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a>.

If protection was all that was asked of a helmet, a simple iron cap would suffice. Yet a soldier guarding Gevninge, a riverside outpost on the way to the major city of <a href="Lejre">Lejre</a>, would have to be trustworthy, and perhaps also connected to the king by family or loyalty. He would also occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge fragment would have identified the rank of such a person, as well as adding decoration to a helmet.

The fragment was discovered in 2000 with the use of a metal detector during a minor <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavation</a> in <a href="Gevninge">Gevninge</a>, a <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a> settlement and modern-day village in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> to the west of <a href="Roskilde">Roskilde</a>. The excavation was in response to the planned construction of houses on an undeveloped hectare of land in the middle of the village, but it unexpectedly revealed a farmstead with several buildings.

The eyepiece might have been made at nearby Lejre, the seat of the <a href="Scylding">Scylding</a> kings during the Iron and Viking ages. It was discovered in the topsoil and might have been lost or discarded, or the entire helmet might have become buried and then been destroyed by ploughing. It might also have been deliberately buried, as was the helmet eyebrow from Uppåkra. If buried alone, it might have been an allusion to the one-eyed god <a href="Odin">Odin</a> who sacrificed an eye in exchange for wisdom and intelligence in <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>.

The <a href="Roskilde%20Museum%23Museums%20for%20Lejre%2C%20Gunds%C3%B8%20and%20Frederikssund">Lejre Museum</a> now displays the Gevninge fragment alongside other seventh-century grave finds from the area. The fragment was exhibited in Denmark and internationally from 2013 to 2015 as part of a major exhibition on the Vikings, starting at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Denmark">National Museum of Denmark</a>. It then travelled to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> for "Vikings: Life and Legend", then to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>'s <a href="Martin-Gropius-Bau">Martin-Gropius-Bau</a> for "Die Wikinger".

The discovery of the fragment in Gevninge is notable for its proximity to Lejre, down the river from <a href="Roskilde%20Fjord">Roskilde Fjord</a>. Lejre was once a centre of power, as evidenced by monumental burial mounds, large halls, the silver-filled Lejre Hoard, and <a href="stone%20ship">stone ship</a>s. For the last hundred years Lejre has also been understood as the most likely setting for <a href="Heorot">Heorot</a>, the great <a href="mead%20hall">mead hall</a> of the Danes in the Anglo-Saxon <a href="Epic%20poetry">epic poem</a> "Beowulf", to which Beowulf travels in search of <a href="Grendel">Grendel</a> and <a href="Grendel%27s%20mother">Grendel's mother</a>. In this sense, Gevninge could have been "the Port of Lejre", standing guard against anyone who sailed towards the capital. Indeed, Beowulf and his men are met by such a guard when they disembark in Denmark:

The watchman is a "noble warrior" () who, after listening to Beowulf's explanation of his voyage, directs his men to watch the hero's boat and offers to escort him to king Hrothgar. He then turns back stating, "I'm away to the sea, back on alert against enemy raiders" (). Whether or not Gevninge was the basis for the coastal outpost encountered in "Beowulf", the two filled similar roles. They would have also been subject to similar strategic considerations, being both early lines of defence against attack, and places to welcome the flow of visitors. In this way, the fragment provides a nexus between legend and historical fact.

Waterloo Medal (Pistrucci)

The Waterloo Medal was designed by Italian-born sculptor <a href="Benedetto%20Pistrucci">Benedetto Pistrucci</a>. He worked on it from 1819 to 1849, when the completed <a href="matrix%20%28numismatics%29">matrices</a> were presented to Britain's <a href="Royal%20Mint">Royal Mint</a>. The medal was commissioned by the British Government in 1819 on the instructions of <a href="George%20IV">George IV</a> while <a href="Prince%20Regent">Prince Regent</a>; copies were to be presented to the generals who had been victorious in the 1815 <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>, and to the leaders of Britain's allies. As most of the intended recipients had died by 1849, and relations with France had improved, the medals were never struck, though modern-day editions have been made for sale to collectors.

In 1816, the Prince Regent had first suggested a medal to be presented to allies and commanders from Waterloo. The <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> proposed work by <a href="John%20Flaxman">John Flaxman</a>, one of its members, but Pistrucci, whose responsibility it was to engrave the <a href="glossary%20of%20numismatics%23D">dies</a>, refused to copy another's work, and brought forth designs of his own. The Prince Regent and <a href="William%20Wellesley-Pole">William Wellesley-Pole</a>, <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Mint">Master of the Mint</a> were impressed by Pistrucci's models, and he gained the commission.

Pistrucci fell from grace at the Royal Mint in 1823 by refusing to copy another's work for the coinage, and he was instructed to concentrate on the medal. He likely concluded that he would be sacked if he completed it, and progress was extremely slow. Health issues also played a part. He stayed on at the Mint, the medal uncompleted, despite repeated calls from Masters of the Mint to finish the project. In 1844, the Master, <a href="W.%20E.%20Gladstone">W. E. Gladstone</a>, reached an accord with Pistrucci and the medal matrices were eventually submitted in 1849. Due to their great size, in diameter, the Mint was unwilling to risk damaging the matrices by hardening them, and only <a href="electrotype">electrotype</a>s and soft impressions were taken. Pistrucci's designs have been greatly praised by <a href="numismatic">numismatic</a> writers.

On 28 June 1815, ten days after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> in June 1815, the victorious general, <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">the Duke of Wellington</a> proposed to <a href="Frederick%2C%20Duke%20of%20York">Frederick, Duke of York</a> that bronze medals be presented to the British soldiers at Waterloo, silver to their officers and gold to the sovereigns of the victorious nations, and to their generals and ministers. Wellington's brother was <a href="William%20Wellesley-Pole">William Wellesley-Pole</a>, the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Mint">Master of the Mint</a>, and Wellesley-Pole at once ordered designs prepared for <a href="Waterloo%20Medal">the soldiers' medal</a>. In early 1816, it was decided that officers and soldiers alike would receive their medal in silver, and it was produced in large numbers by the <a href="Royal%20Mint">Royal Mint</a> for the military. The <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> was taxed with recommending a design for the gold medal; they selected a sketch by Sir <a href="John%20Flaxman">John Flaxman</a>, but no action was immediately taken.

In 1816, George, <a href="Prince%20Regent">Prince Regent</a> (later <a href="George%20IV">George IV</a>), pressed the idea of a commemorative medal to be presented to the victorious generals and national leaders of the Battle of Waterloo. It was decided to give this medal in gold to the heads of state and in silver to the victorious generals. Others to be honoured would receive the medal in bronze. Flaxman's design was to be used.

Wellesley-Pole in 1819 instructed <a href="Benedetto%20Pistrucci">Benedetto Pistrucci</a> to engrave Flaxman's work to make steel dies for the medal. Pistrucci, an Italian who had come to Britain in 1815, was performing the duties of <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20Royal%20Mint">Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint</a>. He believed he had been promised the title, which as a foreigner he was ineligible for, and this would be a longtime grievance for him. Pistrucci refused to engrave Flaxman's model, unwilling to copy the work of another artist. This refusal angered the Royal Academy. Pole instead asked Pistrucci to prepare a design of his own, and in a day he had produced wax models, about which the Prince Regent was enthusiastic. In August 1819, Pole received instructions from the Treasury to employ Pistrucci to produce the medal. The fee was £2,400, to be paid in instalments. Pole promised an advance that would allow Pistrucci to bring his family from Rome. According to Carlo Milano in his article on Pistrucci for the Royal Mint, "The Waterloo Medal could not be compared to any previous medal: it was much bigger and its iconography more complicated than had ever been seen before in the history of medallic art. But Pistrucci believed that it could be done and immediately began to work."

The centre of the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> depicts the four allied rulers: George, Prince Regent (although not king, he was exercising the monarch's powers due to the illness of his father, <a href="George%20III">George III</a>), Emperor <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis I</a> of Austria, Tsar <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Alexander I</a> of Russia and King <a href="Frederick%20William%20III%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William III</a> of Prussia.

Aside from the rulers, who are seen grouped in profile, Pistrucci's design for both sides is entirely allegorical, with the subject the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29">treaty of peace</a> concluded after Waterloo. At top of the obverse <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> is seen in his chariot; he restores the day. Following the chariot are <a href="Zephyrus">Zephyr</a>, who scatters flowers, symbolic of peace, and <a href="Iris%20%28mythology%29">Iris</a>. The carriage flies in the sky towards <a href="Castor%20and%20Pollux">Castor and Pollux</a>, representing the constellation <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini</a> and symbolising the period of the <a href="Zodiac">Zodiac</a> when Waterloo took place. The twins are armed with spears, and are meant as the <a href="apotheosis">apotheses</a> of the victorious generals, Wellington and <a href="Gebhard%20Leberecht%20von%20Bl%C3%BCcher">Blücher</a>. <a href="Themis">Themis</a>, the goddess of justice, appears before the rulers, a reminder that justice, more than power, secures their rule. Under her are seen the <a href="Fates">Fates</a>, their subservient position meaning that human fate will henceforth be determined by justice. Opposite Themis, behind the rulers, is a man armed with a club, seated under an oak tree, he represents power. Beneath him are the <a href="Furies">Furies</a>, symbolising that human actions and passions are subject to power, and at the bottom is a figure representing night, fleeing.

The reverse has at centre equestrian figures meant to be Wellington and Blücher, with Victory between them, guiding them to battle. They are in the Grecian style, similar to Pistrucci's earlier <a href="St%20George%20and%20the%20Dragon">St George and the Dragon</a> design for the <a href="sovereign%20%28British%20coin%29">sovereign coin</a>. At the top of the reverse is <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a>. Taking up the rest of the circumference of the medal are 19 figures of giants whom Jupiter has struck down; they are the defeated enemy and number one for every year of the war.

Pistrucci placed inscriptions on the wax model that he did not keep for the final version of the design. Above the royal heads was seen their countries, thus: and below, . On the reverse he placed above and below the figures in the centre: and (the date of the battle). These inscriptions were restored on the version of the medal struck by the Royal Mint in 2015 for the bicentenary of the battle.

In 1822, Pole informed George (who had succeeded to the throne as George IV in 1820) that £1,700 had been paid to Pistrucci, and that the work on the dies was at an advanced stage. King George had strongly disliked the depiction of him Pistrucci had prepared for his coinage. Soon after this, he ordered a new one to be based on a portrait by <a href="Francis%20Chantrey">Francis Chantrey</a>, and Pistrucci refused the instructions to prepare the dies, again declining to copy the work of another artist. The resulting furore endangered his position, causing him to be excluded from further work on the coinage, and Pistrucci was instructed to concentrate on the Waterloo Medal. By 1826, part of one side had been completed. With Pistrucci's role at the Royal Mint now controversial, according to the Royal Mint Museum, "his progress was slow—and deliberately so since he feared that, having put himself beyond the pale by his obstinate behaviour, the Royal Mint would sever its association with him as soon as he handed over the dies."

According to Howard Linecar in his book on British coin designs and designers, "Pistrucci held the cutting of these dies [for the Waterloo Medal] as a bargaining counter in his relentless efforts to obtain the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint". Pistrucci asked each new Master of the Mint for appointment to the position, until in 1828, amid Treasury concerns about how much money was being paid Pistrucci, he was made Chief Medallist, a new position, at a reduced salary; <a href="William%20Wyon">William Wyon</a> became Chief Engraver. Milano wrote, "the Italian artist took this as an act of hostility by his enemies." At about this time, Pistrucci contracted an illness that affected his vision, slowing his work.

The net result was that little work was done on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, <a href="George%20Eden%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Auckland">Lord Auckland</a>, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, <a href="Henry%20Labouchere%2C%201st%20Baron%20Taunton">Henry Labouchere</a>, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be finished in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.

In 1841, a new Master of the Mint, <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a> was appointed. Gladstone thought highly of Pistrucci and corresponded with him in Italian, but was unwilling to grant him any new commissions while the Waterloo Medal remained outstanding. By 1844, the continued expense of Pistrucci was a concern to the Audit Office. Gladstone restored cuts in Pistrucci's pay that had been made for failure to train an apprentice, and offered him a bonus of £400 to complete the medal. Pistrucci was to work solely on the one project. He vacated his home at the Royal Mint, moving to <a href="Old%20Windsor">Old Windsor</a>, where he set up a workshop to attempt the medal's completion. Although Pistrucci worked constantly on the medal during some periods, he was slowed by a fall in his cottage, which incapacitated him for much of 1846. On 1 January 1849, Pistrucci submitted the <a href="matrix%20%28numismatics%29">matrices</a> of the medal to the Royal Mint, and was paid £1,500.

Pistrucci submitted a lengthy letter of advice to aid in hardening the dies, with commentary on other matters interspersed; he had the letter published in the numismatic press. The matrices were each submitted in two pieces, a ring and core, and Pistrucci cautioned that successfully making dies from them was no certainty, "an accident produced by carelessness or inattention might in one moment entirely destroy the whole work, and without remedy". The matrices were in diameter; Mint officials did not think they could be hardened and converted to dies without the likelihood of major damage. A few <a href="electrotype">electrotype</a>s were made from the matrices, along with some soft impressions, but no medals were struck. Improving relations between Britain and France made presentation of medals recalling Waterloo impolitic. Linecar noted that by then "all the great men to whom it was intended that a specimen of the medal should be given were dead, save only <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">the Iron Duke</a>".

Pistrucci was embittered by the experience. He stated in an 1850 letter to <a href="William%20Richard%20Hamilton">William Richard Hamilton</a>:

Linecar said of the Waterloo Medal designs, "that they were one of the most magnificent examples of the die-sinker's art there can be no doubt". Roderick Farey, in his 2014 study of the artist, stated, "Pistrucci's genius is clearly apparent in the design". Milano summed up Pistrucci's matrices, still in the possession of the Royal Mint, as "undoubtedly among the finest pieces in the history of European medals, and a testimony to the genius of their creator". Pistrucci's biographer, Michael A. Marsh, described the medal as "the finest piece of <a href="Intaglio%20%28jewellery%29">intaglio</a> work by any engraver". Several of Pistrucci's wax models, including the definitive final versions, are held by the Museo della Zecca di Roma (the museum of the mint in Rome).

In 1990, the Royal Mint struck a reduced-size collector's version in bronze for the 175th anniversary of the battle. It struck one in silver, also for collectors, for the 200th anniversary in 2015, with Pistrucci's inscriptions from the wax models restored. In 2014, as part of the preparations for the battle's bicentenary, the Worcestershire Medal Service (Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>'s official medallist), on behalf of the London Mint (a private firm) prepared full-size versions in silver. They were presented to the ambassadors of Austria, Russia and Germany (as successor to Prussia), with the Queen to receive one later, and were also made available for sale to the public at £3,900 each. Sir <a href="Evelyn%20Webb-Carter">Evelyn Webb-Carter</a>, chairman of the Waterloo 200 Committee described the medal, weighing , as a "thumping great thing".

Mosaics of Delos

The mosaics of Delos are a significant body of <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20art%23Mosaics">ancient Greek mosaic art</a>. Most of the surviving <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>s from <a href="Delos">Delos</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Aegean%20Islands">an island</a> in the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a>, date to the last half of the 2nd century BC and early 1st century BC, during the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> and beginning of the <a href="Roman%20Greece">Roman period of Greece</a>. Hellenistic mosaics were no longer produced after roughly 69 BC, <a href="Mithridatic%20Wars">due to warfare</a> with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Pontus">Kingdom of Pontus</a> and subsequently abrupt decline of the island's population and position as a major trading center. Among <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic Greek</a> archaeological sites, Delos contains one of the highest concentrations of surviving mosaic artworks. Approximately half of all surviving <a href="Tessellation">tessellated</a> Greek mosaics from the Hellenistic period come from Delos.

The paved walkways of Delos range from simple <a href="pebble">pebble</a> or <a href="chipseal">chip-pavement</a> constructions to elaborate mosaic floors composed of <a href="tesserae">tesserae</a>. Most <a href="Motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motifs</a> contain simple <a href="geometric%20pattern">geometric pattern</a>s, while only a handful utilize the "<a href="opus%20tessellatum">opus tessellatum</a>" and "<a href="opus%20vermiculatum">opus vermiculatum</a>" techniques to create lucid, naturalistic, and richly colored scenes and figures. Mosaics have been found in <a href="Greek%20temple">places of worship</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20architecture">public buildings</a>, and <a href="Oikos">private homes</a>, the latter usually containing either an irregular-shaped <a href="floor%20plan">floor plan</a> or <a href="peristyle">peristyle</a> central courtyard.

Although there are minor traces of <a href="Punic">Punic</a>-<a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romano</a>-<a href="History%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> influence, the Delian mosaics generally conform to the major trends found in <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Hellenistic art</a>. The same wealthy patrons who commissioned paintings and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20sculpture">sculptures</a> at Delos may have also been involved in hiring mosaic artists from abroad. Delian mosaics share characteristics with those in other parts of the Greek world, such as <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonian</a> mosaics in <a href="Pella">Pella</a>. They also bear some attributes with Greek painting traditions and often employ a similar black-background technique found in <a href="red-figure%20pottery">red-figure pottery</a> of the <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical period</a>. Some of the styles and techniques found at Delos are evident in <a href="Roman%20art">Roman art</a> and <a href="Roman%20mosaic">mosaics</a>, although <a href="Roman%20Republic">contemporary Roman</a> examples from <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, for instance, reveal significant differences in the production and design of mosaics in the <a href="Greek%20East%20and%20Latin%20West">western versus eastern Mediterranean</a>.

Precisely 354 <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>s from <a href="Delos">Delos</a> survive and have been studied by French archaeologist . Most date to the late <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a>, contiguous with the late <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> (i.e. the last half of the 2nd century BC and early 1st century BC). A handful were dated to the <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical period</a>, with one mosaic attributed to the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Imperial Roman era</a>. Bruneau believed that nominally undated pieces, on the basis of their styles, were produced within the same period as majority of examples, roughly between 133 and 88 BC. In 167 or 166 BC, after the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> victory in the <a href="Third%20Macedonian%20War">Third Macedonian War</a>, Rome ceded the island of Delos to the <a href="History%20of%20Athens">Athenians</a>, who expelled most of the original inhabitants.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Corinth%20%28146%20BC%29">Roman destruction of Corinth</a> in 146 BC allowed Delos to at least partially assume the former's role as the premier trading center of <a href="History%20of%20Greece">Greece</a>. Delos' commercial prosperity, construction activity, and population waned significantly after the island was assaulted by the forces of <a href="Mithridates%20VI%20of%20Pontus">Mithridates VI</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Pontus">Pontus</a> in 88 and 69 BC, during the <a href="Mithridatic%20Wars">Mithridatic Wars</a> with Rome. Despite the invasions by Pontus, the island was only gradually abandoned after Rome secured a more <a href="Roman%20commerce">direct trading link</a> with the <a href="Orient">Orient</a> that marginalized Delos as a pivotal midway point <a href="Indo-Roman%20trade%20relations">for trade</a> leading <a href="Sino-Roman%20relations">to the East</a>.

The composition of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple <a href="pebble">pebble</a> constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of <a href="tesserae">tesserae</a>. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, <a href="Tessellation">tessellated</a> "<a href="opus%20tessellatum">opus tessellatum</a>" using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight by eight millimeters, and the finer "<a href="opus%20vermiculatum">opus vermiculatum</a>" using pieces of tesserae smaller than four by four millimeters. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in 55 homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into <a href="cement">cement</a> floors; other <a href="flooring">flooring</a> bases are composed of either <a href="rammed%20earth">rammed earth</a> or <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a> <a href="flagstone">flagstone</a>s. Pavements in <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20cuisine">kitchens</a> and <a href="latrine">latrine</a>s were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments for the purpose of <a href="waterproofing">waterproofing</a>. Thin strips of <a href="lead">lead</a> set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.
While some mosaics have been unearthed from <a href="Greek%20temple">religious sanctuaries</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20architecture">public buildings</a>, most of them were found in <a href="Oikos">residential buildings and private homes</a>. The majority of these houses possess an irregular-shaped <a href="floor%20plan">floor plan</a>, while the second largest group were built with a <a href="peristyle">peristyle</a> central courtyard. Simple mosaics were usually relegated to normal walkways, whereas rooms designated for receiving guests featured more richly decorated mosaics. However, only 25 houses of Delos feature "opus tessellatum" mosaics and only eight houses possess the "opus vermiculatum"-style <a href="Motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motifs</a> and figured scenes. The vast majority of decorated floors feature only simple geometric patterns. It is also more common for "opus vermiculatum" and "opus tessellatum" mosaics to be found in upstairs rooms than on the ground floors of ancient Delian homes. With the exception of the House of Dionysos and House of the Dolphins, the courtyards of peristyle homes in Delos feature only floral and geometric motifs.
Among the various patterns and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored <a href="lozenge">lozenge</a> that creates a three-dimensional illusion of cubes in <a href="Perspectivity">perspective</a> for the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, making it one of the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while major themes include <a href="Maritime%20history">maritime</a>, <a href="History%20of%20theatre">theatrical</a>, <a href="Natural%20environment">natural</a>, or <a href="Greek%20mythology">mythological</a> objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Hellenistic art</a>, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and can be found at other sites such as <a href="Arsameia">Arsameia</a> (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The <a href="Rosette%20%28design%29">rosette</a> motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic <a href="palmette">palmette</a> motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette motif. The illusion of three-dimensional <a href="relief">relief</a> in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of <a href="polychrome">polychrome</a>, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.

The origins of the composition, techniques, layout, and style of Delian mosaics can be found in 5th-century BC pebble mosaics of <a href="Olynthus">Olynthus</a> in the <a href="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</a> of northern Greece, with mosaics positioned in the center of cement floors and utilizing garland, meander, and wave patterns around a centralized motif or figured scene. This design scheme is similar to that of 4th-century BC mosaics of <a href="Pella">Pella</a> in <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, although the pebble mosaics there employ a wider range of colors to create the effects of volume. The transition from pebble mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics perhaps originated in Hellenistic-<a href="Greek%20Sicily">Greek Sicily</a> during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as <a href="Morgantina">Morgantina</a> and <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a>. Much like Olynthus, mosaics of Morgantina contain the garland, wave, and meander patterns, although the latter was finally executed with <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>.

Aside from a symbol of the <a href="Punics">Punic-Phoenician</a> goddess <a href="Tanit">Tanit</a>, all pavement motifs are typically <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic Greek</a> in origin, although some pavement mortars used with tesserae designs betray some <a href="Culture%20of%20ancient%20Rome">Italian influence</a>. The three major ethnic groups of Delos included <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> (largely of Athenian origin), <a href="History%20of%20Syria">Syrians/Phoenicians</a>, and <a href="Italians">Italians</a>/<a href="History%20of%20Rome">Romans</a>, but it is very likely that many of these Italians were <a href="Italiotes">Italiotes</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Greek-speaking</a> natives of <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a> in what is now <a href="southern%20Italy">southern Italy</a>. Delian inhabitants of either Greek, Italian, and Syrian origins owned mosaics in their private households, but Vincent J. Bruno asserts that the designs of their mosaic artworks were indebted entirely to Greek artistic traditions.

The French archaeologist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Chamoux">François Chamoux</a> considered the mosaics of Delos as the "high-water mark" and pinnacle of ancient Greek mosaic art utilizing tesserae to create rich, detailed and colorful scenes. This Hellenistic style of mosaic continued until the <a href="Late%20Antiquity">end of Antiquity</a> and may have influenced the widespread use of mosaics in the <a href="Western%20world">Western world</a> during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. In her study of the households and artworks of Mediterranean trading centers, Birgit Tang analyzed three archaeological sites: Delos in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>, <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> in what is now modern <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, and <a href="Emporion">Emporion</a>, modern <a href="Emp%C3%BAries">Empúries</a> in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, which was once a <a href="Colonies%20in%20antiquity">Greek colony</a>. The reasons for her choosing these sites in particular for investigation and comparison include their status as major maritime trading hubs as well as their relatively well-preserved <a href="ruins">ruins</a> of urban households.

Ruth Westgate writes that Delos contains roughly half of all surviving tessellated Greek mosaics from the Hellenistic period. In her estimation the sites of Delos and Morgantina and <a href="Soluntum">Soluntum</a> in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> contain the largest amount of surviving evidence for Hellenistic Greek mosaics. Hariclia Brecoulaki asserts that the Delos mosaics represent the single largest collection of Greek mosaics. She also states that only the <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonian</a> capital of Pella ranks as an equal in having private homes (as opposed to royal residences) decorated with elaborate wall paintings, <a href="Signature">signed</a> mosaics, and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20sculpture">freestanding marble sculptures</a>. <a href="Katherine%20M.%20D.%20Dunbabin">Katherine M. D. Dunbabin</a> writes that while many Hellenistic mosaics have been found in <a href="mainland%20Greece">mainland Greece</a>, <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and northeast Africa (i.e. <a href="Cyrene%2C%20Libya">Cyrene</a>), it is only at the site of Delos where they occur in "sufficient numbers to allow general conclusions about their use and nature."

In her comparative analysis of mosaic art in the <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greco-Roman world</a>, Hetty Joyce chose the mosaics of Delos and <a href="Roman%20art">Roman</a> <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> as chief representative samples for determining distinctions in the form, function, and production techniques of mosaics in the <a href="Greek%20East%20and%20Latin%20West">Greek East and Latin West</a>. Her reasoning for the selection of these two sites are their well-preserved pavements, the secure dating of the samples to the late 2nd and early 1st centuries BC, and, thanks to the extensive documentation of Delian mosaics by Bruneau, a sufficient amount of academic literature dedicated to each site to form comparisons. Ruth Westgate, in her survey and comparative study of Hellenistic Greek mosaics with mosaics of Pompeii, concludes that the <a href="Roman%20mosaic">Roman mosaic</a>s, dated to the <a href="Pompeian%20Styles">Pompeian First Style</a> of wall painting in the late 2nd and early 1st centuries BC, were derived from the Greek tradition. However, she stresses that Pompeian mosaics departed from their Greek counterparts by almost exclusively featuring figured scenes instead of abstract designs, in plain pavement most likely set by local craftsmen and produced separately from the figured panels, the latter of which were perhaps made by Greek artisans for their Roman patrons.

Due to the similarities between the Hellenistic wall paintings at Delos and the First Style of Pompeii, Joyce contends that the differences in Delian and Pompeian mosaics are the deliberate product of artistic preference rather than the result of ignorance of each other's traditions. These differences include the widespread use of "<a href="opus%20signinum">opus signinum</a>" at Pompeii, with only four known examples at Delos; the use of "<a href="opus%20sectile">opus sectile</a>" at Pompeii and its complete absence at Delos; the prevalent use of polychrome patterns and intricate, three-dimensional figured designs in Delian mosaics versus two-dimensional designs at Pompeii, which at best utilize two colors. Complex three-dimensional figured mosaics using polychrome designs to achieve the illusion of light and shadow were not produced at Pompeii until the <a href="Roman%20wall%20painting%20%28200%20BC%E2%80%93AD%2079%29">Pompeian Second Style</a> of wall painting (80-20 BC) and are considered an adoption from Hellenistic art trends. While lead strips were used in Hellenistic mosaics of Delos, Athens, and Pella (Greece), <a href="Pergamon">Pergamon</a> (Turkey), <a href="Callatis">Callatis</a> (Romania), <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> (Egypt), and <a href="Chersonesus">Chersonesus</a> (<a href="Greeks%20in%20pre-Roman%20Crimea">the Crimean peninsula</a>), they are absent in Western Mediterranean mosaics of <a href="History%20of%20Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Sicily">Sicily</a>, and the <a href="Italian%20peninsula">Italian peninsula</a>. Westgate affirms that Hellenistic mosaics can be divided into two broad categories: eastern and western, based on their different styles and production techniques.

<a href="Red-figure%20pottery">Red-figure pottery</a> was no longer produced by the time the Delos mosaics were made. The black background technique of red-figure pottery was still appreciated in 4th-century-BC <a href="History%20of%20Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonian</a> pebble mosaics from Pella and in mosaics at Delos, such as the white-figured <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">tritoness</a> mosaic with tesserae. The black background technique was later used in <a href="glass%20art">glass art</a> such as <a href="cameo%20glass">cameo glass</a>, particularly <a href="Roman%20glass">Roman glass</a> (e.g. <a href="Portland%20Vase">Portland Vase</a>, <a href="Gemma%20Augustea">Gemma Augustea</a>, <a href="Great%20Cameo%20of%20France">Great Cameo of France</a>, etc.).

The undulating <a href="garland">garland</a> motif against a black background from the masonry-style <a href="mural">mural</a> paintings at Delos were earlier featured in Greek works ranging <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20vase%20painting">from vases</a> to 4th-century-BC <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">Macedonian</a> mosaics of Pella, particularly the <a href="Stag%20Hunt%20Mosaic">Stag Hunt Mosaic</a>. However, the painters of Delos arguably invented their own decorative genre using a combination of these older elements with new naturalistic coloring. Aside from the black background, mosaics like the Stag Hunt Mosaic were also inspired by the illusionist, three-dimensional qualities of Greek paintings. At Delos, paintings and mosaics inherited the same <a href="Classical%20Greek%20art">Classical Greek</a> standards of craftsmanship, lighting, shading, and coloring. Sculptors, painters, and mosaic artists may have all been part of the same system of <a href="patronage">patronage</a> at Delos, which in some instances would have necessitated the importation of foreign artists.

The northern quarter of Delos contains the Jewelry Quarter, where older structures such as workshops and other archaeological remains dating to the 3rd century BC and early 2nd century BC have been discovered. By the second half of the 2nd century BC these were replaced by private homes built in the most characteristic fashion for Delos: a narrow, rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, a "<a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">vestibule</a>" service room in the front, and a larger, main room in the rear. The quarter of the House of the Masks is the only area of Delos without this archetypal house plan. Some houses of the Northern Quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes, including <a href="Lycurgus%20of%20Thrace">Lycurgus of Thrace</a> and <a href="Ambrosia">Ambrosia</a> in an upper-story mosaic, as well as <a href="Athena">Athena</a> and <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> together with a seated woman in a main-room mosaic.

Most houses in the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as <a href="trapezoid">trapezoid</a>al designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular <a href="street%20grid">street grid</a> is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar to the majority of excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without <a href="portico">portico</a>es, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the houses in the Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.

The Delos mosaic of <a href="Dionysos">Dionysos</a> riding a tiger in the House of Dionysos is one of the finest examples of "opus vermiculatum", according to Dunbabin, and is comparable to the Dionysos riding a leopard from the House of the Masks if not the simpler from the Macedonian capital at Pella. A key thematic difference, however, are the wings of Dionysos that suggest his incarnation as a <a href="daimon">daimon</a> instead of a god. The tesserae materials, made of <a href="Hellenistic%20glass">glass</a>, <a href="faience">faience</a>, <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a> and natural stones, are fashioned into pieces measuring roughly one millimeter square, allowing for sharp detail and an elaborate color scheme.

The House of the Masks is named after the mosaic motif of <a href="Theatre%20of%20ancient%20Greece">theatre masks</a> decorating ivy scrolls arranged in strips around a central surface area decorated in a cubic pattern. The more intricately decorated mosaics are found in four different rooms branching off from the peristyle courtyard paved with marble chips, with corridor mosaics utilizing <a href="amphora">amphora</a> fragments. In the center of one mosaic is the figure of Dionysos riding a leopard against a similar black background to the mosaic in the House of Dionysos. Another central mosaic features a flute player and a dancing figure, the latter perhaps representing <a href="Silenus">Silenus</a>. Only the Dionysos figure employs the "vermiculatum" method. The other mosaics of the house fail to achieve the <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">naturalism</a> of finer figure scenes and motifs, but they nevertheless demonstrate an attempt at mimicking their <a href="illusionist">illusionist</a> qualities with the tesselated technique.

The House of the Dolphins contains a peristyle floor mosaic design that is unusual for Delos, with a circle enclosed by a square outline. In each corner of the square are pairs of dolphins ridden by tiny winged figures bearing the emblems of various <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20figures">Greek deities</a>, namely the <a href="thyrsus">thyrsus</a>, <a href="caduceus">caduceus</a>, <a href="trident">trident</a>, and one object that is missing due to damage. The circle contains a central rosette design surrounded by floral garlands and <a href="griffin">griffin</a>s. The mosaic, signed by a certain <a href="Asclepiades%20of%20Arados">Asclepiades</a> of <a href="Arados">Arados</a> (in ancient <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>, now western <a href="Syria">Syria</a>), is one of only two examples from Delos that bear a signature of the original artist.

Similar to the design of the majority of Delian homes, the House of the Lake is an irregular-shaped home (as opposed to a rectangular or square floor plan), located near a sacred lake and inhabited from roughly 300 to 100 BC. The peristyle "<a href="impluvium">impluvium</a>" is decorated with a geometric-patterned motif around a central rosette, surrounded on all sides by monolithic columns in the <a href="Ionic%20style">Ionic style</a>.

The House of the Trident contains peristyle panels with the motif of a black dolphin situated around a red anchor and black tridents against a white background. The theme suggests that the owners of the house were somehow connected to <a href="Ancient%20maritime%20history">maritime pursuits</a>. These simple, two-dimensional mosaics stand in contrast to the multicolored, finely detailed, three-dimensional Hellenistic mosaics of figures and motifs. They are perhaps comparable or even linked to the black-and-white pavement mosaics that appear in <a href="Roman%20Italy">Roman Italy</a> some decades later.
