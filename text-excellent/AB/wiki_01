John Edward Brownlee sex scandal

The John Brownlee sex scandal occurred in 1934 in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, Canada, and forced the resignation of <a href="Premier%20of%20Alberta">the provincial Premier</a>, <a href="John%20Edward%20Brownlee">John Edward Brownlee</a>. Brownlee was accused of seducing Vivian MacMillan, a family friend and a secretary for Brownlee's attorney-general in 1930, when she was 18 years old, and continuing the affair for three years. MacMillan claimed that the married premier had told her that she must have sex with him for his own sake and that of his invalid wife. She had, she testified, relented after physical and emotional pressure. Brownlee called her story a fabrication, and suggested that it was the result of a conspiracy by MacMillan, her would-be fiancé, and several of Brownlee's political opponents in the <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Alberta Liberal Party</a>.

MacMillan and her father sued Brownlee for <a href="seduction%20%28tort%29">seduction</a>. After a sensational trial in June 1934, the six-man jury found in favour of the plaintiffs, awarding them $10,000 and $5,000, respectively. In an unusual move, trial judge <a href="William%20Carlos%20Ives">William Ives</a> disregarded the jury's finding and dismissed the case. The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> eventually overturned the decision and awarded MacMillan $10,000 in damages. This award was affirmed by the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council</a>, Canada's highest court of appeal at the time. All of this was largely academic to Brownlee, who resigned after the jury's finding. During the next election, his <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> were wiped out of the legislature, losing every seat.

John Brownlee became Premier of Alberta in 1925 as the leader of the parliamentary caucus of the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> (UFA). Early in his premiership, he achieved a number of successes, including winning control of the province's natural resources from the federal government, but by 1933 the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> was taking its toll on his government's popularity. Political forces were advocating radical overhauls of the financial system. The <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> and elements of the UFA's <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> favored <a href="socialism">socialism</a> and government ownership of the means of production, while the <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Alberta Liberal Party</a>, many within the UFA, and <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>'s new provincial movement favored <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a>, although in differing forms and with differing levels of enthusiasm.

In 1934, Brownlee was embroiled in a sex scandal, with major consequences to his political career. Those involved with the scandal gave widely disparate accounts of the surrounding facts; on only a minority of details did the parties agree. In 1930, Brownlee visited <a href="Edson%2C%20Alberta">Edson</a> while campaigning in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201930">1930 provincial election</a>. While there, Allan MacMillan—the mayor of Edson and a political ally of Brownlee's—took him to a farmers' picnic. On the way to the event, Brownlee chatted with MacMillan's daughter, Vivian, then seventeen years old and unsure as to her future. The premier encouraged her to come to Edmonton and study business at <a href="Alberta%20College">Alberta College</a>. She did so and, after graduating in June 1931, started working in the office of the provincial <a href="Attorney-General%23Canada">Attorney-General</a> as a <a href="stenographer">stenographer</a> on July 3.

While in Edmonton, she became close to the Brownlee family. On July 5, 1933, while the rest of his family was vacationing at Sylvan Lake, Brownlee was taking MacMillan for a car ride when he noticed they were being followed. In the pursuing vehicle were John Caldwell, a suitor of MacMillan's and third-year medical student at the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a>, and Neil MacLean, a prominent Edmonton lawyer and <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal Party</a> supporter who had been opposing counsel in the acrimonious and high profile divorce proceeding of Brownlee's Minister of Public Works, <a href="Oran%20McPherson">Oran McPherson</a>. Brownlee made a series of sharp turns and reversals, in an effort to first ascertain whether he was indeed being followed and, once satisfied that he was, to evade the other car. Unable to do so, he dropped MacMillan off at her home and returned to his.

That August, Brownlee received a letter from MacLean reading in part "We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan." Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Banking%20and%20Currency">Royal Commission on Banking and Currency</a>, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded "what about you?" Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing "I am not asking you to refrain from your action, but I want to tell you that the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its money you are after, I haven't got it."

On September 22, MacLean filed a statement of claim before Judge <a href="John%20R.%20Boyle">John R. Boyle</a> on behalf of Allan and Vivian MacMillan. The claim was made under the Alberta Seduction Act, and sought damages of $10,000 for Vivian and $5,000 for Allan. It alleged that Brownlee, after arranging for Vivian's move from Edson to Edmonton, had seduced her in the fall of 1930 when she was eighteen, and had had regular sexual contact with her for a period of three years. Brownlee denied the allegations immediately (and made a rejected offer to resign from the Royal Commission) and on November 13 filed a counter-claim against Vivian MacMillan and John Caldwell, alleging that they had conspired to obtain money through false allegations.

According to Vivian MacMillan, when she met Brownlee in 1930 he told her that she would "grow up to be a beautiful woman", urged her to move to Edmonton, and offered to arrange a government job for her. He further offered to act as guardian to her and allow her to live in his house until she found a place of her own. On his advice and assurances, she moved to Edmonton and, after graduating from Alberta College, received the stenographer's position that she claimed had been arranged for her by the premier.

Immediately after her arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her—commenting that "a little birdie" had told him that she was in town—and invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there. She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew "about life". On her response that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. Instead, he drove her west of town on <a href="Alberta%20Highway%2016">Highway 16</a> and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, that he and his wife had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.

The next week on another ride home, a similar conversation ensued, this one culminating in Brownlee forcing a resisting MacMillan into the car's back seat where he partially penetrated her against her will. Two weeks later, she alleged, they had complete consensual intercourse. After, when she expressed concern about becoming pregnant, he told her that "he knew of some pills that he would give me and if I took them at the end of each month before I menstruated that they would be very safe and there would not be any danger of me becoming pregnant." MacMillan recounted that their relationship continued in this way, with sex occurring an average of three times per week. In September 1931, she stayed in the Brownlee house for three days while Mrs. Brownlee was in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>; she alleged that during that time, Brownlee had his son, who usually slept in Brownlee's room, transferred to a different room so that Brownlee and MacMillan could have sex.

Some of MacMillan's most sensational allegations concerned a six-week period in the spring of 1932 when she was filling in at the Brownlee household for an absent maid. She said that she slept in the maid's room, one of three bedrooms on the second floor of Brownlee's house; a second room was occupied by Brownlee and his son Jack, and the third by Florence Brownlee and her son Alan. During this six-week period, she claimed, she and Brownlee had had sex every night; Brownlee would signal her to leave her room by turning on the tap in the second floor bathroom, and then flush the toilet and walk in lockstep with her to mask the sound of her movement. Once in the premier's room, they would have sex next to his sleeping son, taking care to be quiet. She recounted how on one occasion Jack had seemed to stir, and Brownlee had turned on the light in the middle of intercourse to make sure that his son was all right.

MacMillan said that during the summer of 1932 she experienced a nervous breakdown (for which Florence Brownlee paid the hospital bills), and that she met and fell in love with Caldwell soon after. She resolved to end her affair with Brownlee but he reacted angrily, telling her that it would mean his wife's death and MacMillan's inability to find a job anywhere in Alberta. That evening, she confided the affair to her landlady. On October 31, 1932, she had dinner with Brownlee's sons and visited Brownlee, who was sick in bed. Despite her protestations that she was on her way to a <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> party with Caldwell, he insisted that they have sex, which they did. Thereafter, the affair resumed. On another occasion, he called her away from her visiting mother to have sex with him at the <a href="Alberta%20Legislature%20Building">legislature building</a>.

In late January 1933, Caldwell proposed to her. She broke down and told him of the affair. She described his reaction as sympathetic, though he rescinded the marriage proposal. In May, at Caldwell's urging, she consulted a lawyer, but continued the affair until July 5, the night of the fateful drive.

MacMillan testified that for the duration of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee "from terror and because he told me it was my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me which I could not break." She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.

Brownlee denied absolutely MacMillan's claims. He said that there had been no sexual activity between him and MacMillan, likening their relationship instead to that of an uncle and his favourite niece. To claims that he had induced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and arranged a position for her in the Attorney General's office, he asserted "in the thirteen years I have been in public life I have never promised any person in this Province a position." He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until <a href="Christopher%20Pattinson">Christopher Pattinson</a>, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for <a href="Edson%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Edson</a>, told him. He further claimed that his sex life with Mrs. Brownlee was what he would consider normal for a husband and wife (which was corroborated by his wife).

He acknowledged that he had been driving MacMillan around the evening of July 5, 1933, when he was followed by Caldwell and MacLean, but gave a dramatically different account of his reasons for doing so. According to him, there had been talk of MacMillan joining his family at their rental cottage at <a href="Sylvan%20Lake%2C%20Alberta">Sylvan Lake</a> that weekend provided that she could get the necessary time off work, and that evening he called her to see whether or not she had been able to. During the ensuing phone conversation, MacMillan told him that she had other problems bothering her, and asked if Brownlee would take her for a drive to discuss them. He agreed to do so, and it was during this drive that he noticed that he was being followed.

In support of this story, Brownlee pointed to investigational work by Harry Brace, a <a href="private%20detective">private detective</a> in the employ of Attorney General <a href="John%20Lymburn">John Lymburn</a>. According to Brace, Caldwell had told at least three witnesses that he expected to soon receive a large amount of money from someone "high up in political life". He also specifically told one of Brace's agents that he had deliberately set out to frame Brownlee, that in selecting Neil MacLean as his lawyer he had deliberately chosen a <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal</a> (the Liberals were considered the major opposition to Brownlee's government at the time), and that if the Liberals won the next election there would be "nothing I want I won't be able to get". Disappointingly for Brownlee, Brace did not uncover evidence that MacMillan was lying about the affair itself: Caldwell, based on his comments to Brace's men, seemed very much under the impression that the affair had occurred exactly as claimed. Moreover, Brace found that Carl Snell, MacMillan's one-time suitor, claimed to have been told in 1932 that MacMillan was having a consensual affair with the premier.

Brownlee's defenders called into doubt MacLean's motivation for involvement in the case: according to rumour, MacLean had been involved in a <a href="drunk%20driving">drunk driving</a> incident several years previous in which he had driven his car into a ditch. When another motorist had pulled him out, MacLean had attempted unsuccessfully to drive away with the chains still attached to his vehicle, for which he was charged. He had reputedly asked Brownlee, then the Attorney General, to have the charges dropped. Upon Brownlee's refusal, he had allegedly vowed to "get" him. Finally, Brownlee made a point of noting that, as a medical student, Caldwell would have been well-positioned to coach MacMillan on her claims about the pills she was taking to avoid pregnancy. According to Brownlee, the events alleged were a complete fabrication, the result of scheming by an opportunistic young medical student and his impressionable girlfriend, encouraged by a vindictive lawyer and unscrupulous political opponents.

The trial began in June 1934 before Justice <a href="William%20Carlos%20Ives">William Ives</a> with three days of testimony from MacMillan. Brownlee's lawyer, <a href="Arthur%20LeRoy%20Smith">Arthur LeRoy Smith</a>, used his <a href="cross%20examination">cross examination</a> to call into question almost everything MacMillan said. To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before she had even met Brownlee. He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard. Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until more than a year after that date. In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room. After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large <a href="deadbolt">deadbolt</a> on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, why had she not used it? "Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said," was the plaintiff's response. MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four. When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period.

Other witnesses for the plaintiffs included a former maid of Brownlee's, who testified that she had seen the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night. Allan MacMillan was also called: though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.

The defence called Brownlee, who recounted his version of events. He testified that he had been otherwise occupied on many of the days that he and MacMillan had supposedly had sex; in one case, he produced newspaper stories showing that he had been making a speech in <a href="Stettler%2C%20Alberta">Stettler</a> at a time that MacMillan had claimed he was forcing himself upon her in Edmonton. In another, he testified that he was meeting with O. H. Snow, the mayor of <a href="Raymond%2C%20Alberta">Raymond</a>. MacLean on cross-examination tried to paint Brownlee as a man of tremendous persuasive powers, recalling his time as a lawyer in <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, only to have Brownlee retort that he had only ever tried two cases, spending most of his time drafting commercial documents. MacLean also emphasized the $1,400 that Lymburn as Attorney General had spent investigating the case, suggesting that this amounted to government funds being spent to vindicate Brownlee personally; outside of the courtroom, Lymburn responded that his office had received a complaint that an "Edmonton lawyer"—taken by all involved to be MacLean—had approached a young woman offering money to place Brownlee in a compromising position, and that, as a criminal allegation, it had been the obligation of his office to investigate. He further emphasized that, against his protestations, Brownlee had insisted on reimbursing the government for the full cost of the investigation.

After the premier's testimony was completed, Smith called his wife, Florence Brownlee. She supported her husband's account of MacMillan's relationship with the Brownlee family and reported that, when the premier drove MacMillan home at night, he was very seldom late returning. On cross-examination, she denied that she would have defended her husband if she believed him to be guilty. Additional witnesses for the defence included Brownlee's personal secretary, Civil Service Commissioner Frederick Smailes, and four legislature janitors. Smailes acknowledged knowing at the time of MacMillan's hiring that she was acquainted with Brownlee, but denied involvement on Brownlee's part in the decision to hire her, while the janitors denied ever seeing a young woman enter the premier's office in the evenings. Jessie Ellergert, who had worked for the Brownlees as a maid, said that she had no reason to believe that there was a sexual relationship between the premier and MacMillan; moreover, she specifically recalled the Halloween night MacMillan had referred to in her testimony, and testified that the household was far too bustling for the alleged sex to have occurred.

The trial concluded with a field trip, as the jury went to view both Brownlee's house and two stretches of road where MacMillan had claimed key encounters took place. Rainy weather meant that on more than one occasion the jurors and lawyers had to push cars out of the mud. Though one road essentially matched MacMillan's description, it was located next to a populated settlement rather than deserted as she had claimed. The other, in contrast to her description of it as a side road, was a busy highway. Upon the jury's return, Smith surprised them by announcing that Brownlee's counter-claim was being dropped; he said that there was no need to complicate the clear cut issue of "seduction or no seduction" with evidence about a conspiracy on the part of MacMillan and Caldwell. Legal historian Patrick Brode criticized this decision, suggesting that the jury was expecting proof of a conspiracy and that, when this proof was not forthcoming, Brownlee's credibility was hurt.

Besides the factual issues that the jury was called on to adjudicate, there was a legal issue of what constituted "seduction" under the law. The basis of the claim was a two-hundred-year-old <a href="tort">tort</a> which allowed a man to sue anybody who impregnated his female servant. The basis for damages under such a claim was the servant's inability to perform her duties to the detriment of the employer. The tort was later broadened to allow the seductee's father to sue; only in statute in 1903 was the law amended to give standing to the woman herself. At issue was what damage, if any, she needed to show in order to have a cause of action. The defence argued that in all precedents there had been a pregnancy resulting, and that without one the plaintiffs could not claim damages. In response, MacLean emphasized the not entirely consensual nature of the alleged relationship. Brownlee himself responded that if the alleged relationship had been non-consensual, he should have been charged under the criminal law for rape, not sued for seduction; that the plaintiffs had not attempted to press criminal charges was evidence, he believed, of their bad faith and financial motivation.

After six days of testimony, closing arguments were given: Smith's lasted two hours and fifteen minutes and emphasized the discrepancies in MacMillan's story. MacLean's was a relatively brief forty minutes, in which he argued that the improbable and fantastic nature of his client's tale was evidence that she could not possibly have invented it. Ives then instructed the jurors, and defined "seduction" as "inducing a woman to part with her virtue ... [which] may be by any artful device that brings about her consent." After four hours and forty minutes the jury returned and announced its finding that Brownlee had seduced MacMillan in October 1930 when he had partially penetrated her, and that both she and her father had suffered damages in the amounts claimed. Ives immediately announced that he strongly disagreed with the jury's findings, and that "the evidence does not warrant them". On July 2, he issued his written ruling, overturning the jury's verdict and dismissing the action; his reason for doing so was what he viewed as the lack of damage being demonstrated by the plaintiffs. According to Ives, even if the facts had been exactly as MacMillan had described, as a matter of law the plaintiffs could not claim damages without a pregnancy or an illness.

The trial was covered in lurid detail, especially by the "<a href="Edmonton%20Bulletin">Edmonton Bulletin</a>", which called it "the greatest drama ever to be heard in an Alberta court". The "Bulletin" was a Liberal paper, and MacLean had given it an advance copy of his statement of claim, which allowed MacMillan's allegations to be published and disseminated before the statement of claim was filed. The "Bulletin" was emphatically sympathetic to MacMillan in its coverage, and printed her detailed testimony (which included the dates and times of specific encounters) almost verbatim. Under the headline "Vivian Testifies to Harrowing Ordeal", it praised the young plaintiff as "bearing up with wonderful fortitude" and facing the ordeal "with courageous mien". Brownlee, in contrast, was a "love-torn, sex crazed victim of passion and jealousy, forcing his will upon her in parked autos and on country highways". The jury was not sequestered and was free to read these accounts. Edmontonians were no less enthralled than their newspaper, and many showed up to the courthouse early on the days of trial, hoping to get a seat. Towards the end of the trial, Ives revoked the "Bulletin"'s press privileges at the trial and fined its publisher $300 and a reporter $100 for publishing writing "likely to inflame public opinion and interfere with the even-handed course of justice."

Media attention on the trial spread beyond the provincial and national borders: <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a> published at least two articles on the trial in the United States, and the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" and "Paris Midi" covered it from across the <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>.

Reaction to the trial's outcome was mixed. The "Bulletin" was outraged, as was the Canadian Civil Liberties Protective Association, which called Ives' decision to overturn the jury's finding one that "set the clock back 300 years". Both organized subscriptions to finance an expected appeal. The "<a href="Winnipeg%20Free%20Press">Winnipeg Free Press</a>" called for an investigation of Ives for apparent favouritism towards Brownlee. The "<a href="Vancouver%20Sun">Vancouver Sun</a>", on the other hand, sympathized with the premier, arguing that his "personal difficulties should not have been aired publicly". Brownlee's political allies, including <a href="Irene%20Parlby">Irene Parlby</a> and <a href="Henry%20Wise%20Wood">Henry Wise Wood</a>, remained loyal, with Wood keeping a large picture of Brownlee on the wall of his guest bedroom.

The plaintiffs appealed and the case went before the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20Alberta">Alberta Supreme Court appeals division</a> in January 1935. On February 2, by a 3–2 decision, the court upheld Ives' ruling. The majority ruling by Chief Justice <a href="Horace%20Harvey">Horace Harvey</a> cast serious doubts on MacMillan's credibility, calling her story "quite unsupported by other evidence" and noting that she "showed a readiness to admit that she may have been mistaken as regards very positive statements previously made when by the questions it appeared there may be independent evidence she was wrong". In addition to agreeing with Ives on the points of law, he felt that the jury had not based its finding of fact on the evidence in the case. Justices <a href="Charles%20Richmond%20Mitchell">Mitchell</a> and Ford concurred. Justice <a href="Alfred%20Henry%20Clarke">Clarke</a>, in dissent, agreed that MacMillan's story was unlikely, but expressed a willingness to defer to the jury on questions of fact. On the legal questions, he cited a precedent written by Justice Harvey himself in which the chief justice had argued that the inclusion of seduced women as potential plaintiffs under the "Seduction Act" proved that its framers intended a broader definition of damage than financial damage. Justice Lunney concurred. The court was unanimous in upholding Ives' dismissal of Allan MacMillan's action, and he did not appeal further.

Not satisfied with the verdict, the "Bulletin" again organized a campaign to fund an appeal, which was submitted to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>; on March 1, 1937, Ives' decision was overturned. Chief Justice <a href="Lyman%20Duff">Lyman Duff</a>, writing for the majority, accepted the jury's finding of fact and, echoing Justice Clarke, concluded that the framers of the Alberta Seduction Act had not intended that damage to a seductee be required to be the same as those to her father or employer (i.e. financial) in order to be actionable. The court ordered Brownlee to pay $10,000 in damages to MacMillan, plus trial costs. <a href="Henry%20Hague%20Davis">Henry Hague Davis</a> in dissent focussed less on the questions of law and more on the evidence in the case, and argued that the jury's finding of fact was perverse and that the appeal should be dismissed.

After the Supreme Court ruling, Brownlee settled with MacMillan, but still desired to clear his name. On July 1, 1937, the federal government by <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a> gave him leave to appeal to the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council</a>, at the time Canada's highest court of appeal. On March 11 and 12, 1940, the committee heard Brownlee's appeal. It was denied, as the committee endorsed the Supreme Court of Canada's focus on <a href="statutory%20interpretation">statutory interpretation</a>.

For John Brownlee's political career, Ives' ruling and the subsequent appeals were irrelevant: once the jury's finding came down, he immediately announced that he would resign as soon as a replacement could be found. On July 10, 1934, he was succeeded as Premier by <a href="Richard%20Gavin%20Reid">Richard Gavin Reid</a>, his government's Treasurer and Minister of Health and Municipal Affairs. Brownlee stayed on as MLA and sought to retain his <a href="Ponoka%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Ponoka</a> seat in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 provincial election</a>, but was trounced by <a href="Edith%20Rogers%20%28Alberta%20politician%29">Edith Rogers</a> of <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>'s <a href="Alberta%20Social%20Credit%20League">Alberta Social Credit League</a>. Not a single UFA member won re-election as Aberhart's movement and its promises of innovative solutions to the western world's economic problems rode to a decisive victory. In evaluating Social Credit's victory, historians unanimously cite the province's dire economic straits as the main factor, though <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a> historian David Elliott has acknowledged that "Aberhart and his cause were also helped" by the seduction scandal. This view has been endorsed by <a href="University%20of%20Western%20Ontario">University of Western Ontario</a> sociologist Edward Bell. John Barr, in his history of the Alberta Social Credit Party, is more dismissive, calling it "unlikely" that the scandal was a major factor in the UFA's defeat.

Brode acknowledges that the question of whether Brownlee seduced MacMillan "defies any definitive answer" but says that the evidence presented in the trial did not justify a finding that he did, and speculates that if MacMillan had brought her suit in a later generation she would have been "laughed out of court". <a href="Lakeland%20College%20%28Alberta%29">Lakeland College</a> historian and Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster does not take a position on whether or not Brownlee was guilty of seduction, but hints that a likely truth might lie "between the two extremes" of the parties' claims: that Brownlee and MacMillan did have a consensual affair which was then highjacked and exploited by the premier's more opportunistic and vengeful opponents. He leaves little doubt that he considers the behaviour of the "Edmonton Bulletin" and of the Liberal Party, especially its leader, <a href="William%20R.%20Howson">William R. Howson</a>, to have been profoundly unethical. <a href="Athabasca%20University">Athabasca University</a> historian Alvin Finkel has criticized Foster for being too friendly towards Brownlee, saying that he does not consider the scandal sufficiently from MacMillan's perspective.

A play at the 2008 <a href="Edmonton%20International%20Fringe%20Festival">Edmonton International Fringe Festival</a>, "Respecting the Action for Seduction: The Brownlee Affair", was based on the scandal, and received average to above average reviews.

After leaving office, John Brownlee returned to the practice of law. He died in 1961. Vivian MacMillan stayed out of the limelight. She did not marry Caldwell, and returned to Edson, where on August 7, 1935, she wed confectioner Henry Sorenson. Following her husband's death, she became the bookkeeper for a <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> construction company. After an affair, she married her boss, Frank Howie, in 1955. Vivian Howie died in 1980.

Melbourne Castle

Melbourne Castle was a <a href="medieval%20architecture">medieval</a> castle in <a href="Melbourne%2C%20Derbyshire">Melbourne, Derbyshire</a>. It was built on the site of an earlier royal <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> that had provided accommodation for noblemen hunting in a nearby royal park in the reign of <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a>. Construction of the castle was started in 1311 by <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster</a>, and continued until 1322, shortly before his execution, but the work was never fully completed.

From the early 14th century, Melbourne Castle was mainly in the possession of the <a href="Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Earls</a> and <a href="Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Dukes of Lancaster</a> or <a href="The%20Crown">the crown</a>. Improvements and repairs were made, particularly by <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt</a>, and the building was in generally good condition throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. <a href="John%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bourbon">John I, Duke of Bourbon</a>, was kept at Melbourne for 19 years after his capture at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a> in 1415, and the castle was considered as a possible prison for <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, although events led to her incarceration elsewhere.

The castle was in decline by the end of the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>. Although the stonework was sound, minimal maintenance had led to significant deterioration of other parts of the structure. The manor was purchased in 1604 by <a href="Henry%20Hastings%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon</a>, who had <a href="Ashby-de-la-Zouch%20Castle">his own castle</a> in nearby <a href="Ashby-de-la-Zouch">Ashby-de-la-Zouch</a>. The Melbourne property was then demolished and used as a source for building materials. All that remains of Melbourne Castle today is a section of wall about 15 m (50 ft) long and 4 m (13 ft) high and some foundations; nothing is known of the internal layout of the former building. The <a href="ruins">ruins</a> are <a href="Listed%20building%23England%20and%20Wales">grade II listed</a> and the site is a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a>. There is no public access to the castle remains.

<a href="Melbourne%2C%20Derbyshire">Melbourne</a> is a town in <a href="South%20Derbyshire">South Derbyshire</a> close to the <a href="River%20Trent">River Trent</a>, which may have originated as buildings associated with the royal manor to the south of the nearby settlement at <a href="Kings%20Newton">Kings Newton</a>. Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier manor house of unknown date; there is an old tradition that the manor was originally established in about the year 900, during the reign of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>, but there is no evidence for this. As recorded in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>, the manor of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> prior to the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>. The property then passed into the hands of <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William I of England</a>. After creating the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Carlisle">Diocese of Carlisle</a> in 1133, <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a> gave the manor for life to <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20%28bishop%20of%20Carlisle%29">Æthelwold</a>, the first <a href="Bishop%20of%20Carlisle">bishop</a>. Some time later, the diocese built a palace nearby on the site of what is now <a href="Melbourne%20Hall">Melbourne Hall</a>. When Bishop Æthelwold died in about 1156, the manor reverted to the crown.

A <a href="medieval%20deer%20park">royal hunting park</a> close to Melbourne was probably created by <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a> around 1200, and the King is known to have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> to Bishop <a href="Walter%20Mauclerk">Walter Mauclerk</a> of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, <a href="Edmund%20Crouchback">Edmund Crouchback</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Lancaster">1st Earl of Lancaster</a>, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster</a>, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.

The castle was built to the east of the 14th-century town on a slightly raised location. The area enclosed within the castle's outer walls was about 2.8 ha (7 acres), but with outbuildings, other ancillary constructions and orchards, the total area has been estimated to be at least 8 ha (20 acres). The walls were constructed with rubble faced with <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a>, and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3 m (10 ft) thick.

All that is known of the appearance of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. <a href="Tutbury%20Castle">Tutbury</a> and <a href="Pontefract%20Castle">Pontefract Castle</a>s both have similar <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a>s and <a href="chapel">chapel</a>s, and Tutbury's <a href="motte-and-bailey%20castle">motte</a> and Pontefract's <a href="curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain wall</a> are also close in style to those in the illustrations. <a href="Sandal%20Castle">Sandal Castle</a> has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.

A bakehouse, kitchen and chapel are recorded, as well as the <a href="great%20hall">hall</a>, <a href="great%20chamber">great chamber</a>, and <a href="drawbridge">drawbridge</a>, but the details of the internal layout for the castle are unknown.

Earl Thomas granted the manor to his steward, <a href="Robert%20de%20Holland%2C%201st%20Baron%20Holand">Robert de Holland</a>, in February 1308. In 1311, Robert obtained a <a href="licence%20to%20crenellate">licence to crenellate</a> from <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward II</a> in order to <a href="medieval%20fortification">fortify</a> the manor house, and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322. Local tradition says that the stone was obtained from a quarry on the site of what is now Melbourne Pool. The records show £1,313 was spent on the project in the year 1313–14, of which £548 was paid to masons for dressing stone. Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at <a href="Ravenstone%2C%20Leicestershire">Ravenstone</a> in 1315. The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a>, <a href="Millstone%20Grit">Millstone Grit</a>. This is a coarsely grained <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> which can be worked to produce good-quality <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a>. The village was centred around the church, castle and <a href="High%20Street">High Street</a> until the late 18th century.

Earl Thomas, with other barons, captured King Edward's favourite, <a href="Piers%20Gaveston%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Piers Gaveston</a>, and killed him in 1312. Nevertheless, the King stayed at Melbourne in 1314. For a time, after Edward's defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Bannockburn">Bannockburn</a>, the earl, a friend of the Scots, controlled most of England, but by 1321 Edward had raised an army and driven Thomas from <a href="the%20Midlands">the Midlands</a>. The Lancastrian castles at Melbourne and <a href="Tutbury%20Castle">Tutbury</a> were left deserted and looted by the local populace. Earl Thomas was finally defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Boroughbridge">Battle of Boroughbridge</a> in 1322. He was swiftly executed, and Robert de Holland was beheaded in 1328. The King sent a garrison to Melbourne and appointed a steward, Ralph Basset, to replace the incumbent, John de Hardedeshull. In March, those who had stolen from the castle were arrested, and by April Edward had withdrawn his troops. He appointed Robert Tocher and <a href="Roger%20de%20Beler">Roger de Beler</a> in 1323 to help administer his possessions in Melbourne using money obtained from confiscations of rebel property in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>. Edward stayed at Melbourne again in 1325, and while there he issued a right to collect tolls to the men of nearby <a href="Swarkestone">Swarkestone</a> to repair the <a href="Swarkestone%20Bridge">bridge</a> over the Trent.

The castle, still unfinished at the time of Thomas' execution, along with its lands, remained as crown property until it was bestowed on <a href="Henry%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster</a>, Earl Thomas' brother, in 1327. In turn it passed to Henry's son, the fourth earl, who became the <a href="Henry%20of%20Grosmont%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">first Duke of Lancaster</a>. At the time of the duke's death in 1361, his <a href="Constable%23United%20Kingdom">constable</a> was Ingram Fauconer, who received an annual life stipend of £10, a further £5 going to his wife. Henry's heiress was <a href="Blanche%20of%20Lancaster">Blanche</a>, wife of <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt</a>. Duke John confirmed Fauconer's pension when he came into possession of the Lancastrian lands. <a href="Catherine%20of%20Lancaster">Catalina</a>, the three-year-old daughter of John by his second wife <a href="Constance%20of%20Castile%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Lancaster">Constance of Castile</a>, was given her own room and a <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Castilian</a> attendant at the castle in 1375.

Peter Melbourne was made keeper of the Melbourne estate in 1377 with an annual income of £10. He was granted another 66<a href="shilling">s</a> 8<a href="penny">d</a> in 1386, and 10 <a href="Mark%20%28money%29%23England%20and%20Scotland">marks</a> (£6 13s 4d) in 1395. The last award was conditional on his not meddling with the offices of constable and keeper of the parks, which had passed on to his son, also called Peter. The younger Peter Melbourne was involved in the upbringing of the future <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV</a> during the reign of <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II</a>. He was again appointed constable and steward of the Derbyshire manor in March 1399, although he gave up his office in April in return for an annuity from King Richard, who had confiscated the Lancastrian estates when John of Gaunt died earlier that year. Upon Henry's seizure of the throne, Peter was confirmed as constable, and in October 1399 his annuity was increased from £10 to 100 marks (£66 8s); in the following year he was awarded land in Derbyshire confiscated from <a href="Thomas%20Merke">Thomas Merke</a>, Bishop of Carlisle, co-leader of plot against the King.

The <a href="Duchy%20of%20Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a> continued to improve and expand the property through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. John of Gaunt had windows glazed in the Communal Hall and the Great Chamber in 1392/3, along with other works. He repaired a drawbridge in 1393/4 and made plumbing improvements in 1399/1400, using lead acquired as a <a href="asset%20forfeiture">forfeit</a> two years earlier.

For 19 years, the castle served as a prison for <a href="John%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bourbon">John I, Duke of Bourbon</a> after he was taken at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a> in 1415. His custodian was a Nicholas Montgomery the Younger. Nineteenth-century local historian <a href="John%20Joseph%20Briggs">John Joseph Briggs</a> claimed that during the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, the castle was partially dismantled by the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancastrian</a> forces of <a href="Margaret%20of%20Anjou">Margaret of Anjou</a>, but since her campaign was along the line of the <a href="Great%20North%20Road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Great North Road</a>, it was <a href="Melbourn">Melbourn</a>, <a href="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a> she sacked, not its Derbyshire namesake.

In 1545, <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a> <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a> reported to <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> the property was in good enough shape that it was described as "praty and yn meately good reparation" perhaps following repairs in the reign of <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a>, when Sir Ralph Shirley, a commander at Agincourt, was governor of the castle.

When <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> became queen, she ordered a survey of her castles. A 1562 report told her that only ten castles in the north of her realm were worth keeping; Melbourne was not one of these. A further survey in 1576 reported that, although the stonework was in good condition apart from one chimney and window, the timbers were perished, the lead roof was full of holes, one kitchen was on the verge of collapse, and another needed its floor replacing. In the same year, <a href="George%20Talbot%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury</a>, wrote to the queen to assure her that the castle was in good condition, worth £1,000, and could be repaired for £100. Since he was responsible for keeping the imprisoned <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, and her 140 retainers, he hoped to get her moved to Melbourne. In 1583, the castle was inspected again to see if it was suitable to house the captive queen. Although the rooms were sufficient in number and quality, the unfinished building was deemed "imperfect at every corner". The large rooms would need subdividing, the floors were earth and plaster, and there was no paved courtyard "so as being out of dors you are in the myre, for it is verie foule and unpleasaunt to walk round about the said house". In 1584, Queen Elizabeth finally decided to move Mary to Melbourne, only for the plan to be abandoned following the <a href="Babington%20Plot">Babington Plot</a> to assassinate the English queen and place her Scottish cousin on the throne.

In 1597, the castle was being used as a cattle pound, although a survey in 1602 assured Elizabeth that it was a "faire and anciente castle, which her Majesty keepeth in her own hands." The constable's annual fee of £10 was the same as that paid to Ingram Fauconer 140 years earlier.

The castle and lands were bought for £4,700 in 1604, by <a href="Henry%20Hastings%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon</a>, whose family seat at <a href="Ashby%20de%20la%20Zouch%20Castle">Ashby de la Zouch Castle</a> was just 11 km (7 mi) away. Melbourne Castle was destroyed between 1610 and 1637 so that its materials could be used in other construction. By 1629, it is likely that all the worked stone above ground level had been removed; Sir <a href="John%20Coke">John Coke</a> of Melbourne Hall obtained permission from the Bishop of Carlisle in that year to quarry stone from the castle foundations. Some of the facing stones were used to repair the <a href="weir">weir</a> at <a href="King%27s%20Mill%2C%20Castle%20Donington">King's Mill</a>, seen by some at the time to fulfil the words of a local prophet that "the waters of the Trent should overflow the towers of Melbourne castle". The Hastings estate was gradually sold off, and the castle site was sold by <a href="Francis%20Rawdon-Hastings%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Hastings">Earl Moira</a> in 1811.

A section of rubble wall about 15 m (50 ft) long and 4 m (13 ft) high remains, incorporated into an outbuilding of the adjacent farm on its north side. The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly <a href="Listed%20building%23England%20and%20Wales">grade II listed</a> and the castle remains are designated as a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a>. The area to the south of the wall has been excavated to reveal the ashlar bases of two polygonal towers. The site is on the east side of Castle Street in a private garden to which there is no public access.

Some of the stone taken from the castle was used to construct the mid-18th-century grade II-listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street, and other buildings known to have used the stone, but no longer extant, include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory. The mill, now demolished, was said to have been built on castle foundations up to 4 m (12 ft) thick; 15 Castle Street also rests on the old foundation wall. It is likely that the former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material.

An early 19th-century excavation found underground apartments "of considerable extent and superior workmanship", and excavations in the latter part of the same century found considerable foundations in the gardens of Castle Farm. Castle Mills housing estate contains a now-covered well 2 m (6 ft) in width and 15 m (50 ft) deep, and work in 1961 uncovered massive 5 m (16 ft) foundations east of the old mill and on the same alignment as the existing wall. Excavations in 1969–1971 found an extensive network of walls faced with ashlar, a door post, the base of a <a href="Stairs%23Spiral%20and%20helical%20stairs">spiral staircase</a> and evidence of an outer courtyard. Many stones had <a href="mason%27s%20mark">mason's mark</a>s. During construction works in 1988, masonry including the rubble centres of two large east–west walls was found in test trenches. Apart from the area of the turret bases next to the standing wall, none of the <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a> is now visible.

Gateway Protection Programme

The Gateway Protection Programme is a scheme operated by the British government in partnership with the <a href="United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) and co-funded by the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU), offering a legal route for a quota of UNHCR-identified <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s to be <a href="third%20country%20resettlement">resettled</a> in the United Kingdom. Following a proposal by the British Home Secretary, <a href="David%20Blunkett">David Blunkett</a>, in October 2001, the legal basis was established by the <a href="Nationality%2C%20Immigration%20and%20Asylum%20Act%202002">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> and the programme itself launched in March 2004. Since its inception, the programme has enjoyed broad support from the UK's main political parties.

The Gateway Protection Programme initially had a quota of 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, but the actual number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. <a href="Demographics%20of%20Liberia">Liberian</a>, <a href="Demographics%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Congolese</a>, <a href="Demographics%20of%20Sudan">Sudanese</a>, <a href="Demographics%20of%20Myanmar">Burmese</a>, <a href="People%20of%20Ethiopia">Ethiopian</a>, <a href="Demographics%20of%20Mauritania">Mauritanian</a>, <a href="Refugees%20of%20Iraq">Iraqi</a>, <a href="Bhutanese%20refugees">Bhutanese</a>, <a href="Eritrean%20people">Eritrean</a>, <a href="Palestinians">Palestinian</a> and <a href="Somalis">Somali</a> refugees are amongst those who have been resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 <a href="local%20authorities">local authorities</a> participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the <a href="North%20West%20England">North West region of England</a> and three in <a href="Yorkshire%20and%20Humberside">Yorkshire and Humberside</a>. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.

The programme is the UK's "quota refugee" <a href="third%20country%20resettlement">resettlement scheme</a>. Refugees designated as particularly vulnerable by the UNHCR are assessed by the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> for eligibility under the <a href="Convention%20Relating%20to%20the%20Status%20of%20Refugees">1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a>. If they meet the eligibility criteria they are then brought to the UK and granted <a href="indefinite%20leave%20to%20remain">indefinite leave to remain</a>. The <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Migration">International Organization for Migration</a> (IOM) helps facilitate pre-departure <a href="Screening%20%28medicine%29">medical screening</a>, <a href="counselling">counselling</a>, dossier preparation, <a href="transport">transport</a> and immediate arrival assistance. Once in the UK, refugees are entered into a 12-month support programme intended to aid their <a href="Social%20integration">integration</a>. The programme has involved <a href="local%20authorities">local authorities</a> and <a href="NGO">NGO</a>s including the <a href="British%20Red%20Cross">British Red Cross</a>, the <a href="International%20Rescue%20Committee">International Rescue Committee</a>, <a href="Migrant%20Helpline">Migrant Helpline</a>, <a href="Refugee%20Action">Refugee Action</a>, the <a href="Refugee%20Arrivals%20Project">Refugee Arrivals Project</a>, the <a href="Refugee%20Council">Refugee Council</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Refugee%20Council">Scottish Refugee Council</a> and <a href="Refugee%20Support">Refugee Support</a>. These organisations formed the Resettlement Inter-Agency Partnership at the planning stage of the programme, in order to pool their resources and form a partnership for the delivery of services to the resettled refugees.

The programme is distinct from and in addition to ordinary provisions for claiming <a href="Right%20of%20asylum">asylum</a> in the United Kingdom. Since 2008, it has been co-funded by the European Union, first through the <a href="European%20Refugee%20Fund">European Refugee Fund</a> and then through its successor, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). Over the period 2009–14, the Home Office provided £29.97 million in funding and the EU £18.67 million. Anna Musgrave of the Refugee Council argues that the programme "is rarely talked about and the Home Office, in the main, stay fairly quiet about it."

The Gateway Protection Programme is not the first British refugee resettlement programme. Other, informal resettlement programmes include the <a href="Mandate%20Refugee%20Scheme">Mandate Refugee Scheme</a>, and the UK has also participated in the <a href="Ten%20or%20More%20Plan">Ten or More Plan</a>. The former is for so-called "mandate" refugees who have been granted refugee status by UNHCR in third countries. To qualify for the scheme, refugees must have close ties to the UK and it must also be demonstrated that the UK is the most appropriate country for their resettlement. The Ten or More Plan, established by UNHCR in 1973 and administered in the UK by the British Red Cross, is for refugees requiring medical attention not available in their current location. During the 1990s, 2,620 refugees were settled in the UK through these two programmes. In 2003, the UK's Ten or More Plan had a resettlement goal of 10 people and the Mandate Refugee Scheme 300. Refugees have also been resettled through specific programmes following emergencies. For example, 42,000 <a href="Expulsion%20of%20Asians%20from%20Uganda">Ugandan Asians</a> expelled from <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a> during 1972–74, 22,500 <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a> during 1979–92, over 2,500 <a href="Bosnians">Bosnians</a> in the 1990s, and over 4,000 <a href="Kosovo">Kosovars</a> in 1999.

A new resettlement programme was proposed by the British <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="David%20Blunkett">David Blunkett</a> in October 2001, having been hinted at by the previous Home Secretary, <a href="Jack%20Straw">Jack Straw</a>, in a speech to the European Conference on Asylum in Lisbon in June 2000. The legal basis for the programme's funding was established by Section 59 of the <a href="Nationality%2C%20Immigration%20and%20Asylum%20Act%202002">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a>. This act was passed by the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> by 362 votes to 74 in June 2002 and by the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> – at the ninth attempt, following concern about the introduction of measures allowing for the <a href="Immigration%20detention">detention</a> of asylum seekers in rural areas) – in November 2002.

The Gateway Protection Programme was subsequently established in March 2004, with the first refugees arriving in the UK on 19 March. Initially, the programme quota was set at 500 per year. The British government has faced criticism from <a href="Academia">academics</a> and practitioners over the small number of refugees it has resettled in comparison with other developed states. For example, in 2001 the countries with the largest quota schemes were the United States (80,000 refugees), Canada (11,000) and Australia (10,000). Initially, David Blunkett had intended to raise the quota to 1,000 in the second year of the programme's operation, but <a href="Local%20government%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">local councils'</a> reluctance to participate in the scheme meant that it was slow to take off. It has been argued that their reluctance showed that hostile attitudes towards asylum seekers had carried over to affect the most genuinely needy refugees. The quota remained at 500 per year until the 2008/09 financial year, when it was increased to 750 refugees per year. The number of refugees resettled under the scheme is small in comparison to the number of asylum seekers offered protection in the UK. For example, in 2013, 17,647 initial decisions on asylum claims were made by the Home Office, of which 5,734 (32.5 per cent) determined the applicant to be a refugee and granted them asylum, 53 (0.3 per cent) granted humanitarian protection and 540 (3.1 per cent) granted discretionary leave. 11,105 applications (62.9 per cent) were refused. Worldwide, there were 51.2 million forcibly displaced people at the end of 2013, 16.7 million of whom were refugees.

The programme has been supported by the main British political parties at the national level since its inception, and there has also been support from councillors from each of the main parties at the <a href="Local%20government">local authority</a> level. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the scheme in 2014, refugee groups and others praised it as a successful programme and called for it to be expanded, particularly in light of the <a href="Refugees%20of%20the%20Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian refugee crisis</a>. In early 2014, <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> and the Refugee Council campaigned for the government to offer resettlement or humanitarian protection to Syrian refugees above and beyond the Gateway quota of 750 per year, "to ensure that resettlement opportunities continue to be available to refugees from the rest of the world". The anniversary of the programme was also the occasion of further criticism of the 750 quota, with some commentators arguing that this is mean-spirited and continues to compare unfavourably with the refugee resettlement programmes of states including the United States, Canada and Australia. Others, such as academic Jonathan Darling, have been more skeptical about expanding the scheme, for fear that any such move will be accompanied by greater restrictions on the ability of people to claim asylum in the UK. He argues that "we must be critical of any attempts to expand such a quota-based scheme at the expense of a more progressive asylum system". Furthermore, he argues that the "hospitality" of the scheme is highly conditional and can be viewed as a form of "compassionate repression", with the UNHCR, the Home Office and local authorities all involved in "sorting, decision, and consideration over which individuals are the 'exceptional cases'", to the exclusion of others.

In September 2015, in the context of the <a href="European%20migrant%20crisis">European migrant crisis</a>, Labour Party leadership candidate <a href="Yvette%20Cooper">Yvette Cooper</a> called for an increase in the number of refugees resettled in the UK to 10,000. The prime minister, <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>, subsequently announced that the UK would resettle 20,000 refugees from camps in countries bordering Syria over the period to 2020 under the <a href="Vulnerable%20Persons%20Relocation%20Scheme">Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme</a>, which was established in early 2014 and is distinct from, but modelled on, the Gateway Protection Programme.

The number of refugees resettled under the programme has been below the quota in every year except for 2009, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017. Refugees resettled have included <a href="Demographics%20of%20Liberia">Liberians</a> from <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a> and <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, <a href="Demographics%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Congolese (DRC)</a> from Uganda and <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, <a href="Demographics%20of%20Sudan">Sudanese</a> from Uganda, <a href="Demographics%20of%20Burma">Burmese</a> (including <a href="Karen%20people">Karen</a>, <a href="Mon%20people">Mon</a>, <a href="Pa%27O%20people">Pa'O</a> and <a href="Rohingya%20people">Rohingya</a> people) from <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="People%20of%20Ethiopia">Ethiopians</a> from <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, and <a href="Demographics%20of%20Mauritania">Mauritanians</a> from <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. Provision was made for 1,000 <a href="Iraqi%20refugees">Iraqi refugees</a> to be resettled in the UK between 1 April 2008 and the end of March 2010. In 2008, 236 Iraqis were resettled and as of 18 May, a further 212 had been resettled in 2009. However, in May 2009 the programme was shut down for those Iraqis resettling due to having worked in support of <a href="Operation%20Telic">British occupying forces</a> and therefore at risk for reprisals. This decision was criticised as premature and "mean-spirited" by some members of Parliament. Nonetheless, other Iraqis continue to be resettled under the Gateway Protection Programme and between 2004 and 2017, a total of 1,640 Iraqis were resettled as part of the programme. Other nationalities of refugees resettled under the scheme include <a href="Bhutanese%20people">Bhutanese</a>, <a href="Eritrean%20people">Eritreans</a>, <a href="Palestinians">Palestinians</a>, <a href="Demographics%20of%20Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leoneans</a> and <a href="Somalis">Somalis</a>.

In March 2009, out of the 434 local authorities in the UK, 15 were participating in the programme. By 2012, a total of 18 local authorities had participated. In a review of the scheme, academics Duncan Sim and Kait Laughlin note that "it is clear that, as with asylum seekers dispersed by the UK Borders Agency under Home Office dispersal policy, most refugees have been resettled away from London and south east England, a policy which may lead to separation of extended families". Of the 18 local authorities, eight are in <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a> and three in <a href="Yorkshire%20and%20Humberside">Yorkshire and Humberside</a>.

The first refugees resettled under the programme were housed in <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, which was the first city to join the scheme and which had branded itself the UK's first 'City of Sanctuary'. Others have been housed in cities and towns including <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, <a href="Brighton%20and%20Hove">Brighton and Hove</a>, <a href="Bromley">Bromley</a>, <a href="Colchester">Colchester</a>, <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, <a href="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>, <a href="Motherwell">Motherwell</a>, <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, and the <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Manchester area</a> including <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a>, <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a>, <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a>, <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford</a>, <a href="Stockport">Stockport</a> and <a href="Tameside">Tameside</a>. Sheffield, Bolton and Hull have received the largest numbers, accounting for just under half of all refugees resettled under the programme between 2004 and 2012. The large proportion of refugees who have been resettled in North West England has been attributed partly to strong leadership on migration issues in Greater Manchester.

In 2007, <a href="North%20Lanarkshire%20Council">North Lanarkshire Council</a> won the "Creating Integrated Communities" category in the UK Housing Awards for its involvement in the Gateway Protection Programme. Research with Congolese refugees settled with North Lanarkshire Council in Motherwell has found that the majority want to stay in the town and that they view it positively both as a location in its own right, and in comparison with other resettlement locations.

In April 2007, <a href="Bolton%20Museum">Bolton Museum</a> held an exhibition of photos of <a href="Sudanese%20refugees">Sudanese refugees</a> resettled in the town under the programme. A film, titled "Moving to Mars" was made about two ethnic Karen families resettled from Burma to Sheffield under the Gateway Protection Programme. The film opened the <a href="Sheffield%20Doc/Fest">Sheffield International Documentary Festival</a> in November 2009 and was aired on the television channel <a href="More4">More4</a> on 2 February 2010. One ethnic Karen refugee resettled with his family in Sheffield in 2006, <a href="Kler%20Heh">Kler Heh</a>, signed a professional contract to play football for <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United F.C.</a> in March 2015.

On 17 July 2009, three Congolese men resettled in Norwich under the programme were killed in a car crash on the <a href="A1%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">A1 road</a>. The Home Office released a promotional video in October 2009 that highlighted the success of the programme in resettling the first 15 Congolese families in Norwich in 2006. In 2011, the Home Office stopped using Norwich as a resettlement location in favour of locations in Yorkshire and Lancashire, reportedly to the disappointment of the local council.

Resettlement has been presented as a means of the UK fulfilling its obligations towards displaced people in the context of hostile public attitudes towards asylum seekers. Research has shown that members of the British public are generally well disposed to providing protection to genuine refugees, but are sceptical about the validity of asylum seekers' claims. A report published in 2005 states that "some participating agencies have been reluctant to pursue a proactive media strategy due to local political considerations and issues relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers". However, in February 2006, the <a href="Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Home%20Department">Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department</a> <a href="Andy%20Burnham">Andy Burnham</a>, when asked about how the programme fitted in with <a href="community%20cohesion">community cohesion</a> strategies, stated in the House of Commons that:
"The early evidence from areas in which authorities have participated in the programme shows that it has been successful in challenging some of the attacks on the notion of political asylum that we have heard in recent years. In Bolton and Sheffield in particular, the towns have rallied around the individuals who have come to them. The programme has been a positive experience for the receiving community and, of course, for the vulnerable individuals who have benefited from the protection that those towns have offered".
A report into the experience of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the <a href="University%20of%20Sussex">University of Sussex</a> in December 2007. The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and <a href="English%20language">English language</a> skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.

In February 2009, the Home Office published a report evaluating the effectiveness of the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through <a href="community%20group">community group</a>s and <a href="Place%20of%20worship">places of worship</a>. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream <a href="English%20for%20Speakers%20of%20Other%20Languages">English for Speakers of Other Languages</a> (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the <a href="International%20Catholic%20Migration%20Commission">International Catholic Migration Commission</a> (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills. The majority of women were not in work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.

A number of programme evaluations have found that many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at <a href="Sheffield%20Hallam%20University">Sheffield Hallam University</a> for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who had been in the UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.

Rambles in Germany and Italy

Rambles in Germany and Italy, in 1840, 1842, and 1843 is a <a href="travel%20literature">travel narrative</a> by the British <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> author <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>. Issued in 1844, it is her last published work. Published in two volumes, the text describes two European trips that Mary Shelley took with her son, <a href="Percy%20Florence%20Shelley">Percy Florence Shelley</a>, and several of his university friends. Mary Shelley had lived in Italy with her husband, <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, between 1818 and 1823. For her, Italy was associated with both joy and grief: she had written much while there but she had also lost her husband and two of her children. Thus, although she was anxious to return, the trip was tinged with sorrow. Shelley describes her journey as a <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>, which will help cure her depression.

At the end of the second trip, Mary Shelley spent time in Paris and associated herself with the "<a href="Young%20Italy%20%28historical%29">Young Italy</a>" movement, Italian exiles who were in favour of <a href="Italian%20unification">Italian independence and unification</a>. One revolutionary in particular attracted her: Ferdinando Gatteschi. To assist him financially, Shelley decided to publish "Rambles". However, Gatteschi became discontented with Shelley's assistance and tried to blackmail her. She was forced to obtain her personal letters from Gatteschi through the intervention of the French police.

Shelley differentiates her travel book from others by presenting her material from what she describes as "a political point of view". In so doing, she challenges the early nineteenth-century convention that it was improper for women to write about politics, following in the tradition of her mother, <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, and <a href="Sydney%2C%20Lady%20Morgan">Lady Morgan</a>. Shelley's aim was to arouse sympathy in England for Italian revolutionaries, such as Gatteschi. She rails against the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lombardy%E2%80%93Venetia">imperial rule of Austria</a> and France over Italy and criticises the domination of the Catholic Church. She describes the Italians as having an untapped potential for greatness and a desire for freedom.

Though Shelley herself thought the work "poor", it found favour with reviewers who praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling. Shelley's political commentary on Italy was specifically singled out for praise, particularly since it was written by a woman. For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Shelley was usually known only as the author of "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" and the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. "Rambles" was not reprinted until the rise of <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary criticism</a> in the 1970s provoked a wider interest in Shelley's entire corpus.

From the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> until the end of the nineteenth century, Italy was divided into many small <a href="duchies">duchies</a> and <a href="city-state">city-state</a>s, some of which were autonomous and some of which were controlled by Austria, France, Spain, or the <a href="Papacy">Papacy</a>. These multifarious governments and the diversity of Italian dialects spoken on the peninsula caused residents to identify as "Romans" or "Venetians", for example, rather than as "Italians". When <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> conquered parts of Italy during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a> (1792–1802) and the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> (1803–15), he unified many of the smaller principalities; he centralised the governments and built roads and communication networks that helped to break down the barriers between and among Italians. Not all Italians welcomed French rule, however; <a href="Giuseppe%20Capobianco">Giuseppe Capobianco</a> founded a secret society called the <a href="Carbonari">Carbonari</a> to resist both French rule and the Roman Catholic Church. After Napoleon was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> in 1815 and the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> left much of northern Italy in the hands of the Austrians, the Carbonari continued their resistance. The Carbonari led revolts in <a href="Naples">Naples</a> and <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> in 1820 and 1821 and in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a>, <a href="Parma">Parma</a>, and <a href="Modena">Modena</a> in the 1830s. After the failure of these revolts, <a href="Giuseppe%20Mazzini">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>, a Carbonaro who was exiled from Italy, founded the "Young Italy" group to work toward the unification of Italy, to establish a democratic republic, and to force non-Italian states to relinquish authority on the peninsula. By 1833, 60,000 people had joined the movement. These nationalist revolutionaries, with foreign support, attempted, but failed, to overthrow the Austrians in <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> and <a href="Turin">Turin</a> in 1833 and <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a> in 1844. <a href="Italian%20unification">Italian unification</a>, or "Risorgimento", was finally achieved in 1870 under the leadership of <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a>.

Mary Shelley and her husband <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a> had lived in Italy from 1818 to 1823. Although Percy Shelley and two of their four children died there, Italy became for Mary Shelley "a country which memory painted as paradise", as she put it. The couple's Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity. Percy composed a series of major poems, and Mary wrote the autobiographical novel "<a href="Matilda%20%28novella%29">Matilda</a>", the historical novel "<a href="Valperga%20%28novel%29">Valperga</a>", and the plays "<a href="Proserpine%20%28play%29">Proserpine</a>" and "<a href="Midas%20%28Shelley%29">Midas</a>". Mary Shelley had always wanted to return to Italy and she excitedly planned her 1840 trip. The return was painful as she was constantly reminded of Percy Shelley.

In June 1840, Mary Shelley, <a href="Percy%20Florence%20Shelley">Percy Florence</a> (her one surviving child), and a few of his friends—George Defell, Julian Robinson, and <a href="Robert%20Leslie%20Ellis">Robert Leslie Ellis</a>—began their European tour. They travelled to Paris and then to <a href="Metz">Metz</a>. From there, they went down the <a href="Moselle">Moselle</a> by boat to <a href="Coblenz">Coblenz</a> and then up the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> to <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>, Frankfurt, <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>, <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a>, <a href="Freiburg">Freiburg</a>, <a href="Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen</a>, <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, the <a href="Spl%C3%BCgen">Splügen</a>, and <a href="Chiavenna">Chiavenna</a>. Feeling ill, Shelley rested at a spa in Baden-Baden; she had wracking pains in her head and "convulsive shudders", symptoms of the <a href="meningioma">meningioma</a> that would eventually kill her. This stop dismayed Percy Florence and his friends, as it provided no entertainment for them; moreover, since none of them <a href="German%20language">spoke German</a>, the group was forced to remain together. After crossing Switzerland by carriage and railway, the group spent two months at <a href="Lake%20Como">Lake Como</a>, where Mary relaxed and reminisced about how she and Percy had almost rented a villa with <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a> at the lake one summer. The group then travelled on to <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, and from there, Percy Florence and his friends soon left for <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> to take their university finals. Mary Shelley remained, waiting for funds to complete her journey. In September, she returned to England via <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> and Paris. Upon her return, she became depressed and could not write: "[in Italy] I might live – as once I lived—hoping—loving—aspiring enjoying ... I am placid now, & the days go by – I am happy in Percy [Florence's] society & health – but no adjuncts ... gild the quiet hours & dulness [sic] creeps over my intellect". Despite this lethargy she managed to publish a second edition of Percy Shelley's prose and began working on another edition of his poetry.

Sir Timothy Shelley gave his grandson Percy Florence an increase in his allowance for his twenty-first birthday, allowing Mary Shelley and Percy Florence to plan a second, longer trip to the Continent. In June 1842, Mary Shelley and her son left for a fourteen-month tour. They were accompanied by a few of his friends: Alexander Andrew Knox, a poet and classicist, whom <a href="Emily%20W.%20Sunstein">Emily Sunstein</a>, a biographer of Mary Shelley, describes as "reminiscent of [Percy] Shelley"; Henry Hugh Pearson, a musician who had written musical accompaniments for several of Percy Shelley's poems; and Robert Leslie Ellis. Mary Shelley hoped that the easy manners of the other young men would rub off on her awkward son, but instead they became petty and jealous of each other. The group visited <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a>, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Coblenz, Mainz, Frankfurt, <a href="Kissingen">Kissingen</a>, Berlin, <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, Prague, <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>, the <a href="county%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a>, <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a>, <a href="Riva%20del%20Garda">Riva</a>, <a href="Verona">Verona</a>, Venice, <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, and Rome. In Rome, Mary Shelley toured museums with the French art critic Alex Rio; Percy Florence was unimpressed with the culture and refused to see the art, infuriating his mother, who spent an increasing amount of her time seeing the country with Knox instead. She also paid numerous visits to Percy Bysshe Shelley's <a href="Protestant%20Cemetery%2C%20Rome">grave in Rome</a>. After two months in the <a href="Sorrento%20Peninsula">Sorrento Peninsula</a>, the group was short of money; Percy Florence and his friends returned home while Mary Shelley went on to Paris.

In Paris, Mary Shelley associated with many of the Italian expatriates who were part of the "Young Italy" movement. Her recent travels had made her particularly sympathetic to their revolutionary message. One Italian patriot captivated her in particular: Ferdinando Gatteschi, a smart, handsome, would-be writer. He was young—not yet 30—and in exile, following his participation in a failed Carbonari rebellion against Austria in 1830–31. Shelley was fascinated by Gatteschi; she described him as "a hero & an angel & martyr". Jeanne Moskal, the most recent editor of "Rambles", argues that Mary Shelley was attracted to Gatteschi because he resembled Percy Shelley: he was an aristocratic writer who had been cast off by his parents for his liberalism. Moskal argues that "the strength of [Shelley's] devotion overturned her previous resolve not to publish again".

At the end of September 1843, Mary Shelley proposed to her publisher, <a href="Edward%20Moxon">Edward Moxon</a>, that she write a travel book based on her 1840 and 1842 Continental journeys. Interested in assisting Gatteschi, she wrote to Moxon that she was writing "for a purpose most urgent & desirable". She described the work as "light", "personal", and "amusing". Moxon agreed to her proposal and advanced her £60, which she promised to return if fewer than 300 copies of the work were sold. (She subsequently gave this same amount to Gatteschi.) By the end of January 1844, Shelley had already completed most of the first volume. As Sunstein writes, "once started on "Rambles", she worked fast and with pleasure, but her head and nerves were bad at times, and her eyes got so weak and inflamed that she wrote only until noon." She left Paris at the end of January and returned to London, still infatuated with Gatteschi. The death of Sir Timothy Shelley, Percy Florence's grandfather, in April 1844, delayed the completion of the work. However, with material from Gatteschi on the <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a> uprising of 1831 and research help from German-speaking friends, Shelley finished. The text was largely drawn from correspondence written during her travels to her step-sister <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</a>. Mary Shelley's last published work, which was dedicated to the travel writer and poet <a href="Samuel%20Rogers">Samuel Rogers</a>, came out on 1 August 1844.

Despite Mary Shelley's attempts to assist Gatteschi financially, he tried to blackmail her one year later in 1845 using indiscreet letters she had written. After not hearing from Gatteschi for months, she received threatening letters, which claimed that she had promised him financial success and even possibly marriage. He claimed that her letters would demonstrate this. The contents of Mary Shelley's letters are unknown as they were later destroyed, but she must have felt some danger, for she took great pains to recover the letters and wrote agonised letters to her friends: "[The letters] were written with an open heart – & contain details with regard to my past history, which it [would] destroy me for ever if they ever saw light." Shelley turned to Alexander Knox for help. After obtaining help from the British government, he travelled to Paris and had the Paris police seize Gatteschi's correspondence. Implying that Gatteschi was a danger to the state, Knox and the Paris police called upon the "<a href="cabinet%20noir">cabinet noir</a>" system in order to retrieve the letters. On 11 October, "<a href="Le%20National%20%28newspaper%29">Le National</a>" and "<a href="Le%20Constitutionnel">Le Constitutionnel</a>" reported in outrage that Gatteschi's personal papers were seized because he was a suspected revolutionary. Mary wrote to Claire that "It is an awful power this seizure", but she did not regret using it. After Knox retrieved her letters, he burned them. Shelley spent £250 of her own money to finance the operation. She was embarrassed by the entire incident.

The two volumes of "Rambles" are divided into three parts. Part I, which occupies part of the first volume, describes the four-month trip Mary Shelley took with Percy Florence and his university friends in 1840. Parts II and III, which comprise the remainder of the first volume and the entirety of the second volume, describe the fourteen-month trip Mary Shelley took with Percy Florence, Alexander Knox, and other university friends in 1842 and 1843. Part II covers June – August 1842 and Part III covers August 1842 – September 1843. All three parts are epistolary and cover a wide range of topics: "these include personal narratives of the difficulty of a journey, on her varying health, her budgetary constraint; comments on whether [John] <a href="Murray%27s%20Handbooks%20for%20Travellers">Murray's guide-book</a> advice as to hotels, routes or sights was reliable; her subjective responses to the pictures, statues, cities and landscapes she has seen; reports on her occupations and those of her companions; historical disquisitions on such topics as the Tyrolean struggle against Napoleon, or the origins of the Carbonari; and authoritative analysis of the present and future state of Italian literature."

In twelve conversational letters written in the <a href="First-person%20narrative">first person</a>, Mary Shelley charts her travels through Europe during 1840 and her reflections on accommodations, scenery, peasants, economic relationships between the classes, art, literature, and memories of her 1814 and 1816 journeys (recorded in "<a href="History%20of%20a%20Six%20Weeks%27%20Tour">History of a Six Weeks' Tour</a>" (1817)). In the first letter, she muses on her return to Italy:

After landing in France, Shelley continues to happily anticipate her travels and the benefits she will derive from them. Travelling throughout <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, she complains about the slowness of travel but is pleased to discover that her memories of the Rhine correspond to the reality. Shelley becomes ill in Germany and pauses at <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a> to recover her health. Fearing Percy Florence's (referred to as P– in the text) love of boats and the water, especially difficult for her after her own husband drowned in a boating accident, she is reluctant to continue to Italy and Lake Como while at the same time desiring to do so. After Shelley recovers her health and spirits, the group proceeds to Italy where she is overcome with nostalgia:
Shelley writes of her overwhelming happiness in Italy and her sadness at having to leave it. At the end of September, her money to return to England fails to arrive, so Percy Florence and his friends return without her. Her funds eventually arrive, and she journeys to England alone. In the letters covering her return journey, she describes the <a href="Sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> scenery through which she travels, particularly the <a href="Simplon%20Pass">Simplon Pass</a> and waterfalls in Switzerland.

Part II, which consists of eleven conversational letters, covers the first part of Shelley's trip to Europe in 1842, specifically her journey from <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> to <a href="Prague">Prague</a>; the names of her travelling companions are disguised in the text and she rarely alludes to them. She discusses art, sometimes spending several pages describing individual works of art; the benefits and drawbacks of travel by railway versus carriage; the German character and habits of the <a href="German%20people">German people</a>; the history associated with the sights she sees; the scenery and the weather; and her problems as a traveller, for example, her inability to speak German, the dirtiness of the inns, and exorbitant pricing for tourists. Shelley begins this section by musing on the benefits of travel:

Briefly passing through a quick succession of <a href="German%20cities">German cities</a> by railway, carriage, and boat, the group arrives at <a href="Kissingen">Kissingen</a>, where they decide to remain for a month for Shelley to "take the cure" at the bath. While Shelley believes the waters will be efficacious, she chafes at the restrictions put on those attempting to better their health, such as rising at five or six and eating no delicacies. Her companions are increasingly frustrated by the schedule and the lack of entertainment at the spa. After leaving Kissingen, the group travels through the area around <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>, seeing sights associated with <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> and the writers <a href="Christoph%20Martin%20Wieland">Wieland</a>, <a href="Schiller">Schiller</a>, and <a href="Goethe">Goethe</a>. They continue to Berlin and Dresden, where they spend time viewing art and attending the opera, leaving for Prague in August 1842.

Throughout 23 informal letters, Shelley describes her travels from Prague to southern Italy. She ponders the scenery of the areas she passes through, the <a href="history%20of%20Germany">history of Germany</a> and Italy (e.g. the <a href="History%20of%20Tyrol%23Napoleonic%20Wars">Tyrolenese rebellion of April 1809</a> and the activities of the <a href="Carbonari">Carbonari</a>), the art of <a href="Italian%20Baroque">Baroque</a> and <a href="Italian%20Renaissance%20painting">Renaissance Italy</a>, the <a href="Italian%20literature">literature of Italy</a>, and offers opinions on Italy's recent governments, the national character of the German and Italian people, and Catholicism. She also ponders the changes in herself from who she was in the 1820s to who she is in the 1840s, particularly in relation to her grief:

"Rambles" is a <a href="travel%20literature">travel narrative</a>, part of a literary tradition begun in the seventeenth century. Through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, Continental travel was considered educational: young, aristocratic gentlemen completed their studies by learning European languages abroad and visiting foreign courts. In the early seventeenth century, however, the emphasis shifted from <a href="classics">classical learning</a> to a focus on gaining experience in the real world, such as knowledge of topography, history, and culture. Detailed travel books, including personal travel narratives, began to be published and became popular in the eighteenth century: over 1,000 individual travel narratives and travel miscellanies were published between 1660 and 1800. The empiricism that was driving the <a href="scientific%20revolution">scientific revolution</a> spread to travel literature; for example, <a href="Lady%20Mary%20Wortley%20Montagu">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</a> included information she learned in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> regarding <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> inoculation in her travel letters. By 1742, critic and essayist <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> was recommending that travellers engage in "a moral and ethical study of men and manners" in addition to a scientific study of topography and geography.

Over the course of the eighteenth century, the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> became increasingly popular. Travel to the Continent for Britain's elite was not only educational but also nationalistic. All aristocratic gentlemen took similar trips and visited similar sites, with the intention of developing an appreciation of Britain from abroad. The Grand Tour was celebrated as educational travel when it involved exchanging scientific information with the intellectual elite, learning about other cultures, and preparing for leadership. However, it was condemned as trivial when the tourist simply purchased <a href="curio%20%28furniture%29">curio</a> collectibles, acquired a "superficial social polish", and pursued fleeting sexual relationships. During the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the Continent was <a href="Continental%20System">closed to British travellers</a> and the Grand Tour came under increasing criticism, particularly from <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radicals</a> such as Mary Shelley's father, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, who scorned its aristocratic associations. Young Romantic writers criticised its lack of spontaneity; they celebrated <a href="Germaine%20de%20Sta%C3%ABl">Madame de Staёl's</a> novel "<a href="Corinne%20%28novel%29">Corinne</a>" (1807), which depicts proper travel as "immediate, sensitive, and above all [an] enthusiastic experience".

Travel literature changed in the 1840s as steam-powered ships and trains made Continental journeys accessible to the middle class. Guidebooks and handbooks were published for this new traveller, who was unfamiliar with the tradition of the Grand Tour. The most famous of these was <a href="John%20Murray%20%281778%E2%80%931843%29">John Murray's</a> "Handbook for Travellers on the Continent" (1836). By 1848, Murray had published 60 such works, which "emphasised comprehensiveness, presenting numerous possible itineraries and including information on geology, history, and art galleries". Whereas during the Romantic period, travel writers differentiated themselves from mere tourists through the spontaneity and exuberance of their reactions, during the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian period</a>, travel writers attempted to legitimise their works through a "discourse of authenticity". That is, they claimed to have experienced the true culture of an area and their reactions to it were specifically personal, as opposed to the writers of generic guidebooks, whose response was specifically impersonal.

Mary Shelley's "Rambles" both resembles and attempts to separate itself from other travel narratives of the time. Elizabeth Nitchie, in her description of the text, writes, for example, that there is "little novelty either in what [Shelley] saw or in her account" of the Alps, the Rhine, or Italy, and Moskal notes that Shelley's "book participates in the travel-book convention of museum-going". Although Shelley drew on Murray's famous handbooks and other guidebooks, she specifically attempted to differentiate her work from these. While Murray's guidebooks, for example, were generally apolitical, Shelley argues in the preface to "Rambles" that the uniqueness of her work is in its portrayal of the Italian people from "a political point of view". Shelley had sold her publisher on the idea of a travel narrative by describing the forthcoming book as "light" and "amusing", in the style of <a href="Samuel%20Rogers">Samuel Rogers</a>, whose travel narrative of Italy, accompanied by illustrations by <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>, had been a best-seller in the late 1820s. Rogers's text had avoided politics and focused on <a href="picturesque">picturesque</a> and <a href="Sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> scenery. Although Shelley dedicated "Rambles" to Rogers, her preface acknowledged the influence of <a href="Sydney%2C%20Lady%20Morgan">Lady Morgan</a>, whose travel work, "<a href="Italy%20%28Morgan%29">Italy</a>" (1821), had been vocal in its criticism of Austria's rule over Italy and had been placed on the <a href="Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum">papal list of prohibited books</a>. To make her politics more palatable to her audience, however, Shelley often uses analyses of literature and art to reiforce her points.

Shelley's travel narrative, with its "informal" and "subjective" focus on her personal experiences, reflects the Romantic emphasis on the individual. Unlike <a href="Augustus%20Bozzi%20Granville">Augustus Bozzi Granville</a>'s "The Spas of Germany" (1837), which exudes a Victorian respect for order, political authority, and careful documentation, Shelley focuses on her own reactions to these experiences. She specifically criticises the surveillance and control methods used at the spas she visited, such as the strict dietary regimens and confiscation of letters.

In choosing to focus her travel narrative on politics, Mary Shelley violated the mid-nineteenth century taboo against women discussing politics, particularly in the public sphere. After the mid-1790s (partly as a result of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>), Britain experienced an "antifeminist reaction" and women were increasingly discouraged from writing on so-called "masculine" topics. As Moskal explains, there was a "massive cultural prejudice that equate[d] masculinity with mobility", making travel writing itself a masculine genre; there was even a "masculinist aesthetic vocabulary". Women in the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century wrote travel narratives anyway, but at a cost. Wollstonecraft is described as asking "men's questions" when she is curious about her surroundings and both Lady Morgan's and <a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>'s travel narratives received hostile reviews because they discussed political issues.

Both Shelley and her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, exceeded the bounds of what would have been considered "the normal purview of the female writer" in their travel narratives. Shelley excitedly describes running the rapids in a canoe, for example, and describes the economic status and technological development of the areas she visits. In Paris, she comments on the lack of drains in the streets, in Berlin she visits a steel mill, and throughout the text she describes how the new railways are impacting on travel. Shelley's travel narrative is marked by a specific "ethic of travel"—that one must learn to sympathise both physically and emotionally with those one encounters. Her travels are <a href="Sentimentality">sentimental</a>, and travel writing for her is "an exploration of the self through an encounter with the other". Her language even mirrors that of her mother. Wollstonecraft describes the frontier of Sweden as "the bones of the world waiting to be clothed with everything necessary to give life and beauty" while Shelley describes the <a href="Simplon%20Pass">Simplon Pass</a> as having "a majestic simplicity that inspired awe; the naked bones of a gigantic world were here: the elemental substance of fair mother Earth".

Also like her mother, whose "Letters from Sweden" was foundational to the writing of both "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" and "Rambles", Shelley emphasised her maternal role in the text. She describes herself as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the "Tour", she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.

Shelley's stated aim in "Rambles" is to raise awareness of the political situation in Italy and to convince readers to aid the revolutionaries in their fight for independence. She addresses her readers as English citizens, arguing that they in particular "ought to sympathise in [the Italians'] struggles; for the aspiration for free institutions all over the world has its source in England". On a general level, she articulates an "opposition to monarchical government, disapproval of class distinction, abhorrence of slavery and war and their concomitant cruelties" similar to that in her historical novels "<a href="Valperga%20%28novel%29">Valperga</a>" (1823) and "<a href="The%20Fortunes%20of%20Perkin%20Warbeck">Perkin Warbeck</a>" (1830). The central theme of the second journey is "the tyranny of Austrian and French imperialism, and the abuses of papal and priestly authority". The solution to Italy's problems, according to Shelley, is neither "subjugation" nor "revolution" but rather "peaceful mediation". Ultimately, it is the lessons learned from history that Shelley feels are the most important, which is why she compares the past and present. "Rambles" articulates the "Whiggish ideology of political gradualism", and is similar to Wollstonecraft's "<a href="Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792) in that it argues that "a reformation of culture is necessary to reform oppressive and degrading power relations".

Shelley's political frame for her travel narrative was a difficult one to sell to readers. Her audience wanted to support the revolutionaries, especially exiles living among them, such as Mazzini, but they were also fearful of the violence of the Carbonari and its nationalist ideology. They connected nationalism to their historic enemy—Napoleonic France. In fact, other travel works published at the time made the argument that Napoleon was responsible for Italian unification. Shelley therefore contends that the "Risorgimento" is primarily inspired by the English and only secondarily by the French (she never names Napoleon). Shelley writes a history of <a href="Italian%20nationalism">Italian nationalism</a> acceptable to English readers, in which the French are the tyrants oppressing the rising nation of Italy, which the Carbonari, although violent, has inspired and created. Her readers could therefore comfortably support Italian nationalism without supporting policies reminiscent of Napoleon. She also placed most of her political commentary at the end of the text. As Moskal explains, "Shelley creates a structure in which the reader, having already befriended the traveller for some pages, receives this political matter from a friend, not from a stranger." She also praises Italian literature, particularly the works of <a href="Alessandro%20Manzoni">Alessandro Manzoni</a>, <a href="Pietro%20Colletta">Pietro Colletta</a>, and <a href="Michele%20Amari">Michele Amari</a>, connecting it to Italian nationalism.

In writing about the Italian situation, Shelley is also advocating a general liberal agenda of rights for the working and middle classes, which had been crushed by the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> and Napoleon. British reformers could look with hope towards Italy.

Throughout "Rambles", Shelley describes the national character of the peoples she visits. She describes the Italians as having an untapped potential for greatness, particularly the peasants:

Shelley frequently laments the poor education on offer to Italians, although she hopes this will spur them to revolt. She does not think much of the Germans. In her earlier travels, she had described the Germans as rude and disgusting; in 1842, she wrote to her half-sister <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</a>, "I do dislike the Germans—& never wish to visit Germany again—but I would not put this in print—for the surface is all I know." "Rambles" contains little commentary on the Germans, therefore, except to say that she was impressed by the public education system of Germany.

It was how political events affected people that Shelley was most interested in. In her "History of a Six Weeks' Tour", she had paused several times to discuss the effects of war and she does so again with her description of the <a href="Hessian%20%28soldiers%29">Hessians</a> in "Rambles":

Shelley's trips to Italy were a way for her to revisit memories of her dead husband, Percy Shelley, and the children they had buried there. Moskal argues that Shelley needed to "expiate" her <a href="survivor%20guilt">survivor guilt</a> and Dolan that she needed to recover from a damaging <a href="Psychological%20trauma">trauma</a>. Shelley writes about this in "Rambles", using the <a href="Trope%20%28literature%29">trope</a> of a pilgrimage; she believes that travelling to Italy and revisiting the scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression, writing, "Besides all that Rome itself affords of delightful to the eye and imagination, I revisit it as the bourne of a pious pilgrimage. The treasures of my youth lie buried here." Shelley's pilgrimage follows in the tradition of <a href="Chaucer">Chaucer</a> as well as the nineteenth-century trend to visit spas for healing, and like most pilgrimage narratives, hers does not relate the journey home. For Shelley, ultimately the most helpful part of travelling and visiting spas was seeing the beautiful scenery. In "Rambles", Shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal the body. Both the 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for Shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically. She opens "Rambles" by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her "mind will ... renew the outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed".

Shelley's first travel narrative and first published work, "History of a Six Weeks' Tour", was published anonymously and was co-written with her husband. "Rambles", on the other hand, places Mary Shelley at the centre of the narrative. It tells the story of "the recovery of paradise" and the fears of a mother. Her maternal sorrow is generalised. For example, in discussing the death of her daughter in 1818, she writes: "I was agitated again by emotions—by passions—and those the deepest a woman's heart can harbour—a dread to see her child even at that instant expire—which then occupied me". Connecting these deep feelings to writings by <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, <a href="Wordsworth">Wordsworth</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Coleridge</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Holcroft">Thomas Holcroft</a>, she argues that intense emotion and environment are intertwined, contending that maternal grief is <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a>.

Of "Rambles", Mary Shelley wrote to her friend <a href="Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a>: "It seems to me such a wretched piece of work, written much of it in a state of pain that makes me look at its pages now as if written in a dream." She disliked the work, describing it variously as "a poor affair" and "my poor book", and claimed that Gatteschi had written the best parts. There are no statistics on the sales of the book, but it received at least seventeen reviews. In general, the reviews were favourable; as Moskal explains, "with nationalist movements simmering in Europe, to culminate in the revolutions of 1848, reviewers took "Rambles" seriously as a political as well as a literary endeavour."

Reviewers praised the work as "entertaining, thoughtful and eminently readable", although some thought it was too mournful in places. Separating Shelley's travel memoir from the new guidebooks and handbooks, reviews such as that from the "Atlas", praised her "rich fancy, her intense love of nature, and her sensitive apprehension of all that is good, and beautiful and free". They praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling. Shelley's commentary on the social and political life of Italy, which was generally thought superior to the German sections, caused one reviewer to call the book the work of "a woman who thinks for herself on all subjects, and who dares to say what she thinks", a woman with a "masculine and original mind". Not all reviewers celebrated her independence of mind. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" wrote: "With her, as with all women, politics is a matter of the heart, and not as with the more robust nature of man, of the head ... It is an idle and unprofitable theme for a woman." Most of the reviews responded positively to Shelley's political aims; those that were unsympathetic to her political position generally disputed her specific claims. For example, one reviewer claimed that Italy had been improved by Austrian rule.

For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mary Shelley was known as the author of "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" and the wife of famous <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic poet</a> Percy Bysshe Shelley. As late as 1961, "Rambles" had never been reprinted and, as scholar Elizabeth Nitchie explained, "scant use has been made of it, and copies of it are rather scarce." However, she argued that some of Mary Shelley's "best writing" was in "Rambles". Novelist <a href="Muriel%20Spark">Muriel Spark</a> agreed in her book on Shelley, writing that "Rambles" "contains more humour and liveliness than occur in anything else she wrote". In the 1970s, with the rise of <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary criticism</a>, scholars began to pay attention to Shelley's other works. With the publication of scholarship by <a href="Mary%20Poovey">Mary Poovey</a> and <a href="Anne%20K.%20Mellor">Anne K. Mellor</a> in the 1980s, Mary Shelley's "other" works—her short stories, essays, reviews, dramas, biographies, travel narratives, and other novels—began to be recognised as literary achievements. In the 1990s, Mary Shelley's entire corpus, including "Rambles", was reprinted.

Tottenham Outrage

The Tottenham Outrage of 23 January 1909 was an <a href="Robbery">armed robbery</a> in <a href="Tottenham">Tottenham</a>, <a href="North%20London">North London</a>, that resulted in a two-hour chase between the police and armed criminals over a distance of , with an estimated 400 <a href="Ammunition">rounds of ammunition</a> fired by the thieves. The robbery, of workers' wages from the Schnurmann rubber factory, was carried out by Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus, Jewish Latvian immigrants. Of the twenty-three casualties, two were fatal and several others serious, among them seven policemen. The two thieves committed suicide at the end of the pursuit.

Helfeld and Lepidus were members of the Latvian Socialist Party responsible for smuggling revolutionary literature into Russia. Both had been living with Lepidus's brother Paul in Paris in 1907 when Paul was killed by the premature detonation of the bomb he was carrying to assassinate the president of France, <a href="Armand%20Falli%C3%A8res">Armand Fallières</a>. They fled France to north London, where they became members of a small group of Latvian agitators. For some time before the robbery, Helfeld was employed at the Schnurmann factory.

The bravery of the police during the chase led to the creation of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Police%20Medal">King's Police Medal</a>, which was awarded to several of those involved in the pursuit. A joint funeral for the two victims—<a href="Constable%23United%20Kingdom">Police Constable</a> William Tyler and Ralph Joscelyne, a ten-year-old boy—was attended by a crowd of up to half a million mourners, including 2,000 policemen. The event exacerbated ill feeling towards immigrants in London, and much of the press coverage was anti-Semitic in nature. This affected public sentiment after another criminal act by Latvian immigrants in December 1910, culminating in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sidney%20Street">Siege of Sidney Street</a>, in which three policemen were murdered.

In the 19th century the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, then including <a href="Latvia%23Latvia%20in%20the%20Russian%20Empire%20%281710%E2%80%931917%29">Latvia</a>, was home to about <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Russia">five million Jews</a>, the largest Jewish community in the world at the time. Subjected to religious persecution and violent <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s, many emigrated, and between 1875 and 1914 around 120,000 arrived in the United Kingdom, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20England%231880s%20to%201920">mostly in England</a>. The influx reached its peak in the late 1890s when large numbers of Jewish immigrants—mostly poor and semi-skilled or unskilled—settled in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a>; the concentration of Jews in some areas of London was almost 100 per cent of the population. Because of the influx of Jews and Russians into one part of <a href="Tottenham">Tottenham</a> in <a href="North%20London">North London</a>, the area gained the nickname <a href="Little%20Russia%2C%20London">Little Russia</a>.

Some of the expatriates were revolutionaries, and many were unable to adapt to life in London. The social historian <a href="William%20J.%20Fishman">William J. Fishman</a> writes that "the "" (crazy) <a href="Anarchism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Anarchists</a> were almost accepted as part of the East End landscape"; the terms "<a href="Socialism">socialist</a>" and "<a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a>" had been conflated by the British press to refer generally to those with revolutionary beliefs.

Several revolutionary factions were active in East and North London. One tactic often employed by revolutionaries in Russia was the expropriation of private property to fund radical activities. The influx of émigrés, and the associated rising rates of violent crime, led to widespread concerns and press coverage. As a result, the <a href="Unionist%20government%2C%201895%E2%80%931905">British government</a> passed the <a href="Aliens%20Act%201905">Aliens Act 1905</a> in an attempt to reduce immigration. The popular press reflected the opinions of many; a <a href="Editorial">leading article</a> in the "<a href="Manchester%20Evening%20Chronicle">Manchester Evening Chronicle</a>" supported the bill to bar "the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil". The journalist <a href="Robert%20Winder">Robert Winder</a>, in his examination of immigration into Britain, opines that the Act "gave official sanction to xenophobic reflexes which might ... have remained dormant".

Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the "" "Strygia"; Jacob was described in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as a "member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate <a href="Armand%20Falli%C3%A8res">Armand Fallières</a>, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.

Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as "Elephant" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of <a href="Tottenham%20High%20Road">Tottenham High Road</a> and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a>.

<a href="Special%20Branch%23United%20Kingdom">Special Branch</a> suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery. Salnish, who often went under the name Jacob Fogel, had been an active revolutionary since the age of 13. He participated in the <a href="1905%20Russian%20Revolution">1905 Russian Revolution</a> and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a> and <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, then the capital of <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Imperial Russia</a>. Special Branch suspected a political element to the crime based on Salnish's involvement, but as both Helfeld and Lepidus died during the chase, the motivation for the crime was never established.

On 23 January 1909 Helfeld and Lepidus waited outside the Schnurmann factory. At the same time every week Schnurmann's chauffeur, Joseph Wilson, drove to a bank in nearby <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Hackney">Hackney</a> with Albert Keyworth, a 17-year-old office boy. They collected the week's wages—on the 23rd it was £80 in gold, silver and <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">coppers</a>—and returned to the factory, arriving at about 10:30 am. The car stopped to allow Keyworth—holding the bag of money—to open the gates; as it started to pull off, Lepidus grabbed the boy and tried to take the bag from him, but Keyworth held him off. Wilson stopped the car and came to Keyworth's assistance. As the trio wrestled, Wilson fell to the ground and Lepidus managed to take the bag. Helfeld joined the fight; he drew his gun—a <a href="FN%20M1900">.32 calibre Browning</a>—and fired several times at Wilson. The shots hit Wilson's coat; one pierced his clothes and cut across his abdomen. The police report stated that it was "in a miraculous and unaccountable way [that] he escaped injury".

Two <a href="Constable%23United%20Kingdom">police constables</a> (PCs)—Tyler and Newman—at the nearby police station heard the shots, left the station and chased the two men down Chesnut Road. Part way down the road, George Smith, a passer-by, threw Lepidus to the ground. As they wrestled, Helfeld fired at Smith four times; two shots went through his cap—one of which scraped his scalp—another hit him in the collarbone and one missed altogether. As the two gunmen ran down the street, other members of the public joined the chase, as did several off-duty policemen from the station—<a href="police%20use%20of%20firearms%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">none carrying firearms</a>—some on foot, but some having <a href="Commandeering">commandeered</a> bicycles from passers-by. One policeman was able to return fire with a pistol borrowed from a member of the public. The car from the factory joined in the pursuit, driven by Wilson; he paused and PC Newman boarded the car before they gave chase again. Tyler ran alongside the car.

As the car approached them, the two criminals turned and opened fire. One round broke the car's water pipe, disabling it, and Wilson received a minor wound to the neck; Newman's cheek and ear were damaged by one shot. Members of the public attempted to take cover, but one—Ralph Joscelyne, a ten-year-old boy—was caught by a round to the chest. Someone took him to hospital on a bicycle, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. The gunmen continued their escape, and headed towards <a href="Tottenham%20Marshes">Tottenham Marshes</a>. PCs Tyler and Newman took a short cut, and confronted the two men near the site of a rubbish incinerator. Tyler approached the men and, when he was within , was heard to say "Come on; give in, the game's up". Helfeld took aim and shot him; the bullet went through his head. The two criminals took off again, while Tyler was carried to a nearby house and an ambulance summoned. He was taken to Tottenham Hospital, where he died five minutes after arrival.

Helfeld and Lepidus crossed the nearby railway line and followed the west bank of the <a href="River%20Lea">River Lea</a> until they crossed over; they were able to hold off the crowd from the bridge. Men who had been duck shooting on the marshes used their shotguns to return fire and when the two criminals moved on from the bridge, local footballers joined in the chase. Helfeld and Lepidus ran along the western bank of the <a href="Lee%20Navigation">Lee Navigation</a> canal; local workmen followed on the opposite bank in an attempt to cut them off, but several were wounded when the two men fired at them. The pair crossed the canal at <a href="Stonebridge%20Lock">Stonebridge Lock</a>, then crossed another bridge and again held off the chasing crowd from the bridge's parapet. One policeman, PC Nicod, borrowed a pistol from a bystander and made his way through the scrub until he was close enough to fire, but the gun was faulty; he was seen by Helfeld and Lepidus, who fired on him, wounding him in the calf and thigh.
Helfeld and Lepidus continued their flight along the south side of <a href="Banbury%20Reservoir">Banbury Reservoir</a>. As they crossed an area of open land, they sheltered behind a haystack and held off the pursuers, who numbered about 20 at this point. The two ran on until they reached Chingford Road, where they boarded a number 9 <a href="tram">tram</a>; many of the passengers escaped, and the driver, who saw the armed men, ran up the front stairs of the vehicle and hid on the top deck. Lepidus threatened the conductor with a pistol and ordered him to drive; although he had never driven a tram before, he managed to get the vehicle moving. Lepidus stayed with his pistol trained on the conductor, while Helfeld shot at the pursuers behind them. One policeman commandeered a pony and cart; he was armed and tried to get close enough to manage an aimed shot, but Helfeld shot the horse and the cart overturned. A tram on the return journey from that of number 9 was commandeered by a policeman; 40 others boarded it and it reversed down the track in pursuit. The conductor, wanting to get rid of the two men, told them that there was a police station around the next corner. The two criminals jumped off the tram near a horse-drawn <a href="milk%20float">milk float</a>, shooting the driver and stealing his vehicle. They fled in the direction of <a href="Epping%20Forest">Epping Forest</a>.

The milk cart overturned when the men tried to take a corner too fast, and they threatened a grocer's boy before stealing his delivery cart; Lepidus drove while Helfeld sat at the back, shooting at pursuers. A policeman commandeered a car and he, with an armed colleague, kept up pursuit. The cart did not travel very fast because, unbeknown to Lepidus, its brake was still on, and one of the wheels was not operating. The horse was soon spent, and the two men abandoned it, taking off on foot along the bank of the <a href="River%20Ching">River Ching</a>. The footpath was bordered by a -high fence and, as it continued, it narrowed to the point of being impassable. It was too late for the men to turn back and they decided to climb over; Lepidus managed to make it, but Helfeld, exhausted by the chase, could not manage to climb. He shouted to Lepidus to save himself and, as the police closed in, he put the gun to his head and shot himself. The bullet entered the head half an inch above the right eye and exited through the forehead on the other side. He was disarmed before he could fire again, and was struggling as he was overpowered; he was taken to Tottenham Hospital.

Lepidus continued his flight into <a href="Hale%20End">Hale End</a>, <a href="Walthamstow">Walthamstow</a>. He crossed the nearby railway line and took refuge in Oak Cottage, a small <a href="two-up%20two-down">two-up two-down</a> where a Mrs Rolstone and her children were present. Mrs Rolstone was at the front gate, having left the house on hearing the police whistles, when Lepidus entered the house behind her and bolted the door. When she saw Lepidus through the window—locked in with her children—she screamed, which attracted the police.

When Lepidus went upstairs, one policeman, PC Dewhurst, broke in through a downstairs window and removed the children from the house. PC Charles Eagles borrowed a pistol from a bystander and climbed a ladder at the back of the house. He was in a position to shoot, but he did not understand how the safety catch worked, and the gun failed to fire. Eagles descended and entered the house with PC John Cater and Detective Constable Charles Dixon. The three noticed sooty hand prints on the wall, where Lepidus had tried to hide up the chimney. Using a double-barrelled shotgun, Dixon shot through the door of the bedroom Lepidus had entered, while Cater and Eagles shot with revolvers. All three entered the room as Lepidus pulled a sheet over his head. Eagles and Dixon both fired as they entered, while Lepidus shot himself in the head. The police dragged him outside, where he died a few minutes later.

The incident had lasted over two hours and covered a distance of ; Helfeld and Lepidus had fired an estimated 400 rounds of ammunition. Twenty-three casualties were reported, two of them fatal and several others serious. Seven policemen were among the casualties. The money from the robbery was never recovered.

Two <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquests</a> were held on 26 January 1909, that of Lepidus in Walthamstow, and that of PC Tyler and 10-year-old Ralph Joscelyne in Tottenham. The coroner in the Walthamstow inquest described Lepidus as a "secret revolutionary agent", and said that the law would have to change to stop such criminal elements entering Britain. Although Constable Eagles believed he had fired the shot that killed Lepidus, the round extracted from the dead man's head indicated otherwise. The jury passed a verdict of suicide.

The inquest at Tottenham heard evidence through the day and adjourned until the following week. When the verdict was given, it was for the <a href="wilful%20murder">wilful murder</a> of PC Tyler by Helfeld, for which the coroner used the authority of his court to commit the Latvian to trial. Joscelyne's death, the jury decided, had been caused by Helfeld and Lepidus together.

Joscelyne and Tyler's joint funeral was held on 29 January 1909, attended by Sir <a href="Edward%20Henry">Edward Henry</a>, the <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Commissioner of Police</a>, and <a href="Herbert%20Samuel%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Samuel">Herbert Samuel</a>, <a href="Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Home%20Department">Under-Secretary of State</a> for the <a href="Home%20Department">Home Department</a>. The cortège passed along a two-and-a-half mile (four km) route lined by 2,000 police officers and a large crowd, estimated at up to 500,000. The lengthy procession included white-plumed horses drawing Joscelyne's coffin and black-plumed horses drawing Tyler's; each was draped with a <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a>. They were escorted by policemen, a police band, men from the local fire brigade, a contingent from <a href="Royal%20Garrison%20Artillery">Royal Garrison Artillery</a> and tramway employees. A volley of guns was fired at the end. The two were buried near each other at <a href="Abney%20Park%20Cemetery">Abney Park Cemetery</a>.

Lepidus was buried the same day as Joscelyne and Tyler. He was interred in <a href="unconsecrated%20ground">unconsecrated ground</a> in a Walthamstow cemetery in a ceremony closed to the public. An armed guard was kept around Tottenham Hospital in case Helfeld tried to escape. Although his wounds had begun to heal, he contracted <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>. Surgery was carried out on 9 February to remove pieces of bone pressing into the wound; the meningitis worsened and he died on 12 February. Before his death he said the only words he was heard to have uttered in hospital: "My mother is in <a href="Riga">Riga</a>." An inquest recorded a verdict of suicide. He was buried in an unconsecrated area of a cemetery near Tottenham Hospital.

Ralph Joscelyne's father died soon after his son's murder; Ralph's mother kept the shoes her son had been wearing on the day he was killed. Following her wishes, they were buried with her when she died in 1953. A collection was taken for PC Tyler's widow, which raised £1,055; she was only paid the interest, in addition to her widow's pension of £15 a year. She later married PC Williams, who had taken part in the chase; he died in 1925. On her death, the capital sum of the money raised for her was paid to the Metropolitan and City of London Police orphanage fund.

The <a href="Queen%27s%20Police%20Medal">King's Police Medal</a> was established by a <a href="Warrant%20%28law%29">Royal Warrant</a>, dated 7 July 1909, to recognise the bravery of the officers who had pursued Lepidus and Helfeld. Eagles, Cater and Dixon, the three officers who broke into Oak Cottage to apprehend Lepidus, were among the first recipients announced on 9 November 1909. The three were also among five officers promoted to the rank of <a href="Sergeant%23United%20Kingdom">sergeant</a> without the need for the usual examination; Nicod and Dewhurst were the others who rose in rank. Two others were raised to the highest level of their pay grades. Seven were granted financial awards from the Bow Street Court Reward Fund.

In November 1909 a monument to PC Tyler was built at his grave; the £200 cost was paid by members of the Metropolitan Police. The memorial was designated a <a href="listed%20building">Grade II listed structure</a> on 24 March 1997 by English Heritage (now <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a>). A cross was carved into a wall where PC Tyler was shot, and a plaque in his memory was installed at Tottenham police station. A <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> in memory of Joscelyne was placed at the Church of the Good Shepherd, Tottenham, and one indicating the end of the chase at the approximate site of Oak Cottage (now destroyed).

Following the events at Tottenham, Sir Edward Henry set up a board to examine compensation claims made by members of the public. The board was also instructed to examine whether the firearm used by the police—the .450 <a href="Webley%20Revolver">Webley Revolver</a>—was suitable, and whether sufficient numbers had been issued. The recommendation was that the Webley should be replaced by the <a href="Colt%20Model%201903%20Pocket%20Hammer">Colt Automatic pistol</a>, although no change was made. A subsequent decision was for a British-made firearm, the <a href="Webley%20%26amp%3B%20Scott%23Webley%20.26%20Scott%20automatic%20pistols">Webley & Scott .32 calibre MP semi-automatic pistol</a>. These changes had not been implemented by the end of December 1910, when a group of Latvian revolutionaries undertook an attempted break-in at a jewellery shop, which led to the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sidney%20Street">Siege of Sidney Street</a>. That event led to the murder of three policemen, the wounding of two others and a gun battle which involved the military being deployed in London. A further review after the Sidney Street murders resulted in the Metropolitan Police replacing the Webley revolver with the Webley & Scott .32 calibre MP semi-automatic pistol in 1911; the City of London Police adopted the same weapon in 1912.

The events of the Tottenham Outrage were re-enacted in "Doctor Brian Pellie and the Secret Despatch" (1912), a <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>. A fact-based, but highly fictionalised re-imagining of the events form a sub-plot of the 2014 novel "The Tottenham Outrage" by <a href="Matthew%20Baylis">Matthew Baylis</a>.

Although there was some initial confusion about the backgrounds of Helfeld and Lepidus—"<a href="The%20Star%20%28London%29">The Star</a>" reported that they were Italians—the actions of the two men led to a debate on <a href="Historical%20immigration%20to%20Great%20Britain">immigration control</a>. In early February 1909 <a href="Herbert%20Gladstone%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Gladstone">Herbert Gladstone</a>, the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> defended the <a href="Liberal%20government%2C%201905%E2%80%931915">Asquith government</a>'s record on immigration, citing the number of foreign dissidents who had been expelled from Britain for criminal activity.

The popular press reported the case extensively, and some newspapers, particularly "<a href="Daily%20Mail">The Daily Mail</a>", focused on attacking the Aliens Act 1905, blaming it for being too open and making it too easy to enter the country. The French anarchist newspaper "" called Helfeld and Lepidus "our audacious comrades" who came "under attack" from what they called "citizens, believers in the State and authority". The perception of immigrants was affected by the outrage and, according to the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police Service</a>, it "provoked some misplaced public anti-Semitism", which affected public opinion two years later in the Siege of Sidney Street. In December 1909, during the events that led to the siege, a leading article in "The Times" described the Whitechapel area as one that:

harbours some of the worst alien anarchists and criminals who seek our too hospitable shore. And these are the men who use the pistol and the knife. The present affair inevitably recalls the extraordinary and fatal outrage which occurred at Tottenham less than two years ago.

Dudley Clarke

<a href="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> Dudley Wrangel Clarke ( – ) was an officer in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, known as a pioneer of <a href="military%20deception">military deception</a> operations during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. His ideas for combining fictional orders of battle, visual deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy during the war, for which he has been referred to as "the greatest British deceiver of WW2". Clarke was also instrumental in the founding of three famous military units, namely the <a href="British%20Commandos">British Commandos</a>, the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> and the <a href="US%20Rangers">US Rangers</a>.

Born in Johannesburg and brought up near London, Clarke joined the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> as an officer in 1916 but transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> after finding he was too young to fight in France. He spent the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> learning to fly, first in <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> and then Egypt. Clarke returned to the Royal Artillery in 1919 and had a varied career doing intelligence work in the Middle East. In 1936 he was posted to Palestine, where he helped organise the British repression of the <a href="1936%E2%80%931939%20Arab%20revolt%20in%20Palestine">1936 Arab uprising</a>. During the Second World War, Clarke joined <a href="John%20Dill">John Dill</a>'s staff and proposed and helped implement, an idea for commando raids into France – an early form of the British Commandos.

In 1940, <a href="Archibald%20Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a> called Clarke to Cairo and placed him in charge of strategic deception. As a cover, he was employed to set up a regional organisation for <a href="MI9">MI9</a>, a British escape and evasion department. The following year Clarke received a war establishment and set up <a href="Advanced%20Headquarters%20%27A%27%20Force">Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force</a> with a small staff to plan deception operations. Once satisfied with the department's structure, he pursued intelligence contacts in Turkey and Spain. In late 1941 Clarke was called to London, where his deception work had come to the attention of Allied high command. Shortly afterward, while in Madrid, he was arrested wearing women's clothing, in circumstances that remain unclear. He was released and after being questioned by the governor of Gibraltar, allowed to return to Cairo.

During Clarke's absence, deception hierarchy in <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a> had become muddled. Colonel Ralph Bagnold had taken over deception planning, pushing 'A' Force aside. Clarke was sent to <a href="El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a>, where Allied forces were on the retreat, to work on deception plans. Upon his return, Bagnold was sidelined and 'A' Force reinstated as the primary deception department. Throughout 1942 Clarke implemented <a href="Operation%20Cascade">Operation Cascade</a>, an <a href="order%20of%20battle">order of battle</a> deception which added many fictional units to the Allied formations. Cascade was a success; by the end of the war the enemy accepted most of the formations as real. From 1942 to 1945, Clarke continued to organise deception in North Africa and southern Europe. After the war, he was asked to record the history of 'A' Force. He retired in 1947 and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity. As well as pursuing a literary career that produced two histories and a <a href="thriller%20%28genre%29">thriller</a>, he worked for the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> and was a director of <a href="Securicor">Securicor</a>. He died in London in 1974.

Clarke was born in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> on . His father, Ernest Clarke, grew up in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Kingston upon Hull</a> and moved to South Africa in the late 19th century, where he became embroiled in the <a href="Jameson%20Raid">Jameson Raid</a>. Ernest managed to avoid prison for his part in the raid and, via a co-conspirator, obtained a job at a gold mining company. Once settled, Ernest married Madeline Gardiner, and a short while later, Dudley was born. During the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, the Clarke family was trapped in the <a href="siege%20of%20Ladysmith">siege of Ladysmith</a>. Although an infant at the time of the siege, Clarke later tried to claim a <a href="Queen%27s%20South%20Africa%20Medal">campaign medal</a>. Soon afterwards, the family returned to England, moving to <a href="Watford">Watford</a>, where Clarke's brother, the screenwriter <a href="T.%20E.%20B.%20Clarke">T. E. B. Clarke</a>, was born in 1907.

From an early age, Clarke wanted a career in the armed forces. In 1912, he attended <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a>, where he was exposed to the glamorous parties and smart uniforms of the nearby military presence at <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a>, including the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>.

Eager to be in active service, Clarke applied to sit the Army Entrance Exam in 1915, as soon as he had reached the minimum age of sixteen and a half. To his own surprise (he had petitioned the Charterhouse headmaster for a recommendation, allowing him to bypass the exam, on the expectation of failing), he passed and in early 1916 attended the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich">Royal Military Academy, Woolwich</a>. In November 1916, Clarke was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>. When his regiment deployed to France, Clarke had to stay behind because, aged 17, he was too young to fight. Frustrated, he applied to join the Royal Flying Corps and transferred to the <a href="No%201%20School%20of%20Military%20Aeronautics">School of Military Aeronautics</a> in Reading in . The following April he was posted to Egypt to complete his flight training, where he stayed until . Despite his promotion to the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a>, Clarke transferred back to the Royal Artillery on his return to England.

After the war, Clarke had a varied military career that began with a posting to <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> in 1919. During the <a href="Iraqi%20revolt%20against%20the%20British">Iraqi revolt of 1920</a>, he helped evacuate Europeans from the region by boat. While on extended leave in Turkey in 1922, he became involved in the <a href="Chanak%20Crisis">Chanak Crisis</a>, a threatened Turkish attack on British and French troops. Clarke volunteered to help the local British force and was tasked with feeding misinformation to Turkish nationalists – a first taste of the activities that would define his later military career. In 1925, during another period of leave, Clarke covered the <a href="Rif%20War">Rif War</a> for the "<a href="Morning%20Post">Morning Post</a>".

Over the inter-war period, Clarke became involved in the theatre and drama establishments of his postings. In 1923, he re-formed the "Royal Artillery Officers Dramatic Club" and was responsible for the Royal Artillery's display at the 1925 <a href="Royal%20Tournament">Royal Tournament</a>. In 1933 and 1934, he wrote and directed two Christmas <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>s.

In 1936, Clarke was posted, at his request, to <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, just in time to participate in the <a href="1936%E2%80%931939%20Arab%20revolt%20in%20Palestine">1936 Arab uprising</a>. The British presence in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was minimal at that time, comprising two regiments of infantry and a motley collection of air and armour under the command of . Clarke, as one of only two <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">staff officers</a>, was faced with organising an effective response to <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>. He first set to work improving communications between the small <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> contingent and the army. It was here that he met Tony Simonds, an intelligence officer sent to the region with express orders to set up an intelligence network. Clarke and Simonds worked to feed reliable information to British forces.

Toward the end of 1936, more troops were dispatched to Palestine. Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Dill">John Dill</a> was placed in command, and Clarke became his <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a>. In 1937, Dill was replaced by Major General <a href="Archibald%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a>, the commander who would later give Clarke free rein in Middle Eastern deception operations. In the preface to Clarke's 1948 book, "Seven Assignments", Wavell wrote about their time together in Palestine:

At the outbreak of the Second World War Clarke was promoted to lieutenant colonel and began working on intelligence tasks. He worked with Wavell in the Middle East to research possible Allied supply lines, undertook two trips to Norway (in an effort to maintain its neutrality), and conducted secret missions in Calais and Ireland.

In Clarke became a military assistant to General Sir John Dill (then <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>) at the War Office. On , inspired by childhood recollections of similar Boer forces as well as experiences during the Arab uprising in Palestine, Clarke sketched out an idea for small amphibious raiding parties, called Commandos. On , while Dill was inspecting the troops <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">evacuated from Dunkirk</a>, Clarke suggested the idea to him, and the prime minister approved the plan on the following day. Clarke, under Brigadier Otto Lunde, was tasked with setting up a new department, MO9, and began to recruit soldiers for what would later become the <a href="British%20Commandos">British Commandos</a>. The first raid into France, <a href="Operation%20Collar%20%28commando%20raid%29">Operation Collar</a>, took place on 24 June 1940. Clarke obtained permission to accompany the 120-strong force, but was not allowed to go ashore. The attempt was not a major success, with only one of the four units managing to kill enemy troops. While waiting on the beach for his men to return, Clarke's boat was apparently spotted by a German patrol. Somehow Clarke was injured in the ear during, he said, an exchange of fire. Ernest Chappell, who was also on the beach, said that the patrol had not opened fire.

In Cairo, Archibald Wavell, Clarke's old commander in Palestine, was commanding the North African campaign. He believed that deception was a key part of warfare. On 13 December he summoned Clarke to Egypt, telling high command he wished to set up "a special section of Intelligence for Deception". While awaiting Clarke's arrival, Wavell initiated a successful deception against the Italian forces at <a href="Sidi%20Barrani">Sidi Barrani</a>. Clarke reached Cairo on 18 December, to be greeted by Tony Simonds – another old hand from Palestine. Wavell put Clarke in charge, albeit under great secrecy, of broad strategic deception operations in North Africa. He held this position, under subsequent Mediterranean commanders, for the next five years.

On his arrival in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who operated Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of <a href="Italian%20Somaliland">Italian Somaliland</a> instead of <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: that the key to deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.

Clarke had not forgotten his previous pet scheme: the Commandos. In , he met the American Colonel <a href="William%20J.%20Donovan">William J. Donovan</a> while the latter was touring the region. Clarke's description of the 1940 British unit inspired Donovan to emulate the idea. Clarke suggested the name "Rangers", after the frontier force Rogers' Rangers in the film <a href="Northwest%20Passage%20%28film%29">"Northwest Passage"</a>, for Donovan's unit. In May of the following year the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Rangers">United States Army Rangers</a> were founded.

In February, Clarke suffered from an attack of <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a> that put him out of action for about six weeks. He was visited regularly by Maunsell who was, by that time, a firm friend.

At first Clarke worked alone and in secret, under the official title "Intelligence Officer (special duties) to the Commander-in-Chief". He had neither staff nor official mandate, and worked from a "converted bathroom" at the British Army headquarters, Cairo. His cover role was to establish a regional department for <a href="MI9">MI9</a>, the less secret organisation tasked with helping Allied servicemen in escape and evasion tactics. Far from being a token cover, Clarke ran MI9's Middle East department, in tandem with his deception work, until . Clarke's one-man show in deception was not to last long.

In Clarke began Operation Abeam, fabricating the existence of a British <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a> regiment in the region. It would be two years before such troops reached the Mediterranean, but Clarke hoped to play on Italian fears of an airborne assault. He created a fictional <a href="1st%20SAS%20Brigade">1st Special Air Service Brigade</a>, using faked documents, photographs and reports, which leaked back to the Italians. He even dressed two soldiers in "1 SAS" uniforms and set them to wander around Cairo, Port Said and Alexandria hinting at missions in <a href="Crete">Crete</a> or <a href="Libya">Libya</a>.

By March, Clarke had another scheme in the works, a deception cover for Operation Cordite, the <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">6th Infantry Division</a> invasion of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>. His work interviewing locals about the Greek island could not be associated with the 6th so he adopted the guise of 'A' Force. The name was intentionally vague, designed to add to the mythology of his fictional airborne unit. Although at first only a cover name, the department soon became real and took control of deception in the region. On Clarke requisitioned , Cairo – opposite and below a <a href="brothel">brothel</a> – and in April received an official mandate for his department. "Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force" moved into their new offices on and Clarke began to recruit his staff.

Clarke's airborne SAS had another legacy. In <a href="David%20Stirling">David Stirling</a>, an injured member of the early <a href="8%20Commando">8 Commando</a>, envisioned a new special forces unit consisting of small commando teams intended to operate behind enemy lines. Clarke gave the project his full backing, and the unit was named "L" Detachment, Special Air Service – in part to help solidify the existence of the larger fictional force in the minds of the enemy. Stirling's force later evolved into the modern-day <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a>. Clarke therefore had a hand in the formation of three famed military units.

Phantom forces, of which the SAS was only Clarke's first, played a crucial part in deception operations during the war – including along the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Western Front</a> in 1944 – but for the rest of he worked hard to build his department.

Clarke's "War Establishment" granted him three officers, several enlisted men and a small array of vehicles. A recruitment drive paid off in the form of highly experienced staff. To help with visual deception he brought in <a href="Victor%20Jones%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Victor Jones</a> and <a href="Jasper%20Maskelyne">Jasper Maskelyne</a>. He also recruited a Scots Guards officer, Captain Ogilvie-Grant, to manage the MI9 escape and evasion work, which had been adopted as cover for the whole of 'A' Force. Finally, the services of Major E. Titterington, originally a member of Maunsell's SIME, were obtained for help in creating forged documents; eventually Titterington's operation expanded to form a subsection of 'A' Force devoted to forgeries.

With his office organised, Clarke was happy to leave day-to-day management to his staff. He then embarked on a trip to Turkey, where he worked to establish a network of misinformation as well as carry out his MI9 role. There he met two important figures in Turkish intelligence – Brigadier <a href="Allan%20Arnold">Allan Arnold</a>, the British <a href="military%20attach%C3%A9">military attaché</a>, and Commander Vladimir Wolfson, a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> attaché – and worked with them to open channels of misinformation to the enemy. In Wolfson, Clarke had found an important resource and, in his own words, began "a long and profitable partnership for Deception and MI9 matters in Turkey which was to last for the rest of the war". Clarke left <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> on , travelling covertly back to Egypt via <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> in order to reconnoitre the ground that British forces would have to invade when entering the country. He arrived in Cairo on .

Despite Clarke and Wavell's successes in deception, the North African campaign was turning against the Allies. In 1941 <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> had taken command of Axis forces and won early victories. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Churchill</a> replaced Wavell with <a href="Claude%20Auchinleck">Claude Auchinleck</a>. Clarke's new commander was impressed with Wavell's setup, so 'A' Force and the rest of Middle Eastern Command continued to operate as before.

Clarke travelled to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> on aiming, as with his earlier Turkey trip, to open up lines of deception into Axis forces. He spent around a month in the area, posing as a flamboyant journalist, before being summoned back to London. His successful deception activities in the Middle East had caught the attention of high command, and Clarke was asked to write a paper about his experiences.

While in London, Clarke met many of his counterparts on the Western Front. He attended meetings of the <a href="Double-Cross%20System">Twenty Committee</a> and <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> (which was chaired by his old commander, John Dill). The paper on deception met with approval in the establishment and it was decided that a department similar to 'A' Force should be created in London. Clarke was offered the job, reporting directly to the Chiefs of Staff and <a href="War%20Cabinet%23United%20Kingdom">War Cabinet</a>. He declined, citing loyalty to the Middle East, but his decision was in large part due to the greater operational freedom and status he enjoyed in North Africa. The <a href="London%20Controlling%20Section">London Controlling Section</a> was formed and, after some disorganisation, prospered under <a href="John%20Bevan%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Bevan</a>, with whom Clarke would later work closely.

Pleased with his success in London, Clarke returned to Lisbon on posing as a journalist for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" named "Wrangal Craker". His aim was to carry on the semi-undercover work of spreading rumours and misinformation to the Germans. Later that month, in Madrid, he was arrested while dressed as a woman. <a href="Guy%20Liddell">Guy Liddell</a>, wartime counter-espionage head at <a href="MI5">MI5</a>, said of the incident: "I'm afraid to say that after his stay in Lisbon as a bogus journalist he has got rather over-confident about his powers as an agent." Clarke was released, apparently at the behest of a German contact who believed him to be "an important agent who was ready to assist the Germans", and made his way to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>.

Clarke's run of bad luck continued. He was ordered back to London to explain the Madrid incident to his superiors but, after setting out on the ship "Ariosto", the convoy was <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>ed by a <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> on . The "Ariosto" was one of three ships sunk in the engagement, although he escaped harm and returned to Gibraltar. Rather than attempting another trip to London, Clarke was interviewed by the Governor of Gibraltar, <a href="John%20Vereker%2C%206th%20Viscount%20Gort">Lord Gort</a>, who judged Clarke's answers acceptable and concluded that "we can reasonably expect that this escapade and its consequences will have given him sufficient shock to make him more prudent in the immediate future". It is unclear why Clarke was wearing a dress, but reports of the incident indicated he had been following a lead and gone a little too far in his spy-craft. Photographs of his disguise, obtained from the Spanish police, circulated in London and were viewed mostly with amusement. He was allowed to return to Cairo and reached Egypt on . Although he escaped disciplinary action over the incident, it was the last time Clarke attempted his own espionage work.

Back in Cairo, Clarke discovered that much had changed during his absence. The recently promoted Colonel <a href="Ralph%20Bagnold">Ralph Bagnold</a> had been appointed "Chief Deception Officer" at Middle Eastern HQ and had taken charge of tactical deception. Clarke was annoyed at what he saw as a power grab and at the sudden high profile of deception operations (Bagnold's promotion was widely publicised). Over the next few months Bagnold secured more and more of the day-to-day management of deception operations leaving 'A' Force, and Clarke, in a training and advisory capacity.

Despite this, Clarke's services were in high demand as the opening months of 1942 saw Allied forces in North Africa suffering serious defeats. On Auchinleck dispatched Clarke to Libya with urgent orders to assist in halting the German advances. Before leaving for the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a> headquarters in <a href="Gazala">Gazala</a>, Clarke left a note, which he later described as "begging for the whole question of deception machinery in the Command to be reviewed completely afresh during his absence." Once on the ground he found a shaken army conducting a hesitant withdrawal, and in urgent need of delaying tactics to slow the German advance. After brainstorming with his team in Cairo, Clarke envisioned Bastion, a deception operation to convince Rommel that his advance on Gazala was heading into a trap. The plan, which involved Victor Jones creating a strong fictional force of 300 tanks on the British right hand flank, was in full swing during February. The operation appears to have had limited effect. Rommel delayed his advance until May, when British forces were routed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">Battle of Gazala</a> and the Germans resumed their push toward Egypt.

Upon his return to Cairo, on , Clarke was pleased to find that Auchinleck had restored 'A' Force as the sole deception organisation at HQ. Bagnold's enterprise was entirely sidelined and he moved on to other things. Clarke, who in March was promoted to full colonel, said that Bastion had taught him much: "We learnt more "Lessons" from it than from almost any other plan and it helped us evolve three important principles." By the end of March, Clarke considered the much-expanded 'A' Force, and his theory of deception, to have matured beyond the basic trial and error of the previous years.

In Clarke had begun to draft ideas for an ambitious <a href="order%20of%20battle">order-of-battle</a> deception. He had found that the process of convincing the enemy of the existence of a notional force was long and tedious. Operation Cascade was intended to create the fiction of a much increased Allied force in North Africa, including eight <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a>, three new <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s, and even the 1st SAS. At first the plan was intended to deter the Axis from extending an offensive against the <a href="USSR">USSR</a> southward into the region.

After a slow start, in early 1942, Cascade began to take effect. As early as May, Axis intelligence began to overestimate Allied strength by nearly 30%. In July the operation expanded. Clarke introduced more and more fictitious divisions and by the end of the year the Germans had accepted many of them as real formations. By 1944, when the operation was superseded, it had completely fooled the enemy. Cascade was a major success for Clarke; it supported most of the subsequent major deceptions for the remainder of the war (by providing established fictional units) and proved that deception on a grand scale was a realistic strategy.

In May, before Cascade had become fully operational, Rommel defeated the British Army in Libya. Auchinleck rallied his forces at <a href="El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a> and asked Clarke to draft plans for delaying the Axis advance, giving the Allies time to withdraw. Operation Sentinel was designed to convince Rommel, using camouflage, fakery and radio deception, that substantial British <a href="Division%20%28military%29%23Armored%20division">armour</a> sat between him and the retreating Eighth Army. In spite of his <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">success at El Alamein</a> Auchinleck was replaced by <a href="Harold%20Alexander">Harold Alexander</a> on , Clarke's third commander in under two years. <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a> was handed control of the Eighth Army and instructed to push Rommel back. Montgomery knew Clarke, having taught him infantry tactics at the Staff College in 1931, and instructed him to prepare deception plans for the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>. The plan involved major camouflage activity, <a href="Operation%20Bertram">Operation Bertram</a>, radio deception, Operation Canwell and a disinformation campaign, Operation Treatment. On 9 September Clarke was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE). The citation recognised his efforts in setting up A-Force, but referred to its less clandestine MI9 escape and evasion work.

Clarke had his mind on other things besides awards and El Alamein. He delegated much of the ongoing planning to 'A' Force staff, as the department was now well established. Instead he flew to London and Washington in October to discuss strategic deception for <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>, the forthcoming British-American invasion of the French North African colonies, leaving <a href="Charles%20Leslie%20Richardson">Charles Richardson</a> (a planning officer at Eight Army HQ) and <a href="Geoffrey%20Barkas">Geoffrey Barkas</a> (Director of Camouflage, Middle East Command) to implement Operation Bertram. For the first time deception experts from across the theatres of war worked together. John Bevan of the London Controlling Section hosted an October conference for Clarke, Peter Flemming from India, and representatives from Washington. The meeting agreed on plans for a disinformation campaign, which would attempt to convince German high command that the Allied targets in Africa were Dakar and Sicily (the far eastern and western limits of the theatre). Four days after Montgomery's success at El Alamein, on , Allied forces landed in Morocco and Algeria to the surprise of German forces there. On Clarke, along with Bevan and Flemming, met Churchill to discuss all the Allied deception strategies.

1943 would be the peak of deception operations for Clarke and 'A' Force – in 1944 the focus switched to the Western Front. Until then he was very busy between Operation Barclay and the continuing Cascade. The main Allied push that year was toward <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, as decided by high command in January. Barclay was the elaborate deception with which Clarke was tasked, an operation to mislead the Axis into expecting attacks on the far eastern and western extremities of the northern Mediterranean theatre – namely the <a href="Balkan%20Peninsula">Balkan Peninsula</a> and southern France.

On Clarke again met Bevan, in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, to discuss strategy for Barclay. Building on Cascade he added the <a href="Twelfth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Twelfth Army</a> to his fictional order of battle, and began to make them look like a convincing threat to Crete and the Greek mainland. For this new deception 'A' Force had strong support from London – in April the famed <a href="Operation%20Mincemeat">Operation Mincemeat</a> was used to help bolster Clarke's deceptive thrust toward Crete.

By this point 'A' Force had much expanded beyond the small flat in Cairo, adding representatives with the army in Sicily and offices in Algiers and Nairobi. Clarke roved around the region acting as overseer of the department's operations. On 14 October he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), the citation (marked "not for publication") praised Clarke's ongoing work, referring to him as "irreplaceable". In December 1943, he was promoted to the
rank of brigadier. Although the promotion did not include perks associated with higher ranks (such as a car and driver) Clarke used his charisma to obtain them anyway.

In 1944 the Allies finally focused on France and the Western Front. Bevan and the London Controlling Section were tasked with inventing an elaborate masquerade to cover the Normandy invasion, a vindication of the theory pioneered by Clarke and Wavell: that every real operation should have a complementary deception.

The focus on France left Clarke supporting the Allied push through Italy. He noted that "the peculiar circumstances of the Mediterranean Theater made it a sheer impossibility to have a hiatus of more than a week or two duration between Deception Plans." In quick succession 'A' Force executed deceptions that included the operations Oakenfield and <a href="Operation%20Zeppelin%20%28Allies%29">Zeppelin</a>. Later that spring Clarke was inspired by a war film, "<a href="Five%20Graves%20to%20Cairo">Five Graves to Cairo</a>", to create <a href="Operation%20Copperhead">Operation Copperhead</a>. Bernard Montgomery had recently been moved to England to take command of the ground forces intended for the Normandy invasion. To confuse the Germans, Clarke located a <a href="look-alike">look-alike</a>, pre-war actor Lieutenant <a href="M.%20E.%20Clifton%20James">M. E. Clifton James</a>, and brought him to the Mediterranean under much ceremony.

Through 1944 'A' Force was slowly winding down. Clarke was involved in planning <a href="Operation%20Bodyguard">Operation Bodyguard</a>, a major cover plan for the Allied landing in Normandy, and he was tasked with executing the (largely political) deceptions in the Middle Eastern region. However, by the end of the summer 'A' Force's usefulness in operations had reached its end. On 13 October Clarke held a party (true to form, at a Cairo cinema) for the remaining members of the department. Command of the remaining tactical deceptions was transferred to <a href="Caserta">Caserta</a>. Clarke, along with a skeleton staff, remained in Egypt to tie up the loose ends of various operations and to begin his history of the department. In April 1945, Clarke left Cairo for London; on 18 June he called a meeting of the remaining 'A' Force members at the <a href="Great%20Central%20Hotel">Great Central Hotel</a> where the department was disbanded.

Clarke was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> on 19 October 1944, relating to his work setting up 'A' Force.

The citation was announced in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>" on 22 February 1945. Clarke received a further honour that year, when on 19 June he was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB). On 2 April 1946 he was awarded the American <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>.

Following the end of the war Clarke spent some time writing war histories. Until his retirement from the army in 1947, with the rank of brigadier, he recorded the history of 'A' Force. The document was never published and remained classified till the 1970s. His first complete book was published in 1948. "Seven Assignments" recorded Clarke's activities during the early wartime period of 1939 and 1940 (before the Middle East posting). It was not his first attempt at a book. In 1925 Clarke had found a publisher for his coverage for the Rif rebellion, but the work was never finished.

Following "Seven Assignments" Clarke then took a job at Conservative Central Office, as Head of Public Opinion Research, where he worked until 1952. During this later career he also served as a director of <a href="Securicor">Securicor</a>. In 1952 he resumed his literary career with the publication of "The Eleventh at War", a history of the <a href="11th%20Hussars">11th Hussars</a>. The following year he submitted a publisher's proposal for "The Secret War", a full account of deception during the Second World War, but was prevented from writing it by the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act">Official Secrets Act</a>. His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled "Golden Arrow", published in 1955.

Clarke lived out his retirement in relative obscurity, despite the belief of his former commander, Field Marshal Harold Alexander, that "he did as much to win the war as any other single officer". Clarke died on , his address at the time was an apartment in Raleigh House, <a href="Dolphin%20Square">Dolphin Square</a>, London. Most of his war work in military deception remained an obscure secret until the end of the 20th century and the publication of <a href="Michael%20Howard%20%28historian%29">Michael Howard</a>'s 1990 official history, "Strategic Deception in the Second World War".

Clarke was widely regarded as an expert in military deception, and viewed by some of his peers as nearly legendary in status. In his 2004 book, "", historian Thaddeus Holt identifies Clarke as "the master of the game", having been immersed in his deception activities for the entire war. Clarke evolved deception, almost from scratch, as a vital part of Allied strategy. The organisation that he and Wavell established proved a model for the other theatres of war, and his successes directly led to the creation of the London Controlling Section in 1941. He also misled German intelligence for several years – to the extent that they overestimated Allied strength in North Africa by a quarter of a million men. The journalist <a href="Nicholas%20Rankin">Nicholas Rankin</a>, writing in 2008, referred to Clarke as "the greatest British deceiver of WW2, a special kind of secret servant."

From the start of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of deception by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-<a href="shell%20%28projectile%29">shell</a> which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.

At the <a href="Tehran%20Conference">Tehran Conference</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> made his famous remark that in wartime 'truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.’ Clarke's principle was the opposite. His thesis was that the lie (the cover plan) was so precious that it should be flanked with an escort of truths.

Clarke also had a good appreciation of the complex interplay between Operations and intelligence in deception operations. He understood how to manipulate enemy intelligence agencies to build up the story he was trying to sell, and saw the importance of getting Operations, on his own side, to fit into those stories.

Clarke is described as a charismatic, charming and theatrical character with a streak of creativity, a personality reflected in the escapades of his life and career. His self-deprecating humour and work ethic made Clarke a popular figure within the army, where he was considered to have odd "old world" habits and "an uncanny habit of suddenly appearing in a room without anyone having noticed him enter". Clarke was considered to possess an "original intellect", and to have odd habits, but was never seen as eccentric (a trait that was frowned on within the army establishment). Despite having middle-class origins, he aspired to the fringes of the upper-class establishment, in his words: "one of those in the inner circle, watching the wheels go round at the hub of the British Empire at some great moment in history."
From his time in Egypt during the First World War, Clarke fell in love with the country and he returned there as often as possible. He had a great respect for the inhabitants, writing that they had "the endearing qualities of humour and fortitude". Another particular love was film. In Cairo, during the Second World War, he was a regular at the cinema, a location that suited his photographic memory and preference for working at night; he often conducted meetings there. Films influenced his work in other ways, for instance in the inspiration he took from "Northwest Passage" to name the US Rangers.

Clarke was inventive as well as frugal. While at flight school in Reading, and without any money to fund his recreation, he built "an apparatus composed of a bootlace, a lanyard and some straps off my valise, by which I am enabled to turn out the light without getting out of bed".

The incident in Madrid, and Clarke's love of theatrics, raised awkward questions about his sexuality. His arrest was somewhat hushed up at the time, which may have raised more questions than it prevented. There is no indication that Clarke was homosexual. He was involved in two bad relationships with women. In 1922 he met a Slavic woman called Nina in <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a>, but she disappeared after Clarke smuggled currency to her friend in Bulgaria. Then in the late 1920s a woman in Sussex, who "meant everything in the world" to him, refused an offer of marriage. He often claimed to hate children and never married. Despite this Clarke was known for having beautiful female acquaintances, to whom his friends referred as "Dudley's Duchesses".

Hanged, drawn and quartered

To be hanged, drawn and quartered was <a href="Treason%20Act%201351">from 1352</a> a <a href="statutory">statutory</a> penalty in England for men convicted of <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a>, although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">King Henry III</a> (1216–1272). A convicted traitor was fastened to a <a href="hurdle">hurdle</a>, or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then <a href="hanged">hanged</a> (almost to the point of death), <a href="emasculation">emasculated</a>, <a href="disembowelment">disembowelled</a>, <a href="decapitation">beheaded</a>, and <a href="Dismemberment">quartered</a> (chopped into four pieces). The traitor's remains were often displayed in prominent places across the country, such as <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a>. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead <a href="Burning%20of%20women%20in%20England">burned at the stake</a>.

The severity of the sentence was <a href="Retributive%20justice">measured against the seriousness of the crime</a>. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> priests executed during the <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan era</a>, and several of the <a href="List%20of%20regicides%20of%20Charles%20I">regicides</a> involved in the 1649 <a href="execution%20of%20Charles%20I">execution of Charles I</a>.

Although the <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England <a href="Forfeiture%20Act%201870">in 1870</a>. The death penalty for treason was abolished <a href="Crime%20and%20Disorder%20Act%201998">in 1998</a>.

During the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a> those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the 13th century other, more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering. The 13th-century English chronicler <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a> described how in 1238 "a certain man at arms, a man of some education ("armiger literatus")" attempted to kill <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">King Henry III</a>. His account records in gruesome detail how the would-be assassin was executed: "dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards hung on a gibbet used for robbers." He was apparently sent by <a href="William%20de%20Marisco">William de Marisco</a>, an outlaw who some years earlier had killed a man under royal protection before fleeing to <a href="Lundy%20Island">Lundy Island</a>. De Marisco was captured in 1242 and on Henry's order dragged from Westminster to the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> to be executed. There he was hanged from a <a href="gibbet">gibbet</a> until dead. His corpse was disembowelled, his entrails burned, his body quartered and the parts distributed to cities across the country. The punishment is more frequently recorded during <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a>'s reign. 

The <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> Prince <a href="Dafydd%20ap%20Gruffydd">Dafydd ap Gruffydd</a> became the first nobleman in England and Wales to be hanged, drawn, and quartered after he turned against the king and proclaimed himself <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> and Lord of Snowdon. Dafydd's rebellion infuriated Edward so much that he demanded a novel punishment. Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution. For killing English nobles he was hanged alive. For killing those nobles at Easter he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. For conspiring to kill the king in various parts of the realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. A similar fate was suffered by the <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> leader <a href="William%20Wallace">Sir William Wallace</a>. Captured and tried in 1305, he was forced to wear a crown of laurel leaves and was drawn to <a href="Smithfield%2C%20London">Smithfield</a>, where he was hanged and beheaded. His entrails were then burned and his corpse quartered. His head was set on <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a> and the quarters sent to <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>, <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick</a>, <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>, and <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>.
These and other executions, such as those of <a href="Andrew%20Harclay%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Carlisle">Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle</a>, and <a href="Hugh%20Despenser%20the%20Younger">Hugh Despenser the Younger</a>, which each occurred during <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">King Edward II</a>'s reign, happened when acts of <a href="treason">treason</a> in England, and their punishments, were not clearly defined in <a href="common%20law">common law</a>. Treason was based on an allegiance to the sovereign from all subjects aged 14 or over and it remained for the king and his judges to determine whether that allegiance had been broken. <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>'s justices had offered somewhat over-zealous interpretations of what activities constituted treason, "calling felonies treasons and afforcing indictments by talk of accroachment of the royal power", prompting parliamentary demands to clarify the law. Edward therefore introduced the <a href="Treason%20Act%201351">Treason Act 1351</a>. It was enacted at a time in English history when a monarch's right to rule was indisputable and was therefore written principally to protect the throne and sovereign. The new law offered a narrower definition of treason than had existed before and split the old feudal offence into two classes. <a href="Petty%20treason">Petty treason</a> referred to the killing of a master (or lord) by his servant, a husband by his wife, or a prelate by his clergyman. Men guilty of petty treason were drawn and hanged, whereas women were <a href="Burning%20of%20women%20in%20England">burned</a>.

<a href="High%20treason%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">High treason</a> was the most egregious offence an individual could commit. Attempts to undermine the king's authority were viewed with as much seriousness as if the accused had attacked him personally, which itself would be an assault on his status as sovereign and a direct threat to his right to govern. As this might undermine the state, retribution was considered an absolute necessity and the crime deserving of the ultimate punishment. The practical difference between the two offences therefore was in the consequence of being convicted; rather than being drawn and hanged, men were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, while for reasons of public decency (their anatomy being considered inappropriate for the sentence), women were instead drawn and burned. The Act declared that a person had committed high treason if they were: compassing or imagining the death of the king, his wife or his eldest son and heir; violating the king's wife, his eldest daughter if she were unmarried, or the wife of his eldest son and heir; levying war against the king in his <a href="realm">realm</a>; adhering to the king's enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in his realm or elsewhere; counterfeiting the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Great Seal</a> or the <a href="Privy%20Seal">Privy Seal</a>, or the king's coinage; knowingly importing counterfeit money; killing the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Chancellor</a>, <a href="Lord%20High%20Treasurer">Treasurer</a> or one of the king's Justices while performing their offices. The Act did not limit the king's authority in defining the scope of treason. It contained a proviso giving English judges discretion to extend that scope whenever required, a process more commonly known as <a href="constructive%20treason">constructive treason</a>. It also applied to subjects overseas in <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">British colonies in the Americas</a>, but the only documented incident of an individual there being hanged, drawn, and quartered was that of Joshua Tefft, an English colonist accused of having fought on the side of the <a href="Narragansett%20people">Narragansett</a> during the <a href="Great%20Swamp%20Fight">Great Swamp Fight</a>. He was executed in January 1676. Later sentences resulted either in a pardon or a hanging.

Only one witness was required to convict a person of treason, although in 1547 this was increased to two. Suspects were first questioned in private by the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> before they were publicly tried. They were allowed no witnesses or defence <a href="counsel">counsel</a>, and were generally presumed guilty from the outset. This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> politicians prompted the introduction of the <a href="Treason%20Act%201695">Treason Act 1695</a>. This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.

<a href="Edward%20Stafford%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham</a> was executed on 17 May 1521 for the crime of treason. The wording of his sentence has survived and indicates the precision with which the method of execution was described; he was to be "laid on a hurdle and so drawn to the place of execution, and there to be hanged, cut down alive, your members to be cut off and cast in the fire, your bowels burnt before you, your head smitten off, and your body quartered and divided at the King's will, and God have mercy on your soul."

Once sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution. During the early Middle Ages this journey may have been made tied directly to the back of a horse, but it subsequently became customary for the victim to be fastened instead to a wicker <a href="hurdle">hurdle</a>, or wooden panel, itself tied to the horse. Historian <a href="Frederic%20William%20Maitland">Frederic William Maitland</a> thought that this was probably to "[secure] for the hangman a yet living body". The use of the word drawn, as in "to draw", has caused a degree of confusion. One of the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary's</a>" definitions of draw is "to draw out the viscera or intestines of; to disembowel (a fowl, etc. before cooking, a traitor or other criminal after hanging)", but this is followed by "in many cases of executions it is uncertain whether this, or [to drag (a criminal) at a horse's tail, or on a hurdle or the like, to the place of execution; formerly a legal punishment of high treason], is meant. The presumption is that where "drawn" is mentioned after "hanged", the sense is as here." Historian <a href="Ram%20Sharan%20Sharma">Ram Sharan Sharma</a> arrived at the same conclusion: "Where, as in the popular "hung, drawn and quartered" [use] (meaning facetiously, of a person, completely disposed of), "drawn" follows "hanged" or "hung", it is to be referred to as the disembowelling of the traitor." Sharma is not the only historian to support this viewpoint as the phrase, "hanged until dead before being drawn and quartered", occurs in a number of relevant secondary publications The historian and author <a href="Ian%20Mortimer%20%28historian%29">Ian Mortimer</a> disagrees. In an essay published on his website, he writes that the separate mention of evisceration is a relatively modern device, and that while it certainly took place on many occasions, the presumption that "drawing" means to disembowel is spurious. Instead, drawing (as a method of transportation) may be mentioned after hanging because it was a supplementary part of the execution.

Some reports indicate that during <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Queen Mary I</a>'s reign bystanders were vocal in their support: while in transit convicts sometimes suffered directly at the hands of the crowd. <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a> was whipped, attacked and had rotten food and waste thrown at him, and the priest <a href="Thomas%20Pilchard">Thomas Pilchard</a> was reportedly barely alive by the time he reached the gallows in 1587. Others found themselves admonished by "zealous and godly men"; it became customary for a preacher to follow the condemned, asking them to repent. According to <a href="Samuel%20Clarke">Samuel Clarke</a>, the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> clergyman <a href="William%20Perkins%20%28Puritan%29">William Perkins</a> (1558–1602) once managed to convince a young man at the gallows that he had been forgiven, enabling the youth to go to his death "with tears of joy in his eyes ... as if he actually saw himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and heaven opened for receiving his soul."

After the king's commission had been read aloud, the crowd was normally asked to move back from the scaffold before being addressed by the convict. While these speeches were mostly an admission of guilt (although few admitted treason), still they were carefully monitored by the sheriff and chaplain, who were occasionally forced to act; in 1588, Catholic priest <a href="William%20Dean%20%28priest%29">William Dean</a>'s address to the crowd was considered so inappropriate that he was gagged almost to the point of suffocation. Questions on matters of allegiance and politics were sometimes put to the prisoner, as happened to <a href="Edmund%20Gennings">Edmund Gennings</a> in 1591. He was asked by <a href="priest%20hunter">priest hunter</a> <a href="Richard%20Topcliffe">Richard Topcliffe</a> to "confess his treason", but when Gennings responded "if to say Mass be treason, I confess to have done it and glory in it", Topcliffe ordered him to be quiet and instructed the hangman to push him off the ladder. Sometimes the witness responsible for the condemned man's execution was also present. A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of <a href="Thomas%20Ford%20%28martyr%29">Thomas Ford</a>. Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence. The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.

The condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. The priest <a href="James%20Bell%20%28priest%29">James Bell</a> was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, <a href="John%20Finch%20%28martyr%29">John Finch</a>, was "a-quarter-inge". <a href="Edward%20James%20%28martyr%29">Edward James</a> and Francis Edwardes were made to witness <a href="Ralph%20Crockett">Ralph Crockett</a>'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed. Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart. On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air. The aim was usually to cause <a href="strangulation">strangulation</a> and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest <a href="John%20Payne%20%28martyr%29">John Payne</a>'s death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs. Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular <a href="William%20Hacket">William Hacket</a> (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally <a href="emasculated">emasculated</a>—the latter, according to Sir <a href="Edward%20Coke">Edward Coke</a>, to "show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood.".
A victim still conscious at that point might have seen his entrails burned, before his heart was removed and the body decapitated and quartered (chopped into four pieces). The <a href="List%20of%20regicides%20of%20Charles%20I">regicide</a> <a href="Thomas%20Harrison%20%28soldier%29">Major-General Thomas Harrison</a>, after being hanged for several minutes and then cut open in October 1660, was reported to have leaned across and hit his executioner—resulting in the swift removal of his head. His entrails were thrown onto a nearby fire. <a href="John%20Houghton%20%28martyr%29">John Houghton</a> was reported to have prayed while being disembowelled in 1535, and in his final moments to have cried "Good Jesu, what will you do with my heart?" Executioners were often inexperienced and proceedings did not always run smoothly. In 1584 <a href="Richard%20Gwyn%20%28martyr%29">Richard White</a>'s executioner removed his bowels piece by piece, through a small hole in his belly, "the which device taking no good success, he mangled his breast with a butcher's axe to the very chine most pitifully." At his execution in January 1606 for his involvement in the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>, <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a> managed to break his neck by jumping from the gallows, cheating the executioner.
No records exist to demonstrate exactly how the corpse was quartered, although an engraving of the quartering of <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Armstrong">Sir Thomas Armstrong</a> in 1684 shows the executioner making vertical cuts through the spine and removing the legs at the hip. The distribution of <a href="Dafydd%20ap%20Gruffydd">Dafydd ap Gruffydd</a>'s remains was described by <a href="Sir%20Herbert%20Maxwell%2C%207th%20Baronet">Herbert Maxwell</a>: "the right arm with a ring on the finger in York; the left arm in Bristol; the right leg and hip at Northampton; the left [leg] at Hereford. But the villain's head was bound with iron, lest it should fall to pieces from putrefaction, and set conspicuously upon a long spear-shaft for the mockery of London." After the execution in 1660 of several of the regicides involved in the death of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles I</a> eleven years earlier, the diarist <a href="John%20Evelyn">John Evelyn</a> remarked: "I saw not their execution, but met their quarters, mangled, and cut, and reeking, as they were brought from the gallows in baskets on the hurdle." Such remains were typically <a href="parboiled">parboiled</a> and displayed as a gruesome reminder of the penalty for high treason, usually wherever the traitor had conspired or found support. Salt and <a href="cumin">cumin</a> seed would be added during the boiling process: the salt to prevent putrefaction, and the cumin seed to prevent birds pecking at the flesh.

The head was often displayed on <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a>, for centuries the route by which many travellers from the south entered the city. Several eminent commentators remarked on the displays. In 1566 <a href="Joseph%20Justus%20Scaliger">Joseph Justus Scaliger</a> wrote that "in London there were many heads on the bridge ... I have seen there, as if they were masts of ships, and at the top of them, quarters of men's corpses." In 1602 the <a href="Barnim%20X%2C%20Duke%20of%20Pomerania">Duke of Pommerania-Stettin</a> emphasised the ominous nature of their presence when he wrote "near the end of the bridge, on the suburb side, were stuck up the heads of thirty gentlemen of high standing who had been beheaded on account of treason and secret practices against the Queen." The practice of using London Bridge in this manner ended following the hanging, drawing, and quartering in 1678 of William Staley, a victim of the fictitious <a href="Popish%20Plot">Popish Plot</a>. His quarters were given to his relatives, who promptly arranged a "grand" funeral; this incensed the coroner so much that he ordered the body to be dug up and set upon the city gates. Staley's was the last head to be placed on London Bridge.

Another victim of the Popish Plot, <a href="Oliver%20Plunkett">Oliver Plunkett</a> the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Armagh">Archbishop of Armagh</a>, was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn in July 1681. His executioner was bribed so that Plunket's body parts were saved from the fire; the head is now displayed at <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%2C%20Drogheda">St Peter's Church in Drogheda</a>. <a href="Francis%20Towneley">Francis Towneley</a> and several other captured <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> officers involved in the <a href="Jacobite%20Rising%20of%201745">Jacobite Rising of 1745</a> were executed, but by then the executioner possessed some discretion as to how much they should suffer and thus they were killed before their bodies were eviscerated. The French spy <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Henri%20de%20la%20Motte">François Henri de la Motte</a> was hanged in 1781 for almost an hour before his heart was cut out and burned, and the following year David Tyrie was hanged, decapitated, and then quartered at Portsmouth. Pieces of his corpse were fought over by members of the 20,000-strong crowd there, some making trophies of his limbs and fingers. In 1803 <a href="Edward%20Despard">Edward Despard</a> and six co-conspirators in the <a href="Despard%20Plot">Despard Plot</a> were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. Before they were hanged and beheaded at <a href="Horsemonger%20Lane%20Gaol">Horsemonger Lane Gaol</a>, they were first placed on sledges attached to horses, and ritually pulled in circuits around the gaol yards. Their execution was attended by an audience of about 20,000. A contemporary report describes the scene after Despard had made his speech:

At the burnings of Isabella Condon in 1779 and Phoebe Harris in 1786, the sheriffs present inflated their expenses; in the opinion of Simon Devereaux they were probably dismayed at being forced to attend such spectacles. Harris's fate prompted <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a> to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice, but as one of its proposals would have allowed the <a href="Body%20snatching">anatomical dissection</a> of criminals other than murderers, the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> rejected it. The burning in 1789 of <a href="Catherine%20Murphy%20%28counterfeiter%29">Catherine Murphy</a>, a counterfeiter, was impugned in Parliament by Sir Benjamin Hammett. He called it one of "the savage remains of Norman policy". Amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the <a href="Treason%20Act%201790">Treason Act 1790</a>, which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning. It was followed by the <a href="Treason%20Act%201814">Treason Act 1814</a>, introduced by <a href="Samuel%20Romilly">Samuel Romilly</a>, a legal reformer. Influenced by his friend, <a href="Jeremy%20Bentham">Jeremy Bentham</a>, Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the <a href="Bloody%20Code">severity of England's laws</a> was responsible for an increase in crime. When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as "Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood". He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy, and <a href="Treason%20Act%201814">in 1814</a> proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal. However, when it was pointed out that this would be a less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decapitated, "as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma." This is what happened to <a href="Jeremiah%20Brandreth">Jeremiah Brandreth</a>, leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the <a href="Pentrich%20rising">Pentrich rising</a> and one of three men executed in 1817 at <a href="Derby%20Gaol">Derby Gaol</a>. As with Edward Despard and his confederates the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince Regent</a> were beheaded with an axe. The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the <a href="Cato%20Street%20Conspiracy">Cato Street Conspiracy</a> were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls. The plot was the last crime for which the sentence was applied.

Reformation of England's capital punishment laws continued throughout the 19th century, as politicians such as <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Russell">John Russell, 1st Earl Russell</a>, sought to remove from the statute books many of the capital offences that remained. <a href="Robert%20Peel">Robert Peel</a>'s drive to ameliorate law enforcement saw petty treason abolished by the <a href="Offences%20against%20the%20Person%20Act%201828">Offences against the Person Act 1828</a>, which removed the distinction between crimes formerly considered as petty treason, and murder. The <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Capital%20Punishment%201864-1866">Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864-1866</a> recommended that there be no change to treason law, quoting the "more merciful" <a href="Treason%20Felony%20Act%201848">Treason Felony Act 1848</a>, which limited the punishment for most treasonous acts to <a href="penal%20servitude">penal servitude</a>. Its report recommended that for "rebellion, assassination or other violence ...we are of opinion that the extreme penalty must remain", although the most recent occasion (and ultimately, the last) on which anyone had been sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered was in November 1839, following the <a href="Chartism">Chartist</a> <a href="Newport%20Rising">Newport Rising</a>—and those men sentenced to death were instead <a href="penal%20transportation">transported</a>. The report highlighted the changing public mood toward public executions (brought about in part by the growing prosperity created by the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>). <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="Spencer%20Horatio%20Walpole">Spencer Horatio Walpole</a> told the commission that executions had "become so demoralizing that, instead of its having a good effect, it has a tendency rather to brutalize the public mind than to deter the criminal class from committing crime". The commission recommended that executions should be performed privately, behind prison walls and away from the public's view, "under such regulations as may be considered necessary to prevent abuse, and to satisfy the public that the law has been complied with." The practice of executing murderers in public was ended two years later by the <a href="Capital%20Punishment%20Amendment%20Act%201868">Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868</a>, introduced by Home Secretary <a href="Gathorne%20Hardy">Gathorne Hardy</a>, but this did not apply to traitors. An amendment to abolish capital punishment completely, suggested before the bill's third reading, failed by 127 votes to 23.

Hanging, drawing, and quartering was abolished in England by the <a href="Forfeiture%20Act%201870">Forfeiture Act 1870</a>, Liberal politician <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Forster%2C%201st%20Baronet">Charles Forster</a>'s second attempt since 1864 to end the <a href="Forfeiture%20%28law%29">forfeiture</a> of a felon's lands and goods (thereby not making paupers of his family). The Act limited the penalty for treason to hanging alone, although it did not remove the monarch's right under the 1814 Act to replace hanging with beheading. Beheading was abolished in 1973, although it had long been obsolete. The death penalty for treason was abolished by the <a href="Crime%20and%20Disorder%20Act%201998">Crime and Disorder Act 1998</a>, enabling the UK to ratify protocol six of the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> in 1999.

In some of the places where the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a> developed into a fierce civil war among American factions, there are recorded cases of both sides resorting to hanging, drawing, and quartering - both Loyalists and Patriots finding reasons to construe their opponents as being "traitors" deserving of such a fate.

The <a href="Eighth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>'s prohibition of "<a href="Cruel%20and%20Unusual%20Punishment">Cruel and Unusual Punishment</a>s" clearly (and successfully) aimed at preventing any further such usage on American soil.

Urse d'Abetot

Urse d'Abetot (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1040 – 1108) was a <a href="Normans">Norman</a> who followed King <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William I</a> to England, and became <a href="Sheriff%20of%20Worcestershire">Sheriff of Worcestershire</a> and a royal official under him and Kings <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William II</a> and <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>. He was a native of <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> and moved to England shortly after the <a href="Norman%20Conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest of England</a> in 1066, and was appointed sheriff in about 1069. Little is known of his family in Normandy, who were not prominent. Although Urse's lord in Normandy was present at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, there is no evidence that Urse took part in the invasion of England in 1066.

Urse built the earliest form of <a href="Worcester%20Castle">Worcester Castle</a> in <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>, which encroached on the cathedral cemetery there, earning him a curse from the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>. Urse helped to put down a rebellion against King William I in 1075, and quarrelled with the Church in his county over the jurisdiction of the sheriffs. He continued in the service of William's sons after the king's death, and was appointed <a href="constable">constable</a> under William II and <a href="marshal">marshal</a> under Henry I. Urse was known for his acquisitiveness, and during William II's reign was considered second only to <a href="Ranulf%20Flambard">Ranulf Flambard</a>, another royal official, in his rapacity. Urse's son succeeded him as sheriff but was subsequently exiled, thus forfeiting the office. Through his daughter, Urse is an ancestor of the Beauchamp family, who eventually became <a href="Earls%20of%20Warwick">Earls of Warwick</a>.

On 5 January 1066 <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a>, died. Edward's lack of children meant there was no clear legitimate successor, leading eventually to a succession dispute. Some medieval writers state that shortly before Edward's death he named his brother-in-law, <a href="Harold%20II%20of%20England">Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex</a>, as his heir. Others claim that Edward had promised the throne to his cousin, <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a>, a powerful autonomous ruler in northern France. Harold, the most powerful English noble, took the initiative and was crowned king on 6 January. William, lacking Harold's proximity to the centres of English royal government, gathered troops and prepared an invasion fleet. He invaded England in October, and subsequently defeated and killed Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. William was crowned on Christmas Day at Westminster, becoming William I.

Between his coronation and 1071, William consolidated his hold over England, defeating a number of rebellions that arose particularly in the north and west of the country. Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility had been replaced by Norman and other continental nobles.

The main sources for Urse's life are English documents such as <a href="charter">charter</a>s and <a href="writ">writ</a>s which mention his activities. Often these are contained in collections of such documents, known as <a href="cartulary">cartularies</a>, which were assembled by monasteries and <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>s to document their landholdings. Cartularies frequently contain documents from landholders surrounding a monastery, which is the case with many of the documents mentioning Urse. Other sources of information on Urse are Domesday Book, which mentions his landholdings in 1086, and a number of chronicles, including <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>'s "<a href="Gesta%20pontificum%20Anglorum">Gesta pontificum Anglorum</a>", <a href="Florence%20of%20Worcester">Florence of Worcester</a>'s "Chronicon ex chronicis", and "<a href="Hemming%27s%20Cartulary">Hemming's Cartulary</a>", a mixed chronicle and cartulary from <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester Cathedral</a>. There are also mentions of Urse in Norman sources, such as charters for <a href="Saint-Georges%20de%20Boscherville%20Abbey">Saint-Georges de Boscherville Abbey</a>.

Urse came from an undistinguished family, and made his way on military reputation. He was probably born in about 1040, but the exact date is unknown. He was from <a href="St%20Jean%20d%27Abbetot">St Jean d'Abbetot</a> in Normandy, where his family had lands, and where he himself was a tenant of the lords of <a href="Tancarville">Tancarville</a>. Other tenants of the Tancarville lords included Robert d'Abetot and his wife Lesza, who held lands close to St Jean d'Abbetot in the early 12th century; despite the name, it is not certain that Robert d'Abetot was related to Urse. Urse had a brother usually called <a href="Robert%20Despenser">Robert Despenser</a>, sometimes known as Robert fitz Thurstin, who also became a royal official. The historian Emma Mason suggested that Urse may have been a nickname rather than a forename, perhaps given on account of his tenacious temperament. Urse's usual last name derives from his ancestral village in Normandy. His brother's usual last name of Despenser derives from his office, that of "dispenser", in the royal household.

Ralph, the Lord of Tancarville during the reign of King William I of England and Urse's overlord in Normandy, fought at the Battle of Hastings, but there is no evidence that Urse himself was present. He is probably the same person as the "Urse d'Abetot" who was a witness to a charter of William before the invasion of England. The historian Lewis Loyd refers to Urse as "in origin a man of no importance who made his way as a soldier of fortune".

Urse arrived in England after Hastings, but it is unknown if his brother Robert arrived with him or separately. Urse was appointed Sheriff of Worcestershire some time after the Norman Conquest of England, probably in about 1069, part of the wholesale replacement of English royal officials with Norman and other immigrants that took place in the early part of William's reign. As sheriff, Urse was responsible for collecting taxes and forwarding them to the treasury, and was empowered to raise armies if rebellion or invasion threatened. The sheriff presided over the <a href="shire%20court">shire court</a>, and was accountable for the shire's annual payments to the king. During the reigns of William the Conqueror and his sons, the office of sheriff was a powerful one, as it did not share power with any other official in the shire, unless there was an earl in overall control. Because of their control of the courts for the hundreds – which were subdivisions of the shire – sheriffs had opportunities for <a href="patronage">patronage</a> and also had a large say in who became members of the <a href="jury">hundred and shire court juries</a>. The death of <a href="Edwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Edwin, Earl of Mercia</a>, who held power in Worcestershire until his death in 1071 during a rebellion against William, allowed Urse to accumulate more authority in Worcestershire, as Edwin was the last Earl of Mercia.

Urse also oversaw the construction of a new castle at the town of <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>, although nothing now remains of the castle. <a href="Worcester%20Castle">Worcester Castle</a> was in place by 1069, its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The <a href="Motte%20and%20Bailey">motte</a> of the castle overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral. Although Urse had control of the castle after it was built, by 1088 he had lost it to the bishops of Worcester.

In 1075, three earls rebelled, for reasons unknown, and sought aid from the <a href="List%20of%20Danish%20monarchs">King of Denmark</a>, <a href="Sweyn%20II%20of%20Denmark">Sweyn II Estridsson</a>, who had a distant claim to the English throne. Among the rebels was <a href="Roger%20de%20Breteuil%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Roger de Breteuil</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Hereford">Earl of Hereford</a>, whose lands neighboured those of Urse. Along with <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester</a>, Abbot <a href="%C3%86thelwig">Æthelwig</a> of Evesham, and <a href="Walter%20de%20Lacy%20%28died%201085%29">Walter de Lacy</a>, Urse prevented de Breteuil from crossing the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a>. Urse's actions kept the rebels from seizing control of the <a href="Severn%20Valley%20%28England%29">Severn Valley</a> and joining up with the other English rebels, <a href="Waltheof%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Waltheof</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Earl of Northumbria</a>, and <a href="Ralph%20de%20Gael">Ralph de Gael</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Earl of Norfolk</a>. Urse and the magnates fighting alongside him, in addition to their obvious desire to suppress rebellion, had an interest in defeating de Breteuil, as he was the most powerful lord in the area. De Breteuil was caught, tried, and imprisoned for life, increasing the power of his rivals.

Urse, along with his contemporaries, benefited from the increasing power wielded by the sheriffs. Although royal officials, including the sheriffs, had been appropriating ecclesiastical lands since the late 10th century, in the immediate years after the Norman Conquest churchmen complained about the increased amount of land seized by the sheriffs. Urse received his share of complaints, but he was part of a wider trend during the early years of William I's reign. The appropriation of land led to an increase in the recording of rights and possessions not only by clergy but also by laymen, culminating in the recording of all possessions and the rights held by the king over them in the Domesday Survey of 1086. This behaviour was not limited to the sheriffs, as other nobles were also accused in contemporary chronicles of appropriating land from churches and from native Englishmen.

During the reign of William I, Urse became involved in a dispute with Bishop Wulfstan over the rights of the sheriff in the lands of the diocese. By the time of Domesday Book in 1086, Urse's powers as sheriff had been excluded from the <a href="Oswaldslow%20%28hundred%29">Oswaldslaw</a>, the area of Worcestershire controlled by the bishops of Worcester. Domesday Book records that the Oswaldslaw was regarded as an immunity, exempt from judicial actions by royal officials. Urse complained that this immunity reduced his income, but this did not affect the outcome of his dispute with Wulfstan, who prevailed. Although Wulfstan claimed that the immunity dated from before the Conquest, it actually owed its existence to the ability of the bishop to fill the shire court with his supporters, and thus influence the findings of the court.

Urse was also involved in a dispute between Wulfstan and <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a> over lands in Worcestershire as, after the Conquest, Urse acquired the lands of Azur, a kinsman of an earlier Bishop of Worcester, <a href="Beorhtheah">Beorhtheah</a>. Azur had originally leased the lands from the diocese, but after Urse confiscated the lands, the sheriff did not return the lands to the bishop, and instead kept them for himself. The Worcester monk <a href="Hemming%20%28monk%29">Hemming</a> recorded the loss of the lands to Urse in "Hemming's Cartulary", a cartulary written about 1095 recording lands and charters belonging to the diocese of Worcester. "Hemmings' Cartulary" mentions not just Azur's lands, but others at <a href="Acton%20Beauchamp">Acton Beauchamp</a>, <a href="Clopton%2C%20Northamptonshire">Clopton</a>, and <a href="Redmarley%20D%27Abitot">Redmarley</a> as taken from the diocese of Worcester by Urse. After Abbot Æthelwig's death, Urse also acquired lands that Æthelwig had seized through less than legal means, when William I's half-brother <a href="Odo%20of%20Bayeux">Odo of Bayeux</a>, the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Bayeux">Bishop of Bayeux</a>, presided at the lawsuit brought to determine the ownership of the lands. Odo gave a number of the disputed estates to Urse during the course of the lawsuit.

The 12th-century chronicler William of Malmesbury records how, shortly after Urse was appointed sheriff, he built a castle which encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter of Worcester Cathedral. <a href="Ealdred%20%28archbishop%20of%20York%29">Ealdred</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, pronounced a rhyming curse on Urse, declaring "Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse." Ealdred had been Bishop of Worcester before becoming archbishop, and still retained an interest in the diocese. <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a>, a late 12th- and early 13th-century writer, wrote that Wulfstan uttered the curse after Urse had attempted to have Wulfstan deposed as bishop. Gerald goes on to relate that Wulfstan stated he would only relinquish his episcopal staff to the king who had granted it, William I's predecessor, Edward the Confessor. Gerard then reports that Wulfstan proceeded to work a miracle at Edward's tomb, a miracle so impressive that King William confirmed Wulfstan in his episcopate. Although Urse did not succeed in removing Wulfstan, and although there are certainly embellishments added in Gerald's story, it is clear that Urse and Wulfstan were the main powers in Worcestershire, and were thus great rivals.

The Archbishop's curse had no discernible effect, either on Urse's career or the castle. Other chroniclers record that Urse stole monastic lands, including some from Evesham Abbey. Urse gained a reputation for greed and avarice, especially with regard to church lands. <a href="Great%20Malvern%20Priory">Great Malvern Priory</a>, however, claimed him as a founder in a 14th-century document.

In 1086, the Domesday Survey documents that while the majority of Urse's lands were in <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, he also held land in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>, and <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>. His lands in Warwickshire were held directly from the king, as a <a href="tenant-in-chief">tenant-in-chief</a>, while others were held as an <a href="under-tenant">under-tenant</a> of others who had their lands directly from the king. Urse's lands in Herefordshire likewise were held as a mixture of tenant-in-chief and sub-tenant, as was also the case in Gloucester. Of the lands that Urse held in Worcestershire, he held them both directly from the king and from the Bishop of Worcester. Domesday also records that the revenue that Urse was responsible for as sheriff was £128 and 4 shillings from Worcestershire. This was just the amount due for the royal estates in Worcester, as Urse was also responsible for payments of £23 and 5 shillings for the royal lands in the <a href="Borough">Borough</a> of Worcester, £17 as profits on the shire and hundred courts with an additional £16 or a hunting hawk, specifically a "Norway hawk"; also due from the courts. Urse also had to pay the queen £5 plus £1 additional for a "sumpter horse". All of these payments were guaranteed by Urse, who had to make up any shortfall.

Domesday makes it obvious that Urse was the most powerful layman in Worcester, and the only person who could contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester. The power struggle continued into the 12th century, as Urse's descendants still contested the bishops. Only one other layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.

After the death of King William I of England, Urse continued to serve William's sons and successors, Kings William II Rufus and Henry I. While William I granted the <a href="duchy%20of%20Normandy">duchy of Normandy</a> to his eldest son, <a href="Robert%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Robert Curthose</a>, England went to his second surviving son, William Rufus. Henry (later Henry I), the youngest son, was given a sum of money. In 1088, shortly after William Rufus became king, Urse was present at the trial of <a href="William%20de%20St-Calais">William de St-Calais</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, and is mentioned in "<a href="De%20Iniusta%20Vexacione%20Willelmi%20Episcopi%20Primi">De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi</a>", a contemporary account of the trial. During William I's reign, Urse had served the king mainly as a regional official, but during William II's reign Urse began to take a broader role in the kingdom as a whole. Urse became a constable in the <a href="curia%20regis">king's household</a> for both William II and Henry I, and under William II, he ascended to the office of marshal.

Urse was an assistant to William II's main minister, Ranulf Flambard, and frequently served as a royal judge. The historian Emma Mason argues that Urse, along with Flambard, <a href="Robert%20Fitzhamon">Robert Fitzhamon</a>, <a href="Roger%20Bigod%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Roger Bigod</a>, <a href="Haimo%20%28dapifer%29">Haimo</a> the dapifer, or <a href="seneschal">seneschal</a>, and <a href="Eudo%20Dapifer">Eudo</a>, another dapifer, were the first recognisable <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Baron%20of%20the%20Exchequer">barons of the Exchequer</a>. During his absence from England, the king addressed a number of writs to Urse, along with Haimo, Eudo, and <a href="Robert%20Bloet">Robert Bloet</a>, ordering them to enforce William's decisions there. The historian Francis West, who studied the office of the <a href="justiciar">justiciar</a>ship, asserts that Haimo, Eudo, and Urse, along with Flambard, could be considered the first English justiciars.

Urse's estates grew under William II, partly as a result of the inheritance of some of the lands of his brother, Robert Despenser, who died about 1097. Later, Urse consolidated his holdings by exchanging some of Robert's lands in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> with <a href="de%20Lacy">Robert de Lacy</a> for lands closer to his base in Worcestershire. Urse d'Abetot gained and passed to his heirs an estate that later became the Barony of <a href="Salwarpe">Salwarpe</a>, Worcestershire.

William II died in a hunting accident on 2 August 1100. His younger brother Henry immediately rode to Winchester and had himself crowned king before his elder brother, Robert Curthose, could claim the throne. Although Urse did not attest the <a href="Charter%20of%20Liberties">charter</a> Henry issued after he seized the throne, Urse was at court shortly afterwards. When Robert Curthose invaded England in 1101 in an attempt to take the English throne, Urse supported Henry. Urse was present at the court held at Winchester on 2 August 1101, when a peace treaty was ratified between the brothers. During Henry's reign, the king regranted Urse's lands to him, with some of them now granted as a tenant-in-chief when previously Urse had held those lands as an under-tenant, and not directly from the king. Urse's lands at Salwarpe were previously held by <a href="Roger%20de%20Montgomerie%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Roger of Montgomery</a>, but were granted to Urse as a direct tenant of the king when Roger's son, <a href="Robert%20of%20Bell%C3%AAme%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Robert of Belesme</a>, was outlawed in 1102. Urse continued to attest many of Henry's charters until 1108, although he did not use the title of "constable" in those charters.

Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry addressed a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates other than those normal for such courts. From this, the historian <a href="Judith%20Green%20%28historian%29">Judith Green</a> speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining those who did not attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure that could be used in what type of case.

Urse died some time in 1108. Little is known of his wife, Alice, whose death is unrecorded. Urse was succeeded as sheriff by his son <a href="Roger%20d%27Abetot">Roger d'Abetot</a>, who was exiled in about 1110 and forfeited the office of sheriff. Roger's successor, Osbert d'Abetot, was probably Urse's brother. Urse also had a daughter, probably named Emmeline, who married <a href="Walter%20de%20Beauchamp%20%28nobleman%29">Walter de Beauchamp</a>. Walter succeeded to Urse's lands after Roger's exile. A charter for the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Saint-Georges%2C%20Boscherville">Abbey of Saint-Georges, Boscherville</a> may indicate that Urse had a second son, named Robert. Urse may also have had another daughter, who married <a href="Robert%20Marmion%2C%201st%20Baron%20Marmion%20of%20Tamworth">Robert Marmion</a>, as some of Urse's estates went to Marmion's family and others to the Beauchamps.

Urse earned a reputation for extortion and financial exactions. During the reign of William II, he was considered second only to the king's minister Ranulf Flambard in his rapacity. The first mention of his exactions is in "Hemming's Cartulary". Further details were given by the medieval chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Gerald of Wales, both of whom relate Ealdred's curse. His exactions were also mentioned in "Domesday Book", where an entry in the survey for Gloucestershire noted that he oppressed the inhabitants of <a href="Sodbury">Sodbury</a> so much that they were unable to pay their customary rents. He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates, <a href="Greenhill%2C%20Evesham">Greenhill</a> and Eastbury. Urse was one of a new breed of royal official, one who was not opposed to royal power but rather welcomed it, as it helped his own position.

Through his daughter, he is an ancestor of the Beauchamp family of <a href="Elmley%20Castle%20%28castle%29">Elmley Castle</a> in Worcestershire, a scion of which, <a href="William%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">William de Beauchamp</a>, became <a href="Earl%20of%20Warwick">Earl of Warwick</a>. It is likely that the Beauchamp family's emblem, a bear, derives from their relationship to Urse.

Skye

Skye, or the Isle of Skye (; or ), is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the <a href="Inner%20Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a> of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the <a href="Cuillin">Cuillin,</a> the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country. Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins.

The island has been occupied since the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period, and its history includes a time of <a href="Norsemen">Norse</a> rule and a long period of domination by <a href="Clan%20MacLeod">Clan MacLeod</a> and <a href="Clan%20MacDonald">Clan Donald</a>. The 18th century <a href="Jacobite%20risings">Jacobite risings</a> led to the breaking up of the <a href="Scottish%20clan">clan</a> system and subsequent <a href="Highland%20Clearances">Clearances</a> that replaced entire communities with sheep farms, some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands. Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century. Skye's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001. About a third of the residents were <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Gaelic</a> speakers in 2001, and although their numbers are in decline, this aspect of island culture remains important.

The main industries are tourism, agriculture, fishing and forestry. Skye is part of the <a href="Highland%20Council">Highland Council</a> local government area. The island's largest settlement is <a href="Portree">Portree</a>, which is also its capital, known for its picturesque harbour. There are links to various nearby islands by ferry and, since 1995, to the mainland by <a href="Skye%20Bridge">a road bridge</a>. The climate is mild, wet and windy. The abundant wildlife includes the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> and <a href="Atlantic%20salmon">Atlantic salmon</a>. The local flora are dominated by <a href="ericaceae">heather</a> <a href="moorland">moor</a>, and there are nationally important <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> populations on the surrounding sea bed. Skye has provided the locations for various novels and feature films and is celebrated in poetry and song.

The first written references to the island are <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> sources such as the "<a href="Ravenna%20Cosmography">Ravenna Cosmography</a>", which refers to "Scitis" and "Scetis", which can be found on a map by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>. One possible derivation comes from "skitis", an early <a href="Celt">Celt</a>ic word for "winged", which may describe how the island's peninsulas radiate out from a mountainous centre. Subsequent Gaelic-, Norse- and English-speaking peoples have influenced the history of Skye; the relationships between their names for the island are not straightforward. Various etymologies have been proposed, such as the "winged isle" or "the notched isle" but no definitive solution has been found to date; the place name may be from an earlier, non-Gaelic language.

In the Norse sagas Skye is called , for example in the and a <a href="skald">skald</a>ic poem in the from c. 1230 contains a line that translates as "the hunger battle-birds were filled in Skye with blood of foemen killed". The island was also referred to by the Norse as (misty isle), or (isle of cloud). The traditional Gaelic name is (the island of Skye), being a more recent and less common spelling. In 1549 <a href="Donald%20Monro%20%28priest%29">Donald Munro</a>, High Dean of the Isles, wrote of "Sky": "" but the meaning of this Gaelic name is unclear.

, which means "island of the mist" (a translation of the Norse name), is a poetic Gaelic name for the island.

At , Skye is the second-largest <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Scotland">island in Scotland</a> after <a href="Lewis%20and%20Harris">Lewis and Harris</a>. The coastline of Skye is a series of peninsulas and bays radiating out from a centre dominated by the <a href="Cuillin">Cuillin</a> hills (Gaelic: ). <a href="Malcolm%20Slesser">Malcolm Slesser</a> suggested that its shape "sticks out of the west coast of northern Scotland like a lobster's claw ready to snap at the fish bone of Harris and Lewis" and <a href="W.%20H.%20Murray">W. H. Murray</a>, commenting on its irregular coastline, stated that "Skye is sixty miles [100 km] long, but what might be its breadth is beyond the ingenuity of man to state".
<a href="Martin%20Martin">Martin Martin</a>, a native of the island, reported on it at length in a 1703 publication. His geological observations included a note that:

The Black Cuillin, which are mainly composed of <a href="basalt">basalt</a> and <a href="gabbro">gabbro</a>, include twelve <a href="Munro">Munro</a>s and provide some of the most dramatic and challenging mountain terrain in Scotland. The ascent of is one of the longest rock climbs in Britain and the <a href="Inaccessible%20Pinnacle">Inaccessible Pinnacle</a> is the only peak in Scotland that requires <a href="rock%20climbing">technical climbing skills</a> to reach the summit. These hills make demands of the <a href="hillwalking">hill walker</a> that exceed any others found in Scotland and a full traverse of the Cuillin ridge may take 15–20 hours. The Red Hills (Gaelic: ) to the south are also known as the Red Cuillin. They are mainly composed of <a href="granite">granite</a> that has weathered into more rounded hills with many long scree slopes on their flanks. The highest point of these hills is <a href="Glamaig">Glamaig</a>, one of only two <a href="Corbett%20%28hill%29">Corbetts</a> on Skye.

The northern peninsula of <a href="Trotternish">Trotternish</a> is underlain by basalt, which provides relatively rich soils and a variety of unusual rock features. The Kilt Rock is named after the <a href="tartan">tartan</a>-like patterns in the cliffs. The <a href="Quiraing">Quiraing</a> is a spectacular series of <a href="rock%20pinnacle">rock pinnacle</a>s on the eastern side of the main spine of the peninsula and further south is the rock pillar of the <a href="The%20Storr">Old Man of Storr</a>.

Beyond <a href="Loch%20Snizort">Loch Snizort</a> to the west of Trotternish is the <a href="Waternish">Waternish</a> peninsula, which ends in Ardmore Point's double rock arch. <a href="Duirinish%2C%20Skye">Duirinish</a> is separated from Waternish by Loch Dunvegan, which contains the island of <a href="Isay">Isay</a>. The loch is ringed by sea cliffs that reach 295 metres (967 ft) at Waterstein Head. <a href="Oolite">Oolitic</a> loam provides good arable land in the <a href="strath">main valley</a>. Lochs Bracadale and Harport and the island of <a href="Wiay%2C%20Skye">Wiay</a> lie between Duirinish and <a href="Minginish">Minginish</a>, which includes the <a href="glen">narrower defiles</a> of <a href="Talisker%2C%20Skye">Talisker</a> and Glen Brittle and whose beaches are formed from black basaltic sands. <a href="Strathaird">Strathaird</a> is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few <a href="Croft%20%28land%29">crofting</a> communities, the island of <a href="Soay%2C%20Skye">Soay</a> lies offshore. The bedrock of <a href="Sleat">Sleat</a> in the south is Torridonian <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, which produces poor soils and boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered eastern shores enable a lush growth of hedgerows and crops. The islands of <a href="Raasay">Raasay</a>, <a href="South%20Rona">Rona</a>, <a href="Scalpay%2C%20Inner%20Hebrides">Scalpay</a> and <a href="Pabay">Pabay</a> all lie to the north and east between Skye and the mainland.

<a href="Portree">Portree</a> in the north at the base of Trotternish is the largest settlement (estimated population 2,264 in 2011) and is the main service centre on the island. <a href="Broadford%2C%20Skye">Broadford</a>, the location of the <a href="Broadford%20Airfield">island's only airstrip</a>, is on the east side of the island and <a href="Dunvegan">Dunvegan</a> in the north-west is well known for its <a href="Dunvegan%20Castle">castle</a> and the nearby <a href="The%20Three%20Chimneys">Three Chimneys</a> restaurant. The 18th-century Stein Inn on the Waternish coast is the oldest pub on Skye. <a href="Kyleakin">Kyleakin</a> is linked to <a href="Kyle%20of%20Lochalsh">Kyle of Lochalsh</a> on the mainland by the <a href="Skye%20Bridge">Skye Bridge</a>, which spans the narrows of <a href="Loch%20Alsh">Loch Alsh</a>. <a href="Uig%2C%20Skye">Uig</a>, the port for ferries to the <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>, is on the west of the Trotternish peninsula and <a href="Edinbane">Edinbane</a> is between Dunvegan and Portree. Much of the rest of the population lives in crofting townships scattered around the coastline.

The influence of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> create a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging in January and in July at <a href="Duntulm">Duntulm</a> in Trotternish. Snow seldom lies at sea level and frosts are less frequent than on the mainland. Winds are a limiting factor for vegetation. South-westerlies are the most common and speeds of have been recorded. High winds are especially likely on the exposed coasts of Trotternish and Waternish. In common with most islands of the west coast of Scotland, rainfall is generally high at per annum and the elevated Cuillin are wetter still. Variations can be considerable, with the north tending to be drier than the south. Broadford, for example, averages more than of rain per annum. Trotternish typically has 200 hours of bright sunshine in May, the sunniest month. On 28 December 2015, the temperature reached 15 °C, beating the previous December record of 12.9 °C, set in 2013. On 9 May 2016, a temperature of 26.7 °C (80.1 °F) was recorded at Lusa in the south-east of the island. 

A <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> hunter-gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC at in <a href="Staffin">Staffin</a> is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Scotland. Its occupation is probably linked to that of the rock shelter at <a href="Sand%2C%20Applecross">Sand, Applecross</a>, on the mainland coast of <a href="Ross%20and%20Cromarty">Wester Ross</a> where tools made of a <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a> from have been found. Surveys of the area between the two shores of the <a href="Inner%20Sound%2C%20Scotland">Inner Sound</a> and Sound of Raasay have revealed 33 sites with potentially Mesolithic deposits. Finds of <a href="heliotrope%20%28mineral%29">bloodstone</a> <a href="microlith">microlith</a>s on the foreshore at <a href="Orbost%2C%20Highland">Orbost</a> on the west coast of the island near Dunvegan also suggest Mesolithic occupation. These tools probably originate from the nearby island of .

, an uninhabited peninsula to the south of the <a href="Cuillin">Cuillin</a>, has a variety of archaeological sites dating from the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> onwards. There is a 2nd or 3rd millennium BC <a href="chambered%20cairn">chambered cairn</a>, an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> promontory fort and the remains of another prehistoric settlement dating from the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> nearby. on the peninsula is linked to the sea by an artificial "Viking" canal that may date from the later period of Norse settlement. <a href="Dun%20Ringill">Dun Ringill</a> is a ruined <a href="Prehistoric%20Scotland%23Iron%20age">Iron Age</a> hill fort on the Strathaird peninsula, which was further fortified in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and may have become the seat of <a href="Clan%20MacKinnon">Clan MacKinnon</a>.

The late Iron Age inhabitants of the northern and western Hebrides were probably <a href="Pict">Pict</a>ish, although the historical record is sparse. Three <a href="Pictish%20symbol%20stones">Pictish symbol stones</a> have been found on Skye and a fourth on Raasay. More is known of the kingdom of to the south; <a href="Adomn%C3%A1n">Adomnán</a>'s life of <a href="Columba">Columba</a>, written shortly before 697, portrays the saint visiting Skye (where he baptised a pagan leader using an interpreter) and Adomnán himself is thought to have been familiar with the island. The <a href="Irish%20annals">Irish annals</a> record a number of events on Skye in the later 7th and early 8th centuries – mainly concerning the struggles between rival dynasties that formed the background to the <a href="Old%20Irish%20language">Old Irish language</a> romance .

The Norse held sway throughout the Hebrides from the 9th century until after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Perth">Treaty of Perth</a> in 1266. However, apart from placenames, little remains of their presence on Skye in the written or archaeological record. Apart from the name "Skye" itself, all pre-Norse placenames seem to have been obliterated by the <a href="Scandinavian%20Scotland">Scandinavian settlers</a>. <a href="Viking">Viking</a> heritage is claimed by <a href="Clan%20MacLeod">Clan MacLeod</a> and Norse tradition is celebrated in the winter fire festival at Dunvegan, during which a replica Viking long boat is set alight.

The most powerful clans on Skye in the post–Norse period were Clan MacLeod, originally based in Trotternish, and <a href="Clan%20Macdonald%20of%20Sleat">Clan Macdonald of Sleat</a>. Following the disintegration of the <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Isles">Lordship of the Isles</a>, the Mackinnons also emerged as an independent clan, whose substantial landholdings in Skye were centred on Strathaird. <a href="Clan%20MacNeacail">Clan MacNeacail</a> also have a long association with Trotternish, and in the 16th century many of the <a href="MacInnes%20clan">MacInnes clan</a> moved to Sleat. The MacDonalds of <a href="South%20Uist">South Uist</a> were bitter rivals of the MacLeods, and an attempt by the former to murder church-goers at <a href="Trumpan">Trumpan</a> in retaliation for a previous massacre on <a href="Eigg">Eigg</a>, resulted in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Spoiling%20Dyke">Battle of the Spoiling Dyke</a> of 1578.

After the failure of the <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> rebellion of 1745, <a href="Flora%20MacDonald%20%28Scottish%20Jacobite%29">Flora MacDonald</a> became famous for rescuing Prince <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Stuart">Charles Edward Stuart</a> from the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverian</a> troops. Although she was born on South Uist her story is strongly associated with their escape via Skye and she is buried at <a href="Kilmuir%2C%20Skye">Kilmuir</a> in Trotternish. <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> and <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a>'s visit to Skye in 1773 and their meeting with Flora MacDonald in Kilmuir is recorded in Boswell's "<a href="The%20Journal%20of%20a%20Tour%20to%20the%20Hebrides">The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</a>". Boswell wrote, "To see Dr Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the English Tories, salute Miss Flora MacDonald in the isle of Sky, was a striking sight; for though somewhat congenial in their notions, it was very improbable they should meet here". Johnson's words that Flora MacDonald was "A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour" are written on her gravestone. After this rebellion the clan system was broken up and Skye became a series of landed estates.

Of the island in general, Johnson observed:

Skye has a rich heritage of ancient monuments from this period. Dunvegan Castle has been the seat of Clan MacLeod since the 13th century. It contains the <a href="Fairy%20Flag">Fairy Flag</a> and is reputed to have been inhabited by a single family for longer than any other house in Scotland. The 18th-century <a href="Armadale%20Castle">Armadale Castle</a>, once home of <a href="Clan%20Donald">Clan Donald</a> of Sleat, was abandoned as a residence in 1925 but now hosts the Clan Donald Centre. Nearby are the ruins of two more MacDonald strongholds, <a href="Knock%20Castle%20%28Isle%20of%20Skye%29">Knock Castle</a>, and <a href="Dunscaith%20Castle">Dunscaith Castle</a> (called "Fortress of Shadows"), the legendary home of warrior woman, martial arts instructor (and, according to some sources, Queen) . , built in the late 15th century near Kyleakin and once a seat of Clan MacKinnon, is another ruin.

In the late 18th century the harvesting of <a href="kelp">kelp</a> became a significant activity but from 1822 on cheap imports led to a collapse of this industry throughout the Hebrides. During the 19th century, the inhabitants of Skye were also devastated by <a href="famine">famine</a> and <a href="Highland%20Clearances">Clearances</a>. Thirty thousand people were evicted between 1840 and 1880 alone, many of them forced to emigrate to the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>. For example, the settlement of Lorgill on the west coast of Duirinish was cleared on 4 August 1830. Every crofter under the age of seventy was removed and placed on board the "Midlothian" on threat of imprisonment, with those over that age being sent to the <a href="poorhouse">poorhouse</a>. The "<a href="Camastianavaig">Battle of the Braes</a>" involved a demonstration against a lack of access to land and the serving of eviction notices. The incident involved numerous crofters and about 50 police officers. This event was instrumental in the creation of the <a href="Napier%20Commission">Napier Commission</a>, which reported in 1884 on the situation in the Highlands. Disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 <a href="Crofters%27%20Holdings%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201886">Crofters' Act</a> and on one occasion 400 <a href="marine%20%28military%29">marines</a> were deployed on Skye to maintain order. The ruins of cleared villages can still be seen at Lorgill, <a href="Boreraig">Boreraig</a> and Suisnish in Strath Swordale, and Tusdale on Minginish.

As with many Scottish islands, Skye's population peaked in the 19th century and then declined under the impact of the Clearances and the military losses in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. From the 19th century until 1975 Skye was part of the county of <a href="Inverness-shire">Inverness-shire</a> but the crofting economy languished and according to Slesser, "Generations of UK governments have treated the island people contemptuously." a charge that has been levelled at both <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> and <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> administrations' policies in the <a href="Highlands%20and%20Islands">Highlands and Islands</a>. By 1971 the population was less than a third of its peak recorded figure in 1841. However, the number of residents then grew by over 28 per cent in the thirty years to 2001.

The changing relationship between the residents and the land is evidenced by Robert Carruthers's remark circa 1852 that, "There is now a village in Portree containing three hundred inhabitants." Even if this estimate is inexact the population of the island's largest settlement has probably increased sixfold or more since then. During the period the total number of island residents has declined by 50 per cent or more.

The island-wide population increase of 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001 occurred against the background of an overall reduction in Scottish island populations of 3 per cent for the same period. By 2011 the population had risen a further 8.4% to 10,008 with Scottish island populations as a whole growing by 4% to 103,702.

Historically, Skye was overwhelmingly Gaelic-speaking, but this changed between 1921 and 2001. In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses, all Skye parishes were more than 75 per cent Gaelic-speaking. By 1971, only Kilmuir parish had more than three quarters Gaelic speakers while the rest of Skye ranged between 50 and 74 per cent. At that time, Kilmuir was the only area outside the Western Isles that had such a high proportion of Gaelic speakers. In the 2001 census Kilmuir had just under half Gaelic speakers, and overall, Skye had 31 per cent, distributed unevenly. The strongest Gaelic areas were in the north and south-west of the island, including Staffin at 61 per cent. The weakest areas were in the west and east (e.g. <a href="Luib%2C%20Skye">Luib</a> 23 per cent and <a href="Kylerhea">Kylerhea</a> 19 per cent). Other areas on Skye ranged between 48 per cent and 25 per cent.

In terms of <a href="local%20government%20of%20Scotland">local government</a>, from 1975 to 1996, Skye, along with the neighbouring mainland area of <a href="Lochalsh">Lochalsh</a>, constituted a local government district within the Highland administrative area. In 1996 the district was included into the unitary <a href="Highland%20Council">Highland Council</a>, () based in <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a> and formed one of the new council's <a href="area%20committees">area committees</a>. Following the <a href="Scottish%20local%20elections%2C%202007">2007 elections</a>, Skye now forms a four-member ward called ; it is currently represented by two <a href="independent%20%28politician%29">independents</a>, one <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish National Party</a>, and one <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrat</a> councillor.

Skye is in the <a href="Highlands%20and%20Islands%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20electoral%20region%29">Highlands and Islands electoral region</a> and comprises a part of the <a href="Skye%2C%20Lochaber%20and%20Badenoch%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch</a> constituency of the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>, which elects one <a href="member%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament">member</a> under the <a href="first%20past%20the%20post">first past the post</a> basis to represent it. <a href="Kate%20Forbes">Kate Forbes</a> is the current MSP for the SNP. In addition, Skye forms part of the wider <a href="Ross%2C%20Skye%20and%20Lochaber%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Ross, Skye and Lochaber</a> constituency, which elects one member to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Westminster</a>. The present MP <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> is <a href="Ian%20Blackford">Ian Blackford</a> of the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish National Party</a>, who took office after the SNP's sweep in the General Election of 2015. Prior to this, <a href="Charles%20Kennedy">Charles Kennedy</a>, a Liberal Democrat, had represented the area since the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201983">1983 general election</a>.

The largest employer on the island and its environs is the public sector, which accounts for about a third of the total workforce, principally in administration, education and health. The second largest employer in the area is the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector, highlighting the importance of tourism. Key attractions include Dunvegan Castle, the <a href="Clan%20Donald%20Visitor%20Centre">Clan Donald Visitor Centre</a>, and The Aros Experience arts and exhibition centre in Portree. There are about a dozen large landowners on Skye, the largest being the public sector, with the Scottish Government owning most of the northern part of the island. <a href="Glendale%2C%20Skye">Glendale</a> is a community-owned estate in Duirinish and the Sleat Community Trust, the local <a href="development%20trust">development trust</a>, is active in various regeneration projects.

Small firms dominate employment in the private sector. The <a href="Talisker%20Single%20Malt">Talisker Distillery</a>, which produces a <a href="single%20malt%20whisky">single malt whisky</a>, is beside Loch Harport on the west coast of the island. Three other whiskies— ("son of the sea"), ("wee dram of the isles") and ("black pot")—are produced by blender ("smugglers den by the <a href="Sound%20%28geography%29">Sound</a> of <a href="Sleat">Sleat</a>"), based at . These are marketed using predominantly Gaelic-language labels. The blended whisky branded as "Isle of Skye" is produced not on the island but by the <a href="Glengoyne%20Distillery">Glengoyne Distillery</a> at Killearn north of Glasgow, though the website of the owners, Ian Macleod Distillers Ltd., boasts a "high proportion of Island malts" and contains advertisements for tourist businesses in the island. There is also an established software presence on Skye, with Portree-based Sitekit having expanded in recent years.

<a href="Crofting">Crofting</a> is still important, but although there are about 2,000 crofts on Skye only 100 or so are large enough to enable a crofter to earn a livelihood entirely from the land. <a href="Cod">Cod</a> and <a href="herring">herring</a> stocks have declined but commercial fishing remains important, especially <a href="fish%20farming">fish farming</a> of salmon and shellfish such as <a href="Norway%20lobster">scampi</a>. The west coast of Scotland has a considerable <a href="Renewable%20energy%20in%20Scotland">renewable energy potential</a> and the Isle of Skye Renewables Co-op has recently bought a stake in the Ben Aketil wind farm near Dunvegan. There is a thriving arts and crafts sector.

The unemployment rate in the area tends to be higher than in the <a href="Highlands%20of%20Scotland">Highlands</a> as a whole, and is seasonal in nature, in part due to the impact of tourism. The population is growing and in common with many other scenic rural areas in Scotland, significant increases are expected in the percentage of the population aged 45 to 64 years.

Skye is linked to the mainland by the <a href="Skye%20Bridge">Skye Bridge</a>, while ferries sail from <a href="Armadale%2C%20Skye">Armadale</a> on the island to <a href="Mallaig">Mallaig</a>, and from <a href="Kylerhea">Kylerhea</a> to <a href="Glenelg%2C%20Scotland">Glenelg</a>. Ferries also run from <a href="Uig%2C%20Skye">Uig</a> to <a href="Tarbert%2C%20Harris">Tarbert</a> on <a href="Harris%2C%20Outer%20Hebrides">Harris</a> and <a href="Lochmaddy">Lochmaddy</a> on <a href="North%20Uist">North Uist</a>, and from <a href="Sconser">Sconser</a> to Raasay.
The Skye Bridge opened in 1995 under a <a href="private%20finance%20initiative">private finance initiative</a> and the high <a href="toll%20bridge">tolls</a> charged (£5.70 each way for summer visitors) met with widespread opposition, spearheaded by the pressure group SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls). On 21 December 2004 it was announced that the <a href="Scottish%20Government">Scottish Executive</a> had purchased the bridge from its owners and the tolls were immediately removed.

Bus services run to Inverness and <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, and there are local services on the island, mainly starting from Portree or Broadford. Train services run from Kyle of Lochalsh at the mainland end of the Skye Bridge to Inverness, as well as from Glasgow to Mallaig from where the ferry can be caught to Armadale.

The Isle of Skye Airfield at , near Broadford, is used by private aircraft and occasionally by <a href="NHS%20Highland">NHS Highland</a> and the <a href="Scottish%20Ambulance%20Service">Scottish Ambulance Service</a> for transferring patients to hospitals on the mainland.

The <a href="A87%20road">A87</a> trunk road traverses the island from the Skye Bridge to Uig, linking most of the major settlements. Many of the island's roads have been widened in the past forty years although there are still substantial sections of single track road.

Students of Scottish Gaelic travel from all over the world to attend , the Scottish Gaelic college based near <a href="Kilmore%2C%20Skye">Kilmore</a> in Sleat. In addition to members of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> and a smaller number of <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholics</a> many residents of Skye belong to the <a href="Free%20Church%20of%20Scotland%20%28post%201900%29">Free Church of Scotland</a>, known for its strict observance of the <a href="Sabbath%20in%20Christianity">Sabbath</a>.

Skye has a strong <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> tradition, although in recent years dance and rock music have been growing in popularity on the island. Gaelic <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a> band <a href="Runrig">Runrig</a> started in Skye and former singer <a href="Donnie%20Munro">Donnie Munro</a> still works on the island. Runrig's second single and a concert staple is entitled "Skye", the lyrics being partly in English and partly in Gaelic and they have released other songs such as "Nightfall on Marsco" that were inspired by the island. Celtic fusion band the <a href="Peatbog%20Faeries">Peatbog Faeries</a> are based on Skye. <a href="Jethro%20Tull%20%28band%29">Jethro Tull</a> singer <a href="Ian%20Anderson%20%28musician%29">Ian Anderson</a> owned an estate at Strathaird on Skye at one time. Several Tull songs are written about Skye, including "Dun Ringil", "Broadford Bazaar", and "Acres Wild" (which contains the lines "Come with me to the Winged Isle, / Northern father's western child..." in reference to the island itself). The <a href="Isle%20of%20Skye%20Music%20Festival">Isle of Skye Music Festival</a> featured sets from The <a href="Fun%20Lovin%27%20Criminals">Fun Lovin' Criminals</a> and <a href="Sparks%20%28band%29">Sparks</a>, but collapsed in 2007. <a href="Electronic%20music">Electronic music</a>ian <a href="Mylo">Mylo</a> was born on Skye.

The poet <a href="Sorley%20MacLean">Sorley MacLean</a>, a native of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Raasay">Isle of Raasay</a>, which lies off the island's east coast, lived much of his life on Skye. The island has been immortalised in the traditional song "<a href="The%20Skye%20Boat%20Song">The Skye Boat Song</a>" and is the notional setting for the novel "<a href="To%20the%20Lighthouse">To the Lighthouse</a>" by <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, although the Skye of the novel bears little relation to the real island. <a href="John%20Buchan">John Buchan</a>'s descriptions of Skye, as featured in his <a href="Richard%20Hannay">Richard Hannay</a> novel "<a href="Mr%20Standfast">Mr Standfast</a>", are more true to life. is a 2004 Italian language work of non-fiction by . The international bestseller, <a href="https%3A//www.amazon.co.uk/Ice-Twins-S-K-Tremayne/dp/000745922X">The Ice Twins</a>, by <a href="Tom%20Knox%20%28author%29">S K Tremayne</a>, published around the world in 2015–2016, is set in southern Skye, especially around the settlement and islands of <a href="Isleornsay">Isleornsay</a>.
Skye has been used as a location for a number of feature films. The Ashaig aerodrome was used for the opening scenes of the 1980 film "<a href="Flash%20Gordon%20%28film%29">Flash Gordon</a>". "<a href="Stardust%20%282007%20film%29">Stardust</a>", released in 2007 and starring <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a> and <a href="Michelle%20Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>, featured scenes near Uig, <a href="Loch%20Coruisk">Loch Coruisk</a> and the <a href="Quiraing">Quiraing</a>. Another 2007 film, "", was shot almost entirely in various locations on the island. Some of the opening scenes in <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s 2012 feature film "<a href="Prometheus%20%282012%20film%29">Prometheus</a>" were shot and set at the Old Man of Storr. In 1973 "<a href="The%20Highlands%20and%20Islands%20-%20a%20Royal%20Tour">The Highlands and Islands - a Royal Tour</a>", a documentary about Prince Charles's visit to the Highlands and Islands, directed by <a href="Oscar%20Marzaroli">Oscar Marzaroli</a>, was shot partly on Skye.

The "<a href="West%20Highland%20Free%20Press">West Highland Free Press</a>" is published at Broadford. This weekly newspaper takes as its motto ("The Land, the Language and the People"), which reflects its radical, campaigning priorities. The "Free Press" was founded in 1972 and circulates in Skye, Wester Ross and the Outer Hebrides. <a href="Shinty">Shinty</a> is a popular sport played throughout the island and Portree-based <a href="Skye%20Camanachd">Skye Camanachd</a> won the <a href="Camanachd%20Cup">Camanachd Cup</a> in 1990.

The Hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland Britain, but like most of the larger islands, Skye still has a wide variety of species. Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote:

Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that:

In the modern era avian life includes the <a href="Corn%20crake">corncrake</a>, <a href="red-throated%20diver">red-throated diver</a>, <a href="Black-legged%20kittiwake">kittiwake</a>, <a href="Black%20guillemot">tystie</a>, <a href="Atlantic%20puffin">Atlantic puffin</a>, <a href="Common%20goldeneye">goldeneye</a> and <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>. The eggs of the last breeding pair of <a href="White-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed sea eagle</a> in the UK were taken by an egg collector on Skye in 1916 but the species has recently been re-introduced. The <a href="chough">chough</a> last bred on the island in 1900. <a href="Mountain%20hare">Mountain hare</a> (apparently absent in the 18th century) and <a href="European%20rabbit">rabbit</a> are now abundant and preyed upon by <a href="Wildcat">wild cat</a> and <a href="pine%20marten">pine marten</a>. The rich fresh water streams contain <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a>, <a href="Atlantic%20salmon">Atlantic salmon</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20water%20shrew">water shrew</a>. Offshore the <a href="edible%20crab">edible crab</a> and <a href="Ostrea%20edulis">edible oyster</a> are also found, the latter especially in the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important <a href="mussel">horse mussel</a> and <a href="brittle%20star">brittlestar</a> beds in the sea lochs and in 2012 a bed of 100 million <a href="flame%20shell">flame shell</a>s was found during a survey of Loch Alsh. Grey Seals can be seen off the Southern coast.

Heather moor containing <a href="Calluna">ling</a>, <a href="Erica%20cinerea">bell heather</a>, <a href="Erica%20tetralix">cross-leaved heath</a>, <a href="Myrica%20gale">bog myrtle</a> and <a href="fescue">fescue</a>s is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly to produce a soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including <a href="Sagina">alpine pearlwort</a> and <a href="Minuartia">mossy cyphal</a>. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain <a href="Glebionis%20segetum">corn marigold</a> and <a href="corn%20spurry">corn spurry</a>. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast <a href="Dryas%20octopetala">mountain avens</a> and <a href="Huperzia%20selago">fir clubmoss</a>. Minginish produces <a href="Linum%20catharticum">fairy flax</a>, <a href="Hypochaeris">cats-ear</a> and black bog rush. There is a fine example of "<a href="Brachypodium">Brachypodium</a>"-rich <a href="Ash%20tree">ash</a> woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating <a href="silver%20birch">silver birch</a>, <a href="hazel">hazel</a>, <a href="Prunus%20padus">bird cherry</a>, and <a href="Common%20hawthorn">hawthorn</a>.

The local Biodiversity Action Plan recommends land management measures to control the spread of <a href="Senecio%20jacobaea">ragwort</a> and <a href="bracken">bracken</a> and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: <a href="Japanese%20knotweed">Japanese knotweed</a>, <a href="Rhododendron%20ponticum">rhododendron</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand%20flatworm">New Zealand flatworm</a> and <a href="American%20mink">mink</a>. It also identifies problems of over-grazing resulting in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland, caused by the large numbers of <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> and sheep.

"Bale Out: RevoLucian's Christian Bale Remix!" is a <a href="satire">satirical</a> <a href="dance%20remix">dance remix</a> by American <a href="composer">composer</a> <a href="Lucian%20Piane">Lucian Piane</a>, also known as RevoLucian, released on February 2, 2009, to <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a href="Myspace">Myspace</a>. The piece <a href="parody">parodies</a> <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a> by utilizing audio from a July 2008 rant made by the actor on the set of "<a href="Terminator%20Salvation">Terminator Salvation</a>". Various other elements are used in the remix, including pulsating dance track beats and clips of <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of then-<a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, creating the impression of Streisand arguing with Bale.

The day after its release, the YouTube page for the song had been viewed over 200,000 times, and over a million times by February 5, 2009. The <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> called it a "hypnotic dance track", and <a href="United%20Press%20International">United Press International</a> noted it was "catchy", characterizing it as a "YouTube sensation". Gil Kaufman of <a href="MTV.com">MTV.com</a> described the piece as "a techno-ripping, demonic dance party". "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's website called the track "hilarious", and "<a href="Nine%20News">Nine News</a>" characterized it as a "raging online success". The director of "Terminator Salvation" <a href="McG">McG</a> liked the remix and put a copy of it on his <a href="iPod">iPod</a>, and Bale said he had heard the remix and thought "they did a good job".

In July 2008, <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a> was filming a scene in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> for the film "<a href="Terminator%20Salvation">Terminator Salvation</a>" with actress <a href="Bryce%20Dallas%20Howard">Bryce Dallas Howard</a>. The film's director of photography, <a href="Shane%20Hurlbut">Shane Hurlbut</a>, walked into Bale's line of sight, and the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at Hurlbut. Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.

The website <a href="TMZ.com">TMZ.com</a> reported the occurrence soon after it happened, and posted an audio recording on February 2, 2009. The event did not become widely publicized until after TMZ.com had posted the audio of Bale's outburst. TMZ.com reported that film executives for "Terminator Salvation" sent a copy of the audio recording to the film's insurance company, in case Bale refused to continue filming.

Four days after the audio recording was posted to the Internet, Bale appeared as a guest on <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> radio station <a href="KROQ-FM">KROQ-FM</a>, where he was asked about the altercation. He said he "acted like a punk", and that he and Hurlbut talked after the conflict and "resolved this completely". Bale acknowledged the two worked together for several hours after the episode, and "at least a month after that", and noted, "I've seen a rough cut of the movie and he has done a wonderful job. It looks fantastic."

Prior to the release of Bale Out, <a href="Lucian%20Piane">Lucian Piane</a> was known for a variety of satirical remixes, including tracks featuring <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Alaska">Alaska Governor</a> <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a>, political commentator <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28political%20commentator%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> during an on-camera outburst in the 1980s, and <a href="Andrew%20Meyer">Andrew Meyer</a>, who received national media attention when he was tasered by police during a speech given by <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a>.

The <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> reported that Piane was "drawn to the musicality of Bale's rage-filled voice". Piane spent three hours working on the remix. "When I heard Christian Bale flip out I had to remix the track. ... It's good to hear that clubs have already started playing it as it is very funny," said Piane. In an interview with "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>", Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: "We're all people in this world. So I figured, [instead of] remembering that one time Christian Bale went crazy on set, maybe people will remember the remix."

The "Bale Out" <a href="Mashup%20%28music%29">mashup</a> incorporates audio clips of Bale lashing out, and Hurlbut responding "I was looking at the lights." The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying "it's fucking distracting", and "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The <a href="sound%20collage">sound collage</a> includes clips of <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does. I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying."

Piane uploaded the piece to MySpace and YouTube on February 2, 2009, hours after the original clip of Bale appeared on the internet. Piane made an <a href="MP3">MP3</a> file of "Bale Out" available as a free download from his MySpace page. "Bale Out" had been viewed over 200,000 times one day after it was uploaded to YouTube, and within two days it had received 700,000 hits. Three days after its posting, "Bale Out" had been viewed over one million times on YouTube, and over 1.5 million times after one week.

In a report on the remix for "<a href="The%20Situation%20Room%20with%20Wolf%20Blitzer">The Situation Room</a>" on <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, correspondent <a href="Brooke%20Anderson">Brooke Anderson</a> noted "... by the looks of this musical parody already posted on YouTube, this infamous rant will be talked about – for a long time to come." <a href="Anderson%20Cooper">Anderson Cooper</a> of "<a href="Anderson%20Cooper%20360%C2%B0">Anderson Cooper 360°</a>" described the RevoLucian remix as "the ballistic Bale boogie". A piece in "<a href="Vue%20Weekly">Vue Weekly</a>" posed the question "what does it all mean in the end when a remixed diatribe by a Hollywood star will get way more hits in a day than any film-criticism site in a year?"

"<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>" reported that <a href="McG">McG</a>, the director of "<a href="Terminator%20Salvation">Terminator Salvation</a>", had a copy of "Bale Out" on his <a href="iPod">iPod</a>. "And I have to admit, that dance remix [on YouTube] is pretty hot," said McG in an interview with "<a href="Fast%20Company%20%28magazine%29">Fast Company</a>". In an interview with "<a href="E%21">E!: Entertainment Television</a>" to discuss "Terminator: Salvation", Christian Bale said he had heard the remix and commented: "It was a good remix; they did a good job." Bale said he had received a remix of his outburst from a friend: "They did a bloody good job! I've gotta say, what a great impulse, you know? To take something ugly like that and make it into a dance? That's a wonderful thing."
The Associated Press described the piece as a "hypnotic dance track", "beat-driven", and a "pulsating tune". The AP noted "Bale has become an unwitting music sensation because of the incident." A "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" blog described "Bale Out" as "a genius piece of mixing by L.A.'s very own RevoLucian", and called the piece a "brilliant" club remix. <a href="MTV.com">MTV.com</a> called it "a techno-ripping, demonic dance party in which Bale's berating is repeated ad nauseam under pictures of the actor and random f-bomb interjections from Barbra Streisand". <a href="United%20Press%20International">United Press International</a> characterized the remix as a "YouTube sensation", calling it "catchy".

"LA Weekly" described the remix as "a mash-up of Bale's best quotes set to a synth-heavy beat", and noted "'Bale Out' turned 'What don't you fuckin' understand?' into one of the year's most addictive choruses and spun a little art out of the debacle." The "<a href="Irish%20Independent">Irish Independent</a>" called the piece a "painstakingly constructed dance track", and described the chorus as "oddly catchy". "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" commented that the remix has "an imperilling beat, a genius comedic flair and more sheer scariness than "American Psycho" and "Terminator" combined". "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" wrote that Piane combined Bale's language with "a driving house music track".

"<a href="TIME">TIME</a>" magazine's website described the piece as "a hilarious YouTube musical remix". "<a href="Nine%20News">Nine News</a>" called RevoLucian's piece a "cheeky remix" and a "raging online success". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" in <a href="London">London</a> highlighted the RevoLucian piece among the "Best of the mash-ups and spoofs" of the Bale outburst, noting he arranged the audio clips from Bale into a "potential dancefloor success". "<a href="Dose%20%28magazine%29">Dose</a>" magazine commented "We've been throwing light-switch raves to the RevoLucian mix all week," and "<a href="BlackBook%20Magazine">BlackBook Magazine</a>" described it as "a brilliant club mix of Bale's meltdown that's bound to scream in your head all day". "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" called the piece "a Hater-worthy techno remix", and "The Celebrity Cafe" commented "Revolucian's remix must have had techno artists everywhere sweating to come up with something half as good, and likely inspired a few outlandish requests by club goers."

<a href="North%20Carolina%20State%20University">North Carolina State University</a> <a href="doctorate">doctoral</a> student Matt Morain commented on the remixes spawned by Bale's rant, in an April 2009 paper on <a href="Internet%20meme">Internet meme</a>s. Morain noted that remixes of Bale's rant received more hits than the rant itself, "What is more surprising than the nearly two million views is that a number of remixes appeared, in response to the clip, which have substantially higher view-counts than the original. In this process of remixing we can clearly see the elements of fantasy theme and rhetorical transmission." <a href="Perez%20Hilton">Perez Hilton</a> commented, "Once again, Lucian Piane has outdone himself! You "must" listen to this." Hilton posted a video to his blog of himself dancing to Piane's remix.

On November 17, 2009, Piane's remix received a nomination for "Best Remix of the Year" by the website "Urlesque". The website's staff noted the Piane remix "spread like wildfire", and became an <a href="Internet%20phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a>.

Economy of the Han dynasty

The <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a> (206 BC – 220 AD) of ancient <a href="China">China</a> experienced contrasting periods of economic prosperity and decline. It is normally divided into three periods: Western Han (206 BC – 9 AD), the <a href="Xin%20dynasty">Xin dynasty</a> (9–23 AD), and Eastern Han (25–220 AD). The Xin regime, established by the former regent <a href="Wang%20Mang">Wang Mang</a>, formed a brief interregnum between lengthy periods of Han rule. Following the fall of Wang Mang, the Han capital was moved eastward from <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a> to <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>. In consequence, historians have named the succeeding eras Western Han and Eastern Han respectively.

The Han economy was defined by significant [population growth], increasing urbanization, unprecedented growth of industry and trade, and government experimentation with <a href="nationalization">nationalization</a>. In this era, the levels of minting and circulation of <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage">coin currency</a> grew significantly, forming the foundation of a stable <a href="monetary%20system">monetary system</a>. The <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> facilitated the establishment of trade and tributary exchanges with <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Imperial%20China">foreign countries</a> across <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, many of which were previously unknown to the <a href="Chinese%20people">people of ancient China</a>. The imperial capitals of both Western Han (Chang'an) and Eastern Han (Luoyang) were among the largest cities in the world at the time, in both population and area. Here, government workshops manufactured furnishings for the <a href="Chinese%20Palaces">palaces</a> of the <a href="Emperor%20of%20China">emperor</a> and produced goods for the common people. The government oversaw the construction of roads and bridges, which facilitated official government business and encouraged commercial growth. Under Han rule, industrialists, wholesalers, and merchants—from minor shopkeepers to wealthy businessmen—could engage in a wide range of enterprises and trade in the domestic, public, and even military spheres.

In the early Han period, rural peasant farmers were largely self-sufficient, but they began to rely heavily upon commercial exchanges with the wealthy landowners of large agricultural estates. Many peasants subsequently fell into debt and were forced to become either hired laborers or rent-paying <a href="Tenant%20farmer">tenants</a> of the land-owning classes. The Han government continually strove to provide economic aid to poor farmers, who had to compete with powerful and influential <a href="Four%20occupations">nobles, landowners, and merchants</a>. The government tried to limit the power of these wealthy groups through heavy taxation and bureaucratic regulation. <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu's</a> (r. 141–87 BC) government even nationalized the iron and salt industries; however, these government monopolies were abolished during Eastern Han. Increasing government intervention in the private economy during the late 2nd century BC severely weakened the commercial merchant class. This allowed wealthy landowners to increase their power and to ensure the continuation of an agrarian-dominated economy. The wealthy landlords eventually dominated commercial activities as well, maintaining control over the rural peasants—upon whom the government relied for tax revenues, <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">military manpower</a>, and public works labor. By the 180s AD, economic and political crises had caused the Han government to become heavily decentralized, while the great landowners became increasingly independent and powerful in their communities.

During the <a href="Warring%20States%20period">Warring States period</a> (403–221 BC), the development of private commerce, new trade routes, handicraft industries, and <a href="Chinese%20currency">a money economy</a> led to the growth of new urban centers. These centers were markedly different from the older cities, which had merely served as power bases for the <a href="Chinese%20nobility">nobility</a>. The use of a standardized, nationwide currency during the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> (221–206 BC) facilitated long-distance trade between cities. Many Han cities grew large: the Western Han capital, <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a>, had approximately 250,000 inhabitants, while the Eastern Han capital, <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>, had approximately 500,000 inhabitants. The population of the Han Empire, recorded in the tax <a href="census">census</a> of 2 AD, was 57.6 million people in 12,366,470 households. The majority of commoners who populated the cities lived in extended urban and suburban areas outside the <a href="Chinese%20city%20wall">city walls</a> and <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a>s. The total urban area of Western-Han Chang'an—including the extensions outside the walls—was . The total urban area of Eastern-Han Luoyang—including the extensions outside the walls—was . Both Chang'an and Luoyang had two prominent marketplaces; each market had a two-story government office demarcated by a flag and drum at the top. Market officials were charged with maintaining order, collecting commercial taxes, setting standard commodity prices on a monthly basis, and authorizing contracts between merchants and customers.

During the early Western Han period, founding <a href="Emperor%20Gaozu%20of%20Han">Emperor Gaozu of Han</a> (r. 202–195 BC) closed government <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">mints</a> in favor of <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage">coin currency</a> produced by the <a href="private%20sector">private sector</a>. Gaozu's widow <a href="Empress%20L%C3%BC%20Zhi">Empress Lü Zhi</a>, as <a href="grand%20empress%20dowager">grand empress dowager</a>, abolished private minting in 186 BC. She first issued a government-minted bronze coin weighing , but issued another, weighing , in 182 BC. The change to the lighter coin caused widespread inflation, so in 175 BC <a href="Emperor%20Wen%20of%20Han">Emperor Wen of Han</a> (r. 180–157 BC) lifted the ban on private minting; private mints were required to mint coins weighing exactly . Private minting was again abolished in 144 BC during the end of <a href="Emperor%20Jing%20of%20Han">Emperor Jing of Han</a>'s (r. 157–141 BC) reign. Despite this, the bronze coin was issued by both central and local <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commandery</a> governments until 120 BC, when for one year it was replaced with a coin weighing . Other currencies were introduced around this time. <a href="Token%20money">Token money</a> notes made of embroidered white deerskin, with a face value of 400,000 coins, were used to collect government revenues. Emperor Wu also introduced three tin-silver alloy coins worth 3,000, 500, and 300 bronze coins, respectively; all of these weighed less than .

In 119 BC, the government issued the bronze "wushu" (五銖) coin weighing ; the coin remained the standard currency in China until the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907 AD). During the brief interruptive <a href="Xin%20dynasty">Xin dynasty</a> (9–23 AD) of <a href="Wang%20Mang">Wang Mang</a> (45 BC – 23 AD), the government introduced several new denominations in 7, 9, 10, and 14 AD. These new units (including bronze <a href="knife%20money">knife money</a>, gold, silver, tortoise, and cowry shell currencies) often had a market price unequal to their weight and debased the value of coin currency. Once the widespread civil wars following Wang's overthrow abated, the "wushu" coin was reintroduced by <a href="Emperor%20Guangwu%20of%20Han">Emperor Guangwu of Han</a> (r. 25–57 AD) in 40 AD at the instigation of <a href="Ma%20Yuan%20%28Han%20dynasty%29">Ma Yuan</a> (14 BC – 49 AD). Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed all commandery mints in 113 BC and granted the central government's <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Superintendent%20of%20Waterways%20and%20Parks">Superintendent of Waterways and Parks</a> the exclusive right to mint coins. Although the issue of central government coinage was transferred to the office of the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Minister%20of%20Finance">Minister of Finance</a> (one of <a href="Nine%20Ministers">Nine Ministers</a> of the central government) by the beginning of Eastern Han, the central government's monopoly over the issue of coinage persisted.
Gary Lee Todd (Ph.D. in History from <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> and Professor of History at <a href="Sias%20International%20University">Sias International University</a> in <a href="Xinzheng">Xinzheng</a>, Henan, China) provides the following images of coins issued during the Western Han and Xin periods on his website:

<a href="Four%20occupations">Merchants and peasant farmers</a> paid property and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with a portion of their crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets. The Han government may have found collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.

From 118 BC to 5 AD, the government minted over 28,000,000,000 coins, with an annual average of 220,000,000 coins minted (or 220,000 strings of 1,000 coins). In comparison, the <a href="Chinese%20era%20name">Tianbao period</a> (天寶) (742–755 AD) of the Tang dynasty produced 327,000,000 coins every year while 3,000,000,000 coins in 1045 AD and 5,860,000,000 coins in 1080 AD were made in the <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> (960–1279 AD). Coin cash became the common measure of wealth during Eastern Han, as many wages were paid solely in cash. Diwu Lun (第五倫) (<a href="floruit">fl.</a> 40–85 AD), Governor of Shu Province (modern <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a>), described his subordinate officials' wealth not in terms of landholdings, but in the form of aggregate properties worth approximately 10,000,000 coin cash. Commercial transactions involving hundreds of thousands of coins were commonplace.

<a href="Angus%20Maddison">Angus Maddison</a> estimates that the country's <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">United States dollar</a>s—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did not significantly change until the beginning of the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist <a href="Joseph%20Needham">Joseph Needham</a> has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, confiscations, and price regulation schemes.

After <a href="Shang%20Yang">Shang Yang</a> (d. 338 BC) of the <a href="Qin%20%28state%29">State of Qin</a> abolished the communal and aristocratic <a href="well-field%20system">well-field system</a> in an effort to curb the power of nobles, land in China could be bought and sold. Historical scholars of the Han dynasty like <a href="Dong%20Zhongshu">Dong Zhongshu</a> (179–104 BC) attributed the rise of the wealthy landowning class to this reform. The "<a href="Han%20Feizi%20%28book%29">Han Feizi</a>" describes these landowners' use of hired labor in agriculture, a practice dating back to the 3rd century BC, possibly earlier. Some landowners owned small numbers of slaves, but many relied on peasant tenant farmers who paid rent with a portion of their agricultural produce. More numerous than tenants, small landowner-cultivators lived and worked independently, but often fell into debt and sold their land to the wealthy. The court official <a href="Chao%20Cuo">Chao Cuo</a> (d. 154 BC) argued that if the average independent landowning family of five could cultivate no more than of land and produce no more than of grain annually, then natural disasters and high taxation rates would force many into debt, to sell their land, homes, and even children, and to become dependent upon work as tenant farmers for the wealthy.

Officials at the court of <a href="Emperor%20Ai%20of%20Han">Emperor Ai of Han</a> (r. 7–1 BC) attempted to implement reforms limiting the amount of land nobles and wealthy landowners could own legally, but were unsuccessful. When <a href="Wang%20Mang">Wang Mang</a> took control of the government in 9 AD, he abolished the purchase and sale of land in a system called King's Fields (王田). This was a variation of the well-field system, where the government owned the land and assured every peasant an equal share to cultivate. Within three years, complaints from wealthy landowners and nobles forced Wang Mang to repeal the reform. After <a href="Gengshi%20Emperor">Gengshi</a> (r. 23–25 AD) and <a href="Emperor%20Guangwu%20of%20Han">Guangwu</a> (r. 25–57 AD) restored the Han dynasty, they relied on the service of great landholding families to secure their position in society. Many of their government officials also became wealthy landowners.

By the late Eastern Han period, the peasantry had become largely landless and served wealthy landowners. This cost the government significant tax revenue. Although the central government under <a href="Emperor%20He%20of%20Han">Emperor He of Han</a> (r. 88–105 AD) reduced taxes in times of natural disaster and distress without much effect upon the treasury, successive rulers became less able to cope with major crises. The government soon relied upon local administrations to conduct relief efforts. After the central government failed to provide local governments with provisions during both a locust swarm and the flooding of the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a> in 153 AD, many landless peasants became <a href="Retainer%20agreement">retainer</a>s of large landowners in exchange for aid. Patricia Ebrey writes that the Eastern Han was the "transitional period" between the Western Han—when small independent farmers were the vast majority—and the <a href="Three%20Kingdoms">Three Kingdoms</a> (220–265 AD) and later <a href="Sixteen%20Kingdoms">Sixteen Kingdoms</a> (304–439 AD), when large family estates used <a href="Serfdom">unfree labor</a>.

The <a href="Yellow%20Turban%20Rebellion">Yellow Turban Rebellion</a> of 184 AD, the <a href="Ten%20Attendants">slaughter of the eunuchs</a> in 189 AD, and the <a href="campaign%20against%20Dong%20Zhuo">campaign against Dong Zhuo</a> in 190 AD destabilized the central government, and <a href="History%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">Luoyang was burnt to the ground</a>. At this point, "... private and local power came to replace public authority."

The Han <a href="Chancellor">Chancellor</a> and <a href="Cao%20Wei">King of Wei</a> <a href="Cao%20Cao">Cao Cao</a> (155–220 AD) made the final significant attempt to limit the power of wealthy landowners. Cao Cao established government-managed <a href="Tuntian">agricultural colonies</a> for landless commoners; in exchange for land and cheap equipment, the farmers paid a portion of their crop yield. In the 120s BC, Emperor Wu had attempted to establish agricultural colonies in the northwestern frontier of the newly conquered <a href="Hexi%20Corridor">Hexi Corridor</a> (in modern <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a>). 600,000 new settlers farmed on these state lands using seeds, draft animals and equipment loaned by the government. An imperial edict in 85 AD ordered the local governments of commanderies and <a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">subordinate kingdoms</a> to resettle landless peasants onto state-owned lands, where they would be paid wages, provided with crop seeds, loaned farming tools and exempted from rent payments for five years and poll taxes for three years. The edict also allowed peasants to return to their native <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%23History">counties</a> at any time. Subsequent governments of the Three Kingdoms established agricultural colonies on these models.

Many scholars claim that Han farmers were generally living at subsistence levels, relying primarily on two documents from the "<a href="Book%20of%20Han">Hanshu</a>" ("Book of Han"). The first is attributed to the Warring States minister <a href="Li%20Kui%20%28legalist%29">Li Kui</a> 李悝 (455-395 BCE); the second is a memorial written by the Han-era official <a href="Chao%20Cuo">Chao Cuo</a> 晁錯 (200-154 BCE). Both appear in <a href="https%3A//zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%25E6%25BC%25A2%25E6%259B%25B8/%25E5%258D%25B7024%25E4%25B8%258A">"Hanshu" Chapter 24</a>, the "Treatise on Food and Money" 食貨志. Li Kui and Chao Cuo both emphasize the extreme precariousness of Han agricultural life, a view summed up by Cho-yun Hsu, who writes that Han and pre-Han farmers had only "a relatively small margin left to meet other expenses": "An account of the income and expenditures of a small farm in the pre-Ch’in (Chan-kuo) period cited in the Han-shu gives a deficit of 10 percent of the annual income, presumably in a year of mediocre crops… In the time of [Chao Cuo] the situation remained very much the same."

According to Hans Bielenstein, the physical requirements of subsistence in grain can also be calculated from the "Hanshu": "a family consisting of an old woman, a grown man, a grown woman, an older child, and a younger child, annually consumed 127 "hu" of unhusked grain. This comes to about 10.5 "hu" per month." (According to Swann, one "hu" 斛 equals 0.565 of a US bushel, which is about 5 gallons or 20 liters). Hsu puts the yearly subsistence figure at 140 "hu". Bielenstein also examines salary tables given in both the "Hanshu" and the "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Later%20Han">Houhan shu</a>" ("Book of the Later Han") that list official salaries half in cash and half in unhusked grain. Based on these tables, he derives a conversion between cash and "hu": a "generally accepted average is 70 to 80 cash for Former Han and 100 cash for Later Han." Based on this conversion, the cash value of the grain needed for subsistence was about 8,890 to 14,000 coins per year during the Han dynasty.

We can also estimate the amount of land needed to produce this amount of grain, thanks to Wolfram Eberhard who "estimates the average yield as being 1.0 to 1.5 "shih" per mu," though Hsu notes that, "Very high yields could reach as much as 6.4 "hu" per "mu"." Swann gives 1 shi 石 (which she translates as "picul" with a weight of "64 lbs. 8.8 oz.") as between 1 and 2 "hu", depending on the type of grain. Based only on Eberhard’s yields and Swann’s range of conversion between "shi" and "hu", a farmer would need between about 85 and 254 "mu" (between about 9.7 and 29 acres) in order to produce the 127 "hu" of grain Eberhard deems necessary to the subsistence of a family of five. Other scholars give other numbers, however. Hsu claims that 50 "mu" (about 5.7 acres) was in fact "the acreage needed for subsistence living," while Wang Zhongshu calculates that "there was on the average 24.6 mou per family, or less than 6 mou per person (with each mou equivalent to 456 square m)." Both Li Kui and Chao Cuo claimed that 100 "mu" was the amount of land required to support a family, though it should be noted that the amount of land denoted by the word "mu" had changed between Li Kui's time and Chao Cuo's.

Because small landowning families represented the mainstay of the Han tax base, the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and to limit the power of wealthy landlords and merchants. The government reduced taxes in times of poor harvest and provided relief after disasters. <a href="Tax%20break">Tax remission</a>s and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants to return to their land. An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms. The <a href="Land%20value%20tax">land tax</a> on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one-fifteenth of crop yield to one-thirtieth, and abolished in 167 BC. However, the tax was reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one-thirtieth. At the beginning of the Eastern Han, the land tax rate was one-tenth of the crop yield, but following the stabilization following Wang Mang's death, the rate was reduced to the original one-thirtieth in 30 AD.

Towards the end of the Han dynasty, the land tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by increasing the <a href="Tax%20per%20head">poll</a> and property tax rates. The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Yuan%20of%20Han">Emperor Yuan of Han</a> (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian <a href="Charles%20Hucker">Charles Hucker</a> writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.

Though requiring additional revenue to fund the <a href="Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu%20War">Han–Xiongnu War</a>, the government during <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu of Han</a>'s reign (141–87 BC) sought to avoid heavy taxation of small landowners. To increase revenue, the government imposed heavier taxes on merchants, confiscated land from nobles, sold offices and titles, and established government <a href="monopoly">monopolies</a> over the minting of coins, <a href="History%20of%20ferrous%20metallurgy">iron manufacture</a> and salt mining. New taxes were imposed on the ownership of boats, carts, carriages, wheelbarrows, shops and other properties. The overall property tax for merchants was raised in 119 BC from 120 coins for every 10,000 coins-worth of property owned to 120 coins for every 2,000 coins-worth of property owned. Tax rates for almost all commodities are unknown, except for that of <a href="Chinese%20alcoholic%20beverages">liquor</a>. After the government monopoly on liquor was abolished in 81 BC, a property tax of 2 coins for every was levied on liquor merchants.

The sale of certain offices and titles was reintroduced in Eastern Han by <a href="Empress%20Deng%20Sui">Empress Dowager Deng Sui</a>—who reigned as <a href="regent">regent</a> from 105–121 AD—to raise government revenues in times of severe natural disasters and the widespread rebellion of the <a href="Qiang%20people">Qiang people</a> in <a href="western%20China">western China</a>. The sale of offices became extremely corrupt under the <a href="Eunuch%20%28court%20official%29">eunuch</a>-dominated government of <a href="Emperor%20Ling%20of%20Han">Emperor Ling of Han</a> (r. 168–189 AD), when many top official posts were sold at the highest bidder instead of being filled by vetted candidates who had taken <a href="Imperial%20examinations">Imperial examinations</a> or attended the <a href="Taixue">Imperial University</a>.

Two forms of mass <a href="conscription">conscription</a> existed during the Han period. These were civilian conscription ("gengzu" 更卒) and military conscription ("zhengzu" 正卒). In addition to paying their monetary and crop taxes, all peasants of the Western Han period aged between fifteen and fifty-six were required to undertake mandatory conscription duties for one month of each year. These duties were usually fulfilled by work on construction projects.

At the age of twenty-three years male peasants were drafted to serve in <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">the military</a>, where they were assigned to <a href="infantry">infantry</a>, <a href="Horses%20in%20East%20Asian%20warfare">cavalry</a>, or <a href="Naval%20history%20of%20China">navy</a> service. After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city. They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six. This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local <a href="militia">militia</a>s, which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service. These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army ("Nanjun" 南軍), while the Northern Army ("Beijun" 北軍) was a <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> composed of paid career soldiers.

During the Eastern Han, peasants could avoid the month of annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in commutation ("gengfu" 更賦). This development went hand in hand with the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.

There were two categories of Han merchants: those who sold goods at shops in urban markets, and the larger-scale itinerant traders who traveled between cities and to foreign countries. The small-scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register and had to pay heavy commercial taxes. Although these registered merchants were taxed, an edict of 94 AD ordered that landless peasants who had to resort to peddling were to be exempted from taxation.

Itinerant merchants were often wealthy and did not have to register. These itinerant merchants often participated in large-scale trade with powerful families and officials. Nishijima writes that most of the biographies of "wealthy men" in the "<a href="Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian">Records of the Grand Historian</a>" and "<a href="Book%20of%20Han">Book of Han</a>" were those of itinerant merchants.

In contrast, registered marketplace merchants had a very low social status and were often subject to additional restrictions. Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes, forbidding merchants from wearing silk, and barring their descendants from holding <a href="Civil%20service">public office</a>. These laws were difficult to enforce. Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and unregistered merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants were not allowed to own land, if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated. However, wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land. Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace, where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes.

At the beginning of the Han dynasty, <a href="Salt%20in%20Chinese%20history%23Ancient%20China%20and%20the%20early%20empire">China's salt and iron enterprises</a> were privately owned by a number of wealthy merchants and <a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">subordinate regional kings</a>. The profits of these industries rivaled the funds of the imperial court. A successful iron or salt industrialist might have employed over a thousand peasants, causing a severe loss of agricultural tax revenue to the central government. To restrict the power of the industrialists, Emperor Wu had <a href="Nationalization">nationalized</a> the salt and iron industries by 117 BC.

The government also instituted a liquor monopoly in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC in an effort to reduce government intervention in the private economy.

The Reformist Party supported privatization, opposing the Modernist Party, which had dominated politics during the reign of Emperor Wu and the subsequent <a href="regent">regency</a> of <a href="Huo%20Guang">Huo Guang</a> (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued that state monopolies provided abundant raw materials, good working conditions, and high quality iron; the Reformists countered that state-owned ironworks produced large and impractical implements designed to meet <a href="quota%20share">quota</a>s rather than to be of practical use, were of inferior quality, and were too expensive for commoners to purchase. In 44 BC, the Reformists had both the salt and iron monopolies abolished, but the monopolies were reinstated in 41 BC after their abrupt closure resulted in significant losses of revenue for the government and disruption of the private economy.

Wang Mang preserved these central government monopolies. When Eastern Han began, they were once again repealed, the industries given to local commandery governments and private entrepreneurs. <a href="Emperor%20Zhang%20of%20Han">Emperor Zhang of Han</a> (r. 75–88 AD) briefly reintroduced the central government monopolies on salt and iron from 85 to 88 AD, but abolished them in the last year of his reign. After Emperor Zhang, the Han never returned the salt and iron industries to government ownership.

The grain trade was a profitable private enterprise during the early Western Han, yet Emperor Wu's government intervened in the grain trade when it established the "equable marketing system" (also known as the "<a href="ever-normal%20granary">ever-normal granary</a> system") in 110 BC. The government purchased grain when it was plentiful and inexpensive, shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where grain was scarce. The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation, to create a standard price and to increase government revenue. The system was designed by civil servant <a href="Sang%20Hongyang">Sang Hongyang</a> (d. 80 BC)—who was previously a merchant. Sang Hongyang was criticized by merchants for placing government officials in market stalls. This supply system was discontinued in Eastern Han, although it was briefly revived by <a href="Emperor%20Ming%20of%20Han">Emperor Ming of Han</a> (r. 57–75). Emperor Ming also abolished the system in 68 AD, when he believed that the government's storage of grain increased prices and made wealthy landowners richer.

Ebrey argues that although most of Emperor Wu's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han, their damage to the merchant class and the subsequent <a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries. The Eastern Han central government lost an important source of revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers. However, this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on the merchants.

Han government workshops produced common, luxury, and even artistic funerary items, such as the ceramic figurines and tomb tiles which adorned the walls of underground tombs. Imperial workshops were operated by the Minister Steward, whose ministry controlled the treasury and the emperor's private finances.

The "Office of Arts and Crafts", subordinate to the Minister Steward, produced weapons, <a href="TLV%20mirror">bronze mirrors</a>, vessel wares, and other goods. "The Office of Manufactures", also subordinate to the Minister Steward, made the cheaper weapons, utensils, and <a href="Chinese%20armour">armor</a>. Textiles and <a href="Han%20Chinese%20clothing">clothing</a> worn by the emperor and royal family were made in the "Weaving House of the West" and "Weaving House of the East"; the latter was abolished in 28 BC, and the "Weaving House of the West" was renamed the "Weaving House".

Workshops located in the commanderies made silks and embroidered fabrics, silver and gold luxury items, and weapons. One workshop, in modern <a href="Anhui">Anhui</a> province, had a shipyard where battle ships were built. Although the government used the labor of state-owned slaves, corvée laborers, and convicts in its workshops, they also hired <a href="Master%20craftsman">skilled craftsmen</a> who were well-paid.

Han <a href="lacquerware">lacquerware</a>s were privately made as well as being manufactured in government workshops. Hundreds of laborers could be employed to work on a single luxury item, such as a <a href="lacquer">lacquer</a>ed cup or screen. Some lacquerwares were inscribed simply with the <a href="Chinese%20surname">clan name</a> of the family who owned them. Others were inscribed with the titles of the owner, the specific type of the vessels, their capacities, the precise day, month, and year of manufacture (according to <a href="Chinese%20era%20name">Chinese era name</a>s and their <a href="Chinese%20calendar">lunisolar calendar</a>), the names of the floor managers who oversaw the items' production and the names of the workers who made them. Even some iron implements made during the age of the monopoly bore inscriptions of the date they were made and the name of the workshop. Bronze calipers from the <a href="Xin%20dynasty">Xin dynasty</a>, used for minute measurements, had an inscription stating that it was "made on a "gui-you" day at new moon of the first month of the first year of the Shijian guo period." The calipers date from 9 AD. Han lacquerwares bearing the <a href="Seal%20%28East%20Asia%29">imperial mark</a> of the emperor have been found far beyond the Han capital regions by modern archaeologists, in places such as <a href="Qingzhen">Qingzhen</a> (in <a href="Guizhou">Guizhou</a>), <a href="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a> (in <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>), and <a href="Noin-Ula%20kurgans">Noin Ula</a> (in <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>).

The Court Architect was charged by central government with overseeing all <a href="Chinese%20architecture">imperial construction and public works projects</a>, including the building of palaces and tombs.
During the Western Han period, conscripted peasants were organized into work teams consisting of over a hundred thousand laborers. About 150,000 conscripted workers, serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over a total of five years, worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang'an, which were completed in 190 BC. Conscript laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various <a href="Chinese%20folk%20religion">deities</a> and the <a href="Ancestor%20worship">spirits of the emperor's ancestors</a>. Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport and irrigation. Some of the larger Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the <a href="Dujiangyan%20Irrigation%20System">Dujiangyan Irrigation System</a> and <a href="Zhengguo%20Canal">Zhengguo Canal</a>, built by the previous State of Qin and <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> (221–206 BC), respectively.

Nineteen stone inscriptions survive commemorating the building of new roads and bridges by the Eastern Han government. Archaeological excavations at Chang'an show that wooden bridges were built over the defensive moat and led to the gatehouses. Roadways also needed periodic repairs; in 63 AD the route leading from the <a href="Qilian%20Mountains">Qilian Mountains</a>, through <a href="Hanzhong">Hanzhong</a> (modern southern <a href="Shanxi">Shanxi</a>), and towards the capital Luoyang underwent major repairs. For this project, 623 <a href="trestle">trestle</a> bridges, five large bridges, 107 km (66 mi) of new roadways, and 64 buildings—including <a href="Inn">rest houses</a>, <a href="mail">post stations</a>, and <a href="courier">relay stations</a>—were built. Those commissioned with military authority also built bridges. For example, during his <a href="Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu%20War">campaign against the Xiongnu</a> in the <a href="Ordos%20Desert">Ordos Desert</a> in 127 BC, the general <a href="Wei%20Qing">Wei Qing</a> (d. 106 BC) had a new bridge built over the Wujia River (a former tributary of the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a>) in today's <a href="Inner%20Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a>. He used this bridge to move troops and supplies for an attack on the Xiongnu, northwest of modern Wuyuan County (五原县). Ebrey writes:

There were, of course, numerous reasons for maintaining roads. A unified political system could be maintained only as long as the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed. Such a system of transportation, once established, facilitated commerce. At the local level, road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials.

Han-era historians like <a href="Sima%20Qian">Sima Qian</a> (145–86 BC) and <a href="Ban%20Gu">Ban Gu</a> (32–92 AD), as well as the later historian <a href="Fan%20Ye%20%28historian%29">Fan Ye</a> (398–445 AD), recorded details of the business transactions and products traded by Han merchants. Evidence of these products has also emerged from archaeological investigations.

The main agricultural staple foods during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including glutinous rice), wheat, beans, and barley. Other food items included sorghum, taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including "<a href="Prunus%20salicina">Prunus salicina</a>" and "<a href="Prunus%20mume">Prunus mume</a>"), peach, apricot, and <a href="myrica">myrica</a>. Chicken, duck, goose, beef, pork, rabbit, <a href="sika%20deer">sika deer</a>, turtle dove, owl, <a href="Chinese%20bamboo%20partridge">Chinese bamboo partridge</a>, magpie, common pheasant, crane, and various types of fish were commonly consumed meats.

The production of silk through <a href="sericulture">sericulture</a> was profitable for both small-time farmers and large-scale producers. Silk clothing was too expensive for the poor, who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp. The rural women usually wove all the family's clothes.

Common bronze items included domestic wares like oil lamps, incense burners, tables, irons, stoves, and dripping jars. Iron goods were often used for construction and farmwork, such as plowshares, pickaxes, spades, shovels, hoes, sickles, axes, <a href="adze">adze</a>, hammers, chisels, knives, saws, <a href="scratch%20awl">scratch awl</a>s, and nails. Iron was also used to make <a href="Chinese%20swords">swords</a>, <a href="ji%20%28halberd%29">halberds</a>, arrowheads and <a href="scale%20armor">scale armor</a> for the military.

Other common goods included: consumables (liquor, pickles and sauces, sheep and pigs, grain, yeast for fermentation, bean relish, dried fish and abalone, dates, chestnuts, fruits and vegetables), raw materials (cattle hide, boat timber, bamboo poles, dyes, horns, cinnabar, raw lacquer, jade, amber), clothing and clothing materials (silk fabrics, fine and coarse cloth, sable and foxskin garments, felt and mats, deerskin slippers), eating utensils (bronze utensils and chopsticks, silver, wood and iron vessels, ceramic wares), art objects (lacquerware, ceramics), elegant coffins (made of catalpa, <a href="Robinia%20pseudoacacia">locust</a>, juniper, and lacquered wood), vehicles such as light two-wheeled carts and heavy oxcarts, and horses.

In addition to general commodities, Han historians list the goods of specific regions. Common trade items from the region of modern <a href="Shanxi">Shanxi</a> included bamboo, timber, grain, and gemstones; <a href="Shandong">Shandong</a> had fish, salt, liquor, and silk; <a href="Jiangnan">Jiangnan</a> had <a href="camphor">camphor</a>, catalpa, ginger, cinnamon, gold, tin, lead, cinnabar, rhinoceros horn, tortoise shell, pearls, ivory, and leather. Ebrey lists items found in a 2nd-century AD tomb in <a href="Wuwei%2C%20Gansu">Wuwei, Gansu</a> (along the <a href="Hexi%20Corridor">Hexi Corridor</a> fortified by the <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall of China</a>), evidence that luxury items could be obtained even in remote frontiers.

... fourteen pieces of pottery; wooden objects such as a horse, pig, ox, chicken, chicken coop, and a single-horned animal; seventy copper cash; a crossbow mechanism made of bronze; a writing brush; a lacquer-encased inkstone; a lacquer tray and bowl; a wooden comb; a jade ornament; a pair of hemp shoes; a straw bag; the remains of an inscribed banner; a bamboo hairpin; two straw satchels; and a stone lamp.

In the early Eastern Han, Emperor Ming passed laws which prohibited those involved in agriculture from simultaneously engaging in mercantile trade. These laws were largely ineffective, since wealthy landowners and landlords made significant profits from the trading of goods produced on their estates. Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 AD), a local commandery administrator who later served as an official in the central government's secretariat, started a winery business in his home to pay for his father's funeral. His fellow <a href="Gentry%20%28China%29">gentry</a> criticized him, claiming the practice was immoral, but not illegal.

Cui Shi's book "Sìmín yuèlìng" (四民月令) is the only significant surviving work on <a href="Agriculture%20in%20China">agriculture</a> from the Eastern Han period, though about 3,000 <a href="Chinese%20character">written characters</a> of the "Fan Shengzhi shu" (氾勝之書), dated to the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Cheng%20of%20Han">Emperor Cheng of Han</a> (33–7 BC), still survive. Cui Shi's book provides descriptions of rituals for <a href="ancestor%20worship">ancestor worship</a>, festival and religious <a href="Traditional%20Chinese%20holidays">holiday celebrations</a>, conduct for <a href="Chinese%20kinship">family and kinship relations</a>, farmwork, and the schooling season for boys. Cui Shi's book also provides detailed instructions on which months were the most profitable times to buy and sell certain types of farm-produced goods.

The following table is modelled on Ebrey's "Estate and Family Management in the Later Han as Seen in the Monthly Instructions for the Four Classes of People" (1974). Ebrey writes: "... the same item was often bought and sold at different times of the year. The rationale for this is very clearly financial: items were bought when the price was low and sold when it was high." The specific amounts for each commodity traded are not listed, yet the timing of sale and purchase during the year is the most valuable information for historians. Missing from Cui Shi's list are important items which his family certainly bought and sold at specific times of the year, such as salt, iron farm tools and kitchen utensils, paper and ink (the <a href="papermaking">papermaking</a> process was invented by <a href="Cai%20Lun">Cai Lun</a> in 105 AD), as well as luxury items of silk and exotic foods.

There was mass unemployment among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period. However, archaeological and literary evidence shows that those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably. In addition to Cui's work, the <a href="List%20of%20Chinese%20inventions">inventor</a>, <a href="Chinese%20mathematics">mathematician</a>, and <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">court astronomer</a> <a href="Zhang%20Heng">Zhang Heng</a> (78–139 AD) wrote a <a href="Fu%20%28poetry%29">rhapsody</a> describing the rich countryside of <a href="Nanyang%2C%20Henan">Nanyang</a> and its <a href="Paddy%20field">irrigated rice paddies</a>. He mentions grain fields, ponds filled with fish, and <a href="Chinese%20garden">estate gardens</a> and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, <a href="perilla">perilla</a>, <a href="Tetradium">evodia</a>, and purple ginger.

Bricks lining the walls of the tombs of wealthy Han were adorned with carved or molded reliefs and painted murals; these often showed scenes of the tomb occupant's estate, halls, wells, carriage sheds, pens for cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs, stables for horses, and employed workers picking <a href="Morus%20%28plant%29">mulberry leaves</a>, plowing crop fields, and hoeing vegetable patches.

Small and medium-sized estates were managed by single families. The father acted as the head manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked with female servants to weave cloth and produce silk. Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a <a href="sharecropping">sharecropping</a> system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands. Under this system, peasants would receive land, tools, oxen, and a house in exchange for a third or a half of their crop yield.

Prior to the Han dynasty, markets close to China's northern border engaged in trade with the nomadic tribes of the eastern <a href="Eurasian%20Steppe">Eurasian Steppe</a>. The <a href="heqin">heqin</a> agreement between the Han and nomadic <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> stipulated the transfer of tributary goods from China. The exact amount of annual tribute sent to the Xiongnu in the 2nd century BC is unknown. In 89 BC, when Hulugu Chanyu (狐鹿姑) (r. 95–85 BC) requested a renewal of the heqin agreement, he demanded an annual tribute of or 10,000 "dan" of wine, or 5,000 "hu" of grain, and 10,000 bales of silk. These amounts of wine, grain, and silk were considered to be a significant increase from earlier amounts of tribute, which must have been much less. Besides these arrangements, the most common commercial exchanges between the <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> and Han merchants consisted of the trading of Xiongnu horses and <a href="Fur%20clothing">furs</a> for Han agricultural foodstuffs and luxury items, most notably silk. By means of the <a href="black%20market">black market</a>, the Xiongnu were also able to smuggle Han <a href="History%20of%20ferrous%20metallurgy">iron weapons</a> across the border.

The Han established a diplomatic presence in the <a href="Tarim%20Basin">Tarim Basin</a> of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> during <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu of Han</a>'s reign (141–87 BC). Han envoys brought gifts of sheep, gold, and silk to the urban oasis city-states. The Chinese sometimes used gold as currency; however, silk was favored as a means to pay for food and lodging. Once the Han had subjugated the Tarim Basin and <a href="Protectorate%20of%20the%20Western%20Regions">established a Protectorate there</a>, Han envoys in these states were given free food and lodging. These envoys were required to send tributary items of furs, precious stones, and delicacies such as Central Asian raisins to the Han court. The <a href="Arsacid%20Empire">Arsacid</a> court sent exotic animals including lions and ostriches to the Han court, and a king ruling in what is now <a href="Burma">Burma</a> sent elephants and rhinoceroses. Han diplomatic missions to royal courts across Asia were usually accompanied by trade caravans which earned substantial profits.

The Han court received tributary submission from the Xiongnu <a href="chanyu">leader</a> Huhanye (呼韓邪) (r. 58–31 BC), an important rival to <a href="Zhizhi%20Chanyu">Zhizhi Chanyu</a> (r. 56–36 BC, died at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zhizhi">Battle of Zhizhi</a>). Huhanye's tribute, exchange of hostages, and presence at Chang'an in the <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">New Year</a> of 51 BC were rewarded with the following gifts from the emperor: of gold, 200,000 coins, 77 suits of clothes, 8,000 bales of silk fabric, of silk floss, 15 horses, and of grain. However, this is the only occurrence of rewarded gifts that present materials other than fabric. As shown in the table below, based upon Yü Ying-shih's "Han Foreign Relations" (1986), the gifts consisted only silk after 51 BC, and the Xiongnu leader's political submission was guaranteed only for as long as the Han could provide him with ever-greater amounts of imperial largesse of silk with each succeeding visit to the Chinese court.

The establishment of the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> occurred during Wu's reign, owing to the efforts of the diplomat <a href="Zhang%20Qian">Zhang Qian</a>. The increased demand for silk from the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> stimulated commercial traffic in both Central Asia and across the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. <a href="Roman%20commerce">Roman merchants</a> sailed to <a href="Barbarikon">Barbarikon</a> near present-day <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and <a href="Bharuch">Barygaza</a> in present-day <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, <a href="India">India</a> to purchase Chinese silks (see <a href="Roman%20trade%20with%20India">Roman trade with India</a>). When Emperor Wu conquered <a href="Nanyue">Nanyue</a>—in what is now <a href="Southwest%20China">Southwest China</a> and <a href="Northern%20and%20southern%20Vietnam">northern Vietnam</a>—in 111 BC, overseas trade was extended to <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and the Indian Ocean, as maritime merchants traded Han gold and silk for pearls, jade, lapis lazuli, and glasswares.

The <a href="Book%20of%20Later%20Han">Book of Later Han</a> states that Roman envoys sent by Emperor <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> (r. 161–180 AD), following a southern route, brought gifts to the court of <a href="Emperor%20Huan%20of%20Han">Emperor Huan of Han</a> (r. 146–168 AD) in 166 AD. This Roman mission followed an unsuccessful attempt by the Han diplomat <a href="Gan%20Ying">Gan Ying</a> to reach <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in 97. Gan Ying was delayed at the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, by <a href="Arsacid%20Empire">Arsacid</a> authorities, and could only make a report on Rome based on oral accounts. Historians <a href="Charles%20Hucker">Charles Hucker</a> and <a href="Rafe%20de%20Crespigny">Rafe de Crespigny</a> both speculate that the Roman mission of 166 AD involved enterprising Roman merchants instead of actual diplomats; Hucker writes:

Tributary missions from vassal states were commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities to do business in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status at all.

Gregorian mission

The Gregorian mission or Augustinian mission was a <a href="Christian%20mission">Christian mission</a> sent by Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory the Great</a> in 596 to convert Britain's <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>. The mission was headed by <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a>. By the time of the death of the last missionary in 653, the mission had <a href="Christianisation%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">established Christianity</a> in southern Britain. Along with the Irish and <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> missions it converted other parts of Britain as well and influenced the <a href="Hiberno-Scottish%20mission">Hiberno-Scottish mission</a>s to Continental Europe.

By the time the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> recalled its <a href="Roman%20legion">legions</a> from the province of <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britannia</a> in 410, parts of the island had already been <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20invasion%20of%20Britain">settled</a> by <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">pagan</a> <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic tribes</a> who, later in the century, appear to have taken control of Kent and other coastal regions no longer defended by the Roman Empire. In the late 6th century Pope Gregory sent a group of missionaries to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a> to convert <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht</a>, King of Kent, whose wife, <a href="Bertha%20of%20Kent">Bertha of Kent</a>, was a Frankish princess and practising Christian. Augustine had been the <a href="prior">prior</a> of Gregory's own monastery in Rome and Gregory prepared the way for the mission by soliciting aid from the Frankish rulers along Augustine's route. In 597, the forty missionaries arrived in Kent and were permitted by <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht</a> to preach freely in his capital of <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>.

Soon the missionaries wrote to Gregory telling him of their success, and of the conversions taking place. The exact date of Æthelberht's conversion is unknown but it occurred before 601. A second group of monks and clergy was dispatched in 601 bearing books and other items for the new foundation. Gregory intended Augustine to be the <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitan</a> archbishop of the southern part of the British Isles, and gave him power over the clergy of the native Britons, but in a series of meetings with Augustine the long-established Celtic bishops refused to acknowledge his authority.

Before Æthelberht's death in 616, a number of other bishoprics had been established. However, after that date, a pagan backlash set in and the <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a>, or bishopric, of London was abandoned. Æthelberht's daughter, <a href="%C3%86thelburg%20of%20Kent">Æthelburg</a>, married <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin</a>, the king of the <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>ns, and by 627 <a href="Paulinus%20of%20York">Paulinus</a>, the bishop who accompanied her north, had converted Edwin and a number of other Northumbrians. When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee back to Kent. Although the missionaries could not remain in all of the places they had evangelised, by the time the last of them died in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman tradition to the practice of Christianity in Britain.

By the 4th century the Roman province of Britannia was converted to Christianity and had even produced its own heretic in <a href="Pelagius">Pelagius</a>. Britain sent three bishops to the <a href="Synod%20of%20Arles%20%28314%29">Synod of Arles</a> in 314, and a <a href="Gauls">Gaulish</a> bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters. Lead baptismal basins and other artefacts bearing Christian symbols testify to a growing Christian presence at least until about 360.

After the Roman legions withdrew from Britannia in 410 the natives of Great Britain were left to defend themselves, and non-Christian <a href="Angles">Angles</a>, <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>, and <a href="Jutes">Jutes</a>—generally referred to collectively as Anglo-Saxons—settled the southern parts of the island. Though most of Britain remained Christian, isolation from Rome bred a number of distinct practices—<a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Celtic Christianity</a>—including emphasis on monasteries instead of bishoprics, differences in calculation of the date of <a href="Easter">Easter</a>, and a modified clerical <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a>. Evidence for the continued existence of Christianity in eastern Britain at this time includes the survival of the cult of <a href="Saint%20Alban">Saint Alban</a> and the occurrence of "eccles"—from the Latin for "church"—in place names. There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxon newcomers.

The Anglo-Saxon invasions coincided with the disappearance of most remnants of Roman civilisation in the areas held by the Anglo-Saxons, including the economic and religious structures. Whether this was a result of the Angles themselves, as the early medieval writer <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a> argued, or mere coincidence is unclear. The archaeological evidence suggests much variation in the way that the tribes established themselves in Britain concurrently with the decline of urban Roman culture in Britain. The net effect was that when Augustine arrived in 597 the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms had little continuity with the preceding Roman civilisation. In the words of the historian John Blair, "Augustine of Canterbury began his mission with an almost clean slate."

Most of the information available on the Gregorian mission comes from the medieval writer <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, especially his "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>", or "Ecclesiastical History of the English People". For this work Bede solicited help and information from many people including his contemporary abbot at Canterbury as well as a future <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Nothhelm">Nothhelm</a>, who forwarded Bede copies of papal letters and documents from Rome. Other sources are biographies of Pope Gregory, including one written in Northern England around 700 as well as a 9th-century life by a Roman writer. The early "Life of Gregory" is generally believed to have been based on oral traditions brought to northern England from either Canterbury or Rome, and was completed at <a href="Whitby%20Abbey">Whitby Abbey</a> between 704 and 714. This view has been challenged by the historian Alan Thacker, who argues that the "Life" derives from earlier written works; Thacker suggests that much of the information it contains comes from a work written in Rome shortly after Gregory's death. Gregory's entry in the "<a href="Liber%20Pontificalis">Liber Pontificalis</a>" is short and of little use, but he himself was a writer whose work sheds light on the mission. In addition, over 850 of Gregory's letters survive. A few later writings, such as letters from Boniface, an 8th-century Anglo-Saxon missionary, and royal letters to the papacy from the late 8th century, add additional detail. Some of these letters, however, are only preserved in Bede's work.

Bede represented the native <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">British</a> church as wicked and sinful. In order to explain why Britain was conquered by the Anglo-Saxons, he drew on the polemic of Gildas and developed it further in his own works. Although he found some native British clergy worthy of praise he nevertheless condemned them for their failure to convert the invaders and for their resistance to Roman ecclesiastical authority. This bias may have resulted in his understating British missionary activity. Bede was from the north of England, and this may have led to a bias towards events near his own lands. Bede was writing over a hundred years after the events he was recording with little contemporary information on the actual conversion efforts. Nor did Bede completely divorce his account of the missionaries from his own early 8th-century concerns.

Although a few <a href="Hagiography">hagiographies</a>, or saints' biographies, about native British saints survive from the period of the mission, none describes native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons. Most of the information about the British church at this time is concerned with the western regions of the island of Great Britain and does not deal with the Gregorian missionaries. Other sources of information include Bede's chronologies, the set of laws issued by Æthelberht in Kent, and the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", which was compiled in the late 9th century.

In 595, when Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission to the Anglo-Saxons, the Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht. He had married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588, and perhaps earlier than 560. Bertha was the daughter of <a href="Charibert%20I">Charibert I</a>, one of the <a href="Merovingian%20dynasty">Merovingian</a> kings of the <a href="Franks">Franks</a>. As one of the conditions of her marriage she had brought a bishop named <a href="Liudhard">Liudhard</a> with her to Kent as her chaplain. They restored a church in Canterbury that dated to Roman times, possibly the present-day <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Church%2C%20Canterbury">St Martin's Church</a>. Æthelberht was at that time a pagan but he allowed his wife freedom of worship. Liudhard does not appear to have made many converts among the Anglo-Saxons, and if not for the discovery of a gold coin, the <a href="Liudhard%20medalet">Liudhard medalet</a>, bearing the inscription "Leudardus Eps" ("Eps" is an abbreviation of "Episcopus", the Latin word for bishop) his existence may have been doubted. One of Bertha's biographers states that, influenced by his wife, Æthelberht requested Pope Gregory to send missionaries. The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.

Most historians take the view that Gregory initiated the mission, although exactly why remains unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the British Church, relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Anglo-Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. Supposedly Gregory inquired about the identity of the slaves, and was told that they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels. The earliest version of this story is from an anonymous "Life of Gregory" written at Whitby Abbey about 705. Bede, as well as the Whitby "Life of Gregory", records that Gregory himself had attempted to go on a missionary journey to Britain before becoming pope. In 595 Gregory wrote to one of the papal estate managers in southern Gaul, asking that he buy English slave boys in order that they might be educated in monasteries. Some historians have seen this as a sign that Gregory was already planning the mission to Britain at that time, and that he intended to send the slaves as missionaries, although the letter is also open to other interpretations.

The historian N. J. Higham speculates that Gregory had originally intended to send the British slave boys as missionaries, until in 596 he received news that Liudhard had died, thus opening the way for more serious missionary activity. Higham argues that it was the lack of any bishop in Britain which allowed Gregory to send Augustine, with orders to be consecrated as a bishop if needed. Another consideration was that cooperation would be more easily obtained from the Frankish royal courts if they no longer had their own bishop and agent in place.

Higham theorises that Gregory believed that the end of the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the <a href="apocalypse">apocalypse</a>. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through <a href="Six%20ages%20of%20the%20world">six ages</a>, and that he was living at the end of the sixth age, a notion that may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for the conversion of non-Christians within their territories. He urged the conversion of the heretical <a href="Arianism">Arians</a> in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the conversion of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.

Some scholars suggest that Gregory's main motivation was to increase the number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a>. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian <a href="Eric%20John">Eric John</a> argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.

The choice of Kent and Æthelberht was almost certainly dictated by a number of factors, including that Æthelberht had allowed his Christian wife to worship freely. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established,and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Another reason for the mission was the growing power of the Kentish kingdom. Since the eclipse of King <a href="Ceawlin%20of%20Wessex">Ceawlin of Wessex</a> in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having <a href="imperium">imperium</a>, or overlordship, south of the <a href="Humber">River Humber</a>. Lastly, the proximity of Kent to the Franks allowed for support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish Church and not merely as a spiritual adviser to the queen. Archaeological remains support the notion that there were cultural influences from <a href="Francia">Francia</a> in England at that time.

In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, prior of Gregory's own <a href="San%20Gregorio%20Magno%20al%20Celio">monastery of St Andrew</a> in Rome, to head the mission to Kent. Gregory selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish kings. The pope wrote to a number of Frankish bishops on Augustine's behalf, introducing the mission and asking that Augustine and his companions be made welcome. Copies of letters to some of these bishops survive in Rome. The pope wrote to King <a href="Theuderic%20II">Theuderic II</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundy</a> and to King <a href="Theudebert%20II">Theudebert II</a> of <a href="Austrasia">Austrasia</a>, as well as their grandmother <a href="Brunhilda%20of%20Austrasia">Brunhilda of Austrasia</a>, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King <a href="Chlothar%20II">Chlothar II</a> of <a href="Neustria">Neustria</a> for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and were asked to allow some Frankish priests to accompany the mission. By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to ensure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which enjoyed the evident support of his wife's relatives and people. The Franks at that time were attempting to extend their influence in Kent, and assisting Augustine's mission furthered that goal. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.

The mission consisted of about forty missionaries, some of whom were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by the nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return, which Gregory refused, and instead sending Augustine back with letters to encourage the missionaries to persevere. Another reason for the pause may have been the receipt of news of the death of King <a href="Childebert%20II">Childebert II</a>, who had been expected to help the missionaries; Augustine may have returned to Rome to secure new instructions and letters of introduction, as well as to update Gregory on the new political situation in Gaul. Most likely, they halted in the <a href="Rhone">Rhone</a> valley. Gregory also took the opportunity to name Augustine as abbot of the mission. Augustine then returned to the rest of the missionaries, with new instructions, probably including orders to seek consecration as a bishop on the Continent if the conditions in Kent warranted it.

In 597 the mission landed in Kent, and it quickly achieved some initial success: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury, where they used the church of St. Martin's for services, and this church became the seat of the bishopric. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597.

In the early medieval period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and large numbers of converts are recorded within a year of the mission's arrival in Kent. By 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler <a href="Thomas%20Elmham">Thomas Elmham</a>, gives the date of the king's conversion as <a href="Pentecost">Whit Sunday</a>, or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, but there is no other evidence for it. A letter of Gregory's to Patriarch <a href="Eulogius%20of%20Alexandria">Eulogius of Alexandria</a> in June 598 mentions the number of converts made, but does not mention any baptism of the king in 597, although it is clear that by 601 he had been converted. The royal baptism probably took place at Canterbury but Bede does not mention the location.

Why Æthelberht chose to convert to Christianity is uncertain. Bede suggests that the king converted strictly for religious reasons, but most modern historians see other motives behind Æthelberht's decision. Certainly, given Kent's close contacts with Gaul, it is possible that Æthelberht sought baptism in order to smooth his relations with the Merovingian kingdoms, or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul. Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion, whether directly from the newly introduced church or indirectly from other Christian kingdoms.

Evidence from Bede suggests that, although Æthelberht encouraged conversion, he could not compel his subjects to become Christians. The historian R. A. Markus feels that this was due to a strong pagan presence in the kingdom that forced the king to rely on indirect means including royal patronage and friendship to secure conversions. For Markus this is demonstrated by the way in which Bede describes the king's conversion efforts which, when a subject converted, were to "rejoice at their conversion" and to "hold believers in greater affection".

After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success along with questions about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum", this section of the "History" is usually known as the "<a href="Libellus%20responsionum">Libellus responsionum</a>". Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on some issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass. Other than the trip by Laurence, little is known of the activities of the missionaries in the period from their arrival until 601. Gregory mentions the mass conversions, and there is mention of Augustine working miracles that helped win converts, but there is little evidence of specific events.

According to Bede, further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a <a href="pallium">pallium</a> for Augustine, gifts of sacred vessels, <a href="vestment">vestment</a>s, <a href="relic">relic</a>s, and books. The pallium was the symbol of <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitan</a> status, and signified that Augustine was in union with the <a href="Holy%20See">Roman papacy</a>. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain twelve <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>s as soon as possible, and to send a bishop to <a href="York">York</a>. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitan sees, one at York and one at London, with twelve suffragan bishops under each archbishop. Augustine was also instructed to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury, which never happened, perhaps because London was not part of Æthelberht's domain. Also, London remained a stronghold of paganism, as events after the death of Æthelberht revealed. London at that time was part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Essex">Kingdom of Essex</a>, which was ruled by Æthelberht's nephew <a href="S%C3%A6bert%20of%20Essex">Sæbert of Essex</a>, who converted to Christianity in 604. The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after Æthelberht's death that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see, contradicting Bede's version of events. The choice of London as Gregory's proposed southern archbishopric was probably due to his understanding of how Britain was administered under the Romans, when London was the principal city of the province.

Along with the letter to Augustine, the returning missionaries brought a letter to Æthelberht that urged the king to act like the Roman Emperor <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a> and force the conversion of his followers to Christianity. The king was also urged to destroy all pagan shrines. However, Gregory also wrote a letter to <a href="Mellitus">Mellitus</a>, the "<a href="Epistola%20ad%20Mellitum">Epistola ad Mellitum</a>" of July 601, in which the pope took a different tack in regards to pagan shrines, suggesting that they be cleansed of idols and converted to Christian use rather than destroyed; the pope compared the Anglo-Saxons to the ancient <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a>, a recurring theme in Gregory's writings. He also suggested that the Anglo-Saxons build small huts much like those built during the <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish festival of <a href="Sukkot">Sukkot</a>, to be used during the annual autumn slaughter festivals so as to gradually change the Anglo-Saxon pagan festivals into Christian ones.

The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the reason for the conflicting advice is that the letter to Æthelberht was written first, and sent off with the returning missionaries. Markus argues that the pope, after thinking further about the circumstances of the mission in Britain, then sent a follow-up letter, the "Epistolae ad Mellitum", to Mellitus, then "en route" to Canterbury, which contained new instructions. Markus sees this as a turning point in missionary history, in that forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view that the "Epistola" represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht has been challenged by George Demacopoulos who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the king in spiritual matters, while the "Epistola" was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other. Flora Spiegel, a writer on <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20literature">Anglo-Saxon literature</a>, suggests that the theme of comparing the Anglo-Saxons to the Israelites was part of a conversion strategy involving gradual steps, including an explicitly proto-Jewish one between paganism and Christianity. Spiegel sees this as an extension of Gregory's view of Judaism as halfway between Christianity and paganism. Thus, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must be brought up to the equivalent of Jewish practices, then after that stage was reached they could be brought completely up to Christian practices.

Bede relates that after the mission's arrival in Kent and conversion of the king, they were allowed to restore and rebuild old Roman churches for their use. One such was Christ Church, Canterbury, which became Augustine's cathedral church. Archaeological evidence for other Roman churches having been rebuilt is slight, but the church of St Pancras in Canterbury has a Roman building at its core, although it is unclear whether that older building was a church during the Roman era. Another possible site is Lullingstone, in Kent, where a religious site dating to 300 was found underneath an abandoned church.

Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the <a href="monastery">monastery</a> of Saints <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a> and <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a>, which later became <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a>, on land donated by the king. This foundation has often been claimed as the first <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it Augustine introduced the <a href="Rule%20of%20St.%20Benedict">Rule of St. Benedict</a> into England, but there is no evidence that the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.

Gregory had ordered that the native British bishops were to be governed by Augustine and, consequently, Augustine arranged a meeting with some of the native clergy some time between 602 and 604. The meeting took place at a tree later given the name "Augustine's Oak", probably around the present-day boundary between <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> and <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>. Augustine apparently argued that the British church should give up any of its customs not in accordance with Roman practices, including the <a href="Easter%20controversy">dating of Easter</a>. He also urged them to help with the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons.

After some discussion, the local bishops stated that they needed to consult with their own people before agreeing to Augustine's requests, and left the meeting. Bede relates that a group of native bishops consulted an old hermit who said they should obey Augustine if, when they next met with him, Augustine rose when he greeted the natives. But if Augustine failed to stand up when they arrived for the second meeting, they should not submit. When Augustine failed to rise to greet the second delegation of British bishops at the next meeting, Bede says the native bishops refused to submit to Augustine. Bede then has Augustine proclaim a prophecy that because of lack of missionary effort towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British church, the native church would suffer at the hands of the Anglo-Saxons. This prophecy was seen as fulfilled when Æthelfrith of Northumbria supposedly killed 1200 native monks at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chester">Battle of Chester</a>. Bede uses the story of Augustine's two meetings with two groups of British bishops as an example of how the native clergy refused to cooperate with the Gregorian mission. Later, <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a>, the <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">abbot of Malmesbury</a>, writing in the later part of the 7th century, claimed that the native clerks would not eat with the missionaries, nor would they perform Christian ceremonies with them. <a href="Laurence%20of%20Canterbury">Laurence</a>, Augustine's successor, writing to the Irish bishops during his tenure of Canterbury, also stated that an Irish bishop, <a href="Dagan%20%28bishop%29">Dagan</a>, would not share meals with the missionaries.

One probable reason for the British clergy's refusal to cooperate with the Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands at the time of the mission. The British were unwilling to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.

Most of the information on the Gregorian mission comes from Bede's narrative, and this reliance on one source necessarily leaves the picture of native missionary efforts skewed. First, Bede's information is mainly from the north and the east of Britain. The western areas, where the native clergy was strongest, was an area little covered by Bede's informants. In addition, although Bede presents the native church as one entity, in reality the native British were divided into a number of small political units, which makes Bede's generalisations suspect. The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the "Libellus" points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity. Besides the text of the "Libellus" contained within Bede's work, other versions of the letter circulated, some of which included a question omitted from Bede's version. Wood argues that the question, which dealt with the cult of a native Christian saint, is only understandable if this cult impacted Augustine's mission, which would imply that Augustine had more relations with the local Christians than those related by Bede.

In 604, another bishopric was founded, this time at <a href="Diocese%20of%20Rochester">Rochester</a>, where <a href="Justus">Justus</a> was consecrated as bishop. The king of Essex was converted in the same year, allowing another see to be established at <a href="Diocese%20of%20London">London</a>, with Mellitus as bishop. <a href="R%C3%A6dwald%20of%20East%20Anglia">Rædwald</a>, the king of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20East%20Angles">East Angles</a>, also was converted, but no see was established in his territory. Rædwald had been converted while visiting Æthelberht in Kent, but when he returned to his own court he worshiped pagan gods as well as the Christian god. Bede relates that Rædwald's backsliding was because of his still-pagan wife, but the historian S. D. Church sees political implications of overlordship behind the vacillation about conversion. When Augustine died in 604, Laurence, another missionary, succeeded him as archbishop.

The historian N. J. Higham suggests that a <a href="synod">synod</a>, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London during the early years of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. <a href="Saint%20Boniface">Boniface</a>, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20III">Gregory III</a> in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. <a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a>, another historian, is not so sure that there was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.

The rise of <a href="%C3%86thelfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelfrith of Northumbria</a> in the north of Britain limited Æthelbertht's ability to expand his kingdom as well as limiting the spread of Christianity. Æthelfrith took over <a href="Deira">Deira</a> about 604, adding it to his own realm of <a href="Bernicia">Bernicia</a>. However, the Frankish kings in Gaul were increasingly involved in internal power struggles, leaving Æthelbertht free to continue to promote Christianity within his own lands. The Kentish Church sent Justus, then Bishop of Rochester, and Peter, the abbot of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey in Canterbury, to the <a href="Edict%20of%20Paris">Council of Paris</a> in 614, probably with Æthelbertht's support. Æthelbertht also promulgated a code of laws, which was probably influenced by the missionaries.

A pagan reaction set in following Æthelbert's death in 616; Mellitus was expelled from London never to return, and Justus was expelled from Rochester, although he eventually managed to return after spending some time with Mellitus in Gaul. Bede relates a story that Laurence was preparing to join Mellitus and Justus in Francia when he had a dream in which <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a> appeared and whipped Laurence as a rebuke for his plans to leave his mission. When Laurence woke whip marks had miraculously appeared on his body. He showed these to the new Kentish king, who promptly was converted and recalled the exiled bishops.

The historian N. J. Higham sees political factors at work in the expulsion of Mellitus, as it was Sæberht's sons who banished Mellitus. Bede said that the sons had never been converted, and after Æthelberht's death they attempted to force Mellitus to give them the Eucharist without ever becoming Christians, seeing the Eucharist as magical. Although Bede does not give details of any political factors surrounding the event, it is likely that by expelling Mellitus the sons were demonstrating their independence from Kent, and repudiating the overlordship that Æthelberht had exercised over the East Saxons. There is no evidence that Christians among the East Saxons were mistreated or oppressed after Mellitus' departure.

Æthelberht was succeeded in Kent by his son <a href="Eadbald%20of%20Kent">Eadbald</a>. Bede states that after Æthelberht's death Eadbald refused to be baptised and married his stepmother, an act forbidden by the teachings of the Roman Church. Although Bede's account makes Laurence's miraculous flogging the trigger for Eadbald's baptism, this completely ignores the political and diplomatic problems facing Eadbald. There are also chronological problems with Bede's narrative, as surviving papal letters contradict Bede's account. Historians differ on the exact date of Eadbald's conversion. D. P. Kirby argues that papal letters imply that Eadbald was converted during the time that Justus was Archbishop of Canterbury, which was after Laurence's death, and long after the death of Æthelberht. <a href="Henry%20Mayr-Harting">Henry Mayr-Harting</a> accepts the Bedan chronology as correct, and feels that Eadbald was baptised soon after his father's death. Higham agrees with Kirby that Eadbald did not convert immediately, contending that the king supported Christianity but did not convert for at least eight years after his father's death.

The spread of Christianity in the north of Britain gained ground when <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin of Northumbria</a> married Æthelburg, a daughter of Æthelbert, and agreed to allow her to continue to worship as a Christian. He also agreed to allow Paulinus of York to accompany her as a bishop, and for Paulinus to preach to the court. By 627, Paulinus had converted Edwin, and on Easter, 627, Edwin was baptised. Many others were baptised after the king's conversion. The exact date when Paulinus went north is unclear; some historians argue for 625, the traditional date, whereas others believe that it was closer to 619. Higham argues that the marriage alliance was part of an attempt by Eadbald, brother of the bride, to capitalise on the death of Rædwald in about 624, in an attempt to regain the overkingship his father had once enjoyed. According to Higham, Rædwald's death also removed one of the political factors keeping Eadbald from converting, and Higham dates Eadbald's baptism to the time that his sister was sent to Northumbria. Although Bede's account gives all the initiative to Edwin, it is likely that Eadbald also was active in seeking such an alliance. Edwin's position in the north also was helped by Rædwald's death, and Edwin seems to have held some authority over other kingdoms until his death.

Paulinus was active not only in Deira, which was Edwin's powerbase, but also in Bernicia and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lindsey">Lindsey</a>. Edwin planned to set up a northern archbishopric at York, following Gregory the Great's plan for two archdioceses in Britain. Both Edwin and Eadbald sent to Rome to request a pallium for Paulinus, which was sent in July 634. Many of the East Angles, whose king, <a href="Eorpwald%20of%20East%20Anglia">Eorpwald</a> appears to have converted to Christianity, were also converted by the missionaries. Following Edwin's death in battle, in either 633 or 634, Paulinus returned to Kent with Edwin's widow and daughter. Only one member of Paulinus' group stayed behind, <a href="James%20the%20Deacon">James the Deacon</a>. After Justus' departure from Northumbria, a new king, <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a>, invited missionaries from the Irish monastery of <a href="Iona">Iona</a>, who worked to convert the kingdom.

About the time that Edwin died in 633, a member of the East Anglian royal family, <a href="Sigeberht%20of%20East%20Anglia">Sigeberht</a>, returned to Britain after his conversion while in exile in Francia. He asked <a href="Honorius%20of%20Canterbury">Honorius</a>, one of the Gregorian missionaries who was then Archbishop of Canterbury, to send him a bishop, and Honorius sent <a href="Felix%20of%20Burgundy">Felix of Burgundy</a>, who was already a consecrated bishop; Felix succeeded in converting the East Angles.

The Gregorian missionaries focused their efforts in areas where Roman settlement had been concentrated. It is possible that Gregory, when he sent the missionaries, was attempting to restore a form of Roman civilisation to England, modelling the church's organisation after that of the church in Francia at that time. Another aspect of the mission was how little of it was based on monasticism. One monastery was established at Canterbury, which later became St Augustine's Abbey, but although Augustine and some of his missionaries had been monks, they do not appear to have lived as monks at Canterbury. Instead, they lived more as <a href="secular%20clergy">secular clergy</a> serving a <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a> church, and it appears likely that the sees established at Rochester and London were organised along similar lines. The Gaulish and Italian churches were organised around cities and the territories controlled by those cities. Pastoral services were centralised, and churches were built in the larger villages of the cities' territorial rule. The seat of the bishopric was established in the city and all churches belonged to the diocese, staffed by the bishop's clergy.

Most modern historians have noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as colourless and boring, compared to the Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of "<a href="gravitas">gravitas</a>", or personal dignity not given to emotional displays, and this would have limited the colourful stories available about them.

One reason for the mission's success was that it worked by example. Also important was Gregory's flexibility and willingness to allow the missionaries to adjust their liturgies and behaviour. Another reason was the willingness of Æthelberht to be baptised by a non-Frank. The king would have been wary of allowing the Frankish bishop Liudhard to convert him, as that might open Kent up to Frankish claims of overlordship. But being converted by an agent of the distant Roman pontiff was not only safer, it allowed the added prestige of accepting baptism from the central source of the Latin Church. As the Roman Church was considered part of the Roman Empire in Constantinople, this also would gain Æthelberht acknowledgement from the emperor. Other historians have attributed the success of the mission to the substantial resources Gregory invested in its success; he sent over forty missionaries in the first group, with more joining them later, a quite significant number.

The last of Gregory's missionaries, Archbishop Honorius, died on 30 September 653. He was succeeded as archbishop by <a href="Deusdedit%20of%20Canterbury">Deusdedit</a>, a native Englishman.

The missionaries were forced to proceed slowly, and could not do much about eliminating pagan practices, or destroying temples or other sacred sites, unlike the missionary efforts that had taken place in Gaul under <a href="Martin%20of%20Tours">St Martin</a>. There was little fighting or bloodshed during the mission. Paganism was still practised in Kent until the 630s, and it was not declared illegal until 640. Although Honorius sent Felix to the East Angles, it appears that most of the impetus for conversion came from the East Anglian king.

With the Gregorian missionaries, a third strand of Christian practice was added to the British Isles, to combine with the Gaulish and the Hiberno-British strands already present. Although it is often suggested that the Gregorian missionaries introduced the <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a> into England, there is no supporting evidence. The early archbishops at Canterbury claimed supremacy over all the bishops in the British Isles, but their claim was not acknowledged by most of the rest of the bishops. The Gregorian missionaries appear to have played no part in the conversion of the <a href="Wessex">West Saxon</a>s, who were converted by a missionary sent directly by Pope <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20I">Honorius I</a>. Neither did they have much lasting influence in Northumbria, where after Edwin's death the conversion of the Northumbrians was achieved by missionaries from Iona, not Canterbury.

An important by-product of the Gregorian mission was the close relationship it fostered between the Anglo-Saxon Church and the Roman Church. Although Gregory had intended for the southern archiepiscopal see to be located at London, that never happened. A later tradition, dating from 797, when an attempt was made to move the archbishopric from Canterbury to London by King <a href="Coenwulf%20of%20Mercia">Coenwulf of Mercia</a>, stated that on the death of Augustine, the "wise men" of the Anglo-Saxons met and decided that the see should remain at Canterbury, for that was where Augustine had preached. The idea that an archbishop needed a pallium in order to exercise his archiepiscopal authority derives from the Gregorian mission, which established the custom at Canterbury from where it was spread to the Continent by later Anglo-Saxon missionaries such as <a href="Willibrord">Willibrord</a> and Boniface. The close ties between the Anglo-Saxon church and Rome were strengthened later in the 7th century when <a href="Theodore%20of%20Tarsus">Theodore of Tarsus</a> was appointed to Canterbury by the papacy.

The mission was part of a movement by Gregory to turn away from the East, and look to the Western parts of the old Roman Empire. After Gregory, a number of his successors as pope continued in the same vein, and maintained papal support for the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. The missionary efforts of Augustine and his companions, along with those of the <a href="Hiberno-Scottish%20mission">Hiberno-Scottish mission</a>aries, were the model for the later <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20mission">Anglo-Saxon mission</a>aries to Germany. The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the Gregorian mission was a turning point in papal missionary strategy, marking the beginnings of a policy of persuasion rather than coercion.

Another effect of the mission was the promotion of the cult of Pope Gregory the Great by the Northumbrians amongst others; the first "Life" of Gregory is from Whitby Abbey in Northumbria. Gregory was not popular in Rome, and it was not until Bede's "Ecclesiastical History" began to circulate that Gregory's cult also took root there. Gregory, in Bede's work, is the driving force behind the Gregorian mission, and Augustine and the other missionaries are portrayed as depending on him for advice and help in their endeavours. Bede also gives a leading role in the conversion of Northumbria to Gregorian missionaries, especially in his "Chronica Maiora", in which no mention is made of any Irish missionaries. By putting Gregory at the centre of the mission, even though he did not take part in it, Bede helped to spread the cult of Gregory, who not only became one of the major saints in Anglo-Saxon England, but continued to overshadow Augustine even in the afterlife; an Anglo-Saxon church council of 747 ordered that Augustine should always be mentioned in the liturgy right after Gregory.

A number of the missionaries were considered saints, including Augustine, who became another cult figure; the monastery he founded in Canterbury was eventually rededicated to him. Honorius, Justus, Lawrence, Mellitus, Paulinus, and Peter, were also considered saints, along with Æthelberht, of whom Bede said that he continued to protect his people even after death.

A few objects at Canterbury have traditionally been linked with the mission, including the 6th-century <a href="St%20Augustine%20Gospels">St Augustine Gospels</a> produced in Italy, now held at Cambridge as Corpus Christi College MS 286. There is a record of an illuminated and imported "Bible of St Gregory", now lost, at Canterbury in the 7th century. Thomas of Elmham, in the late 15th century, described a number of other books held at that time by St Augustine's Abbey, believed to have been gifts to the abbey from Augustine. In particular, Thomas recorded a <a href="psalter">psalter</a> as being associated with Augustine, which the antiquary <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a> saw at the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in the 1530s, but it has since disappeared.

Augustine built a church at his foundation of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey at Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's Abbey. This church was destroyed after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> to make way for a new abbey church. The mission also established Augustine's cathedral at Canterbury, which became Christ Church Priory. This church has not survived, and it is unclear if the church that was destroyed in 1067 and described by the medieval writer <a href="Eadmer">Eadmer</a> as Augustine's church, was built by Augustine. Another medieval chronicler, <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">Florence of Worcester</a>, claimed that the priory was destroyed in 1011, and Eadmer himself had contradictory stories about the events of 1011, in one place claiming that the church was destroyed by fire and in another claiming only that it was looted. A cathedral was also established in Rochester; although the building was destroyed in 676, the bishopric continued in existence. Other church buildings were erected by the missionaries in London, York, and possibly Lincoln, although none of them survive.

The missionaries introduced a musical form of <a href="chant">chant</a> into Britain, similar to that used in Rome during the <a href="mass">mass</a>. During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's chanting, and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, who became <a href="Bishop%20of%20York">Bishop of York</a>. <a href="Putta%20%28bishop%20of%20Hereford%29">Putta</a>, the first <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>, had a reputation for his skill at chanting, which he was said to have learned from the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught chanting in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted that James was accomplished in the singing of the chants.

The historian <a href="Ann%20Williams%20%28historian%29">Ann Williams</a> has argued that the missionaries' familiarity with the Roman law, recently codified by the Emperor <a href="Justinian">Justinian</a> in the "<a href="Corpus%20Iuris%20Civilis">Corpus Iuris Civilis</a>" promulgated in 534, were an influence on the English kings promulgating their own law codes. Bede specifically calls Æthelberht's code a "code of law after the Roman manner". Another influence, also introduced by the missionaries, on the early English law codes was the Old Testament legal codes. Williams sees the issuing of legal codes as not just laws but also as statements of royal authority, showing that the kings were not just warlords but also lawgivers and capable of securing peace and justice in their kingdoms. It has also been suggested that the missionaries contributed to the development of the <a href="charter">charter</a> in England, for the earliest surviving charters show not just Celtic and Frankish influences but also Roman touches. Williams argues that it is possible that Augustine introduced the charter into Kent.

Indian Camp

"Indian Camp" is a short story written by <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>. The story was first published in 1924 in <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>'s literary magazine "<a href="transatlantic%20review">Transatlantic Review</a>" in Paris and republished by <a href="Boni%20%26amp%3B%20Liveright">Boni & Liveright</a> in Hemingway's first American volume of short stories "<a href="In%20Our%20Time%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">In Our Time</a>" in 1925. Hemingway's semi-autobiographical character <a href="Nick%20Adams%20%28character%29">Nick Adams</a>—a child in this story—makes his first appearance in "Indian Camp", told from his point of view.

In the story Nick Adams' father, a country doctor, has been summoned to a <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> or "Indian" camp to deliver a pregnant woman of her baby. At the camp, the father is forced to perform an emergency <a href="caesarean%20section">caesarean section</a> using a jack-knife, with Nick as his assistant. Afterward, the woman's husband is discovered dead, having slit his throat during the operation. The story shows the emergence of Hemingway's <a href="Iceberg%20Theory">understated style</a> and his use of counterpoint. An initiation story, "Indian Camp" includes themes such as childbirth and fear of death which permeate much of Hemingway's subsequent work. When the story was published, the quality of writing was noted and praised, and scholars consider "Indian Camp" an important story in the Hemingway <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>.

The story begins in the pre-dawn hours as the young <a href="Nick%20Adams%20%28character%29">Nick Adams</a>, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby for a woman who has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a <a href="Caesarian%20section">caesarian</a> operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the <a href="Breech%20birth">breech</a> position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor from ear to ear during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.

In the early 1920s, Hemingway and his wife <a href="Hadley%20Richardson">Hadley</a> lived in Paris where he was foreign correspondent for the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>". When Hadley became pregnant they returned to Toronto. Hemingway biographer Kenneth Lynn suggests that Hadley's childbirth became the inspiration for the story. She went into labor while Hemingway was on a train, returning from New York. Lynn believes Hemingway likely was terrified Hadley would not survive the birth, and he became "beside himself with fear ... about the extent of her suffering and swamped by a sense of helplessness at the realization that he would probably arrive too late to be of assistance to her". Hemingway wrote "Indian Camp" a few months after <a href="Jack%20Hemingway">John Hemingway</a> was born in Toronto on October 10, 1923.

While they were in Toronto, Hemingway's first book, "Three Stories and Ten Poems", was published in Paris, followed months later by a second volume, "in our time" (without capitals), which included 18 short <a href="Vignette%20%28literature%29">vignettes</a> presented as untitled chapters. Hemingway, Hadley, and their son (nicknamed Bumby) returned to Paris in January 1924, moving into a new apartment on the Rue Notre Dame des Champs. With <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, Hemingway helped <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a> edit his newly launched literary magazine, "<a href="transatlantic%20review">Transatlantic Review</a>", which published pieces by <a href="modernism">modernists</a> such as Pound, <a href="John%20Dos%20Passos">John Dos Passos</a>, <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a>, as well as Hemingway.

"Indian Camp" began as a 29-page untitled manuscript that Hemingway cut to seven pages; at first he called the story "One Night Last Summer". In 1924, the seven-page story titled "Indian Camp" was published by the "Transatlantic Review" in the "Works in Progress" section, along with a piece from James Joyce's manuscript "<a href="Finnegans%20Wake">Finnegans Wake</a>". A year later on October 5, 1925, "Indian Camp" was republished by <a href="Boni%20%26amp%3B%20Liveright">Boni & Liveright</a> in New York, in an expanded American edition of Hemingway's first collection of short stories titled "<a href="In%20Our%20Time%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">In Our Time</a>", (with capitals) with a print-run of 1335 copies.

"Indian Camp" was later included in Hemingway's collection "<a href="The%20Fifth%20Column%20and%20the%20First%20Forty-Nine%20Stories">The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories</a>" published in October 1938. Two collections of short stories published after Hemingway's death included "Indian Camp": "<a href="The%20Nick%20Adams%20Stories%20%28book%29">The Nick Adams Stories</a>" (1972) and "<a href="The%20Complete%20Short%20Stories%20of%20Ernest%20Hemingway">The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vigía Edition</a>" (1987). "The Nick Adams Stories" (1972), edited by Philip Young, included the story fragment titled "Three Shots" that Hemingway originally cut from "Indian Camp".

"Indian Camp" is an initiation story. Nick's father (Dr. Adams) exposes his young son to childbirth and, unintentionally, to violent death—an experience that causes Nick to equate childbirth with death. Hemingway critic Wendolyn Tetlow maintains that in "Indian Camp", sexuality culminates in "butchery-style" birth and bloody death, and that Nick's anxiety is obvious when he turns away from the butchery. The story reaches a climax when Nick's "heightened awareness" of evil causes him to turn away from the experience. Although Nick may not want to watch the caesarian, his father insists he watch - he does not want his son to be initiated into an adult world without toughness, writes Thomas Strychacz.

Hemingway biographer Philip Young writes that Hemingway's emphasis in "Indian Camp" was not primarily on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself, but on young Nick Adams, who witnesses these events and becomes a "badly scarred and nervous young man". In "Indian Camp", Hemingway begins the events that shape the Adams persona. Young considers this single Hemingway story to hold the "master key" to "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Critic Howard Hannum agrees. He believes the trauma of birth and suicide Hemingway paints in "Indian Camp" rendered a <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a> that gave Hemingway a unified framework for the Nick Adams stories.

"Indian Camp" is also about the fear of death. The section cut from the story highlights Nick's fear; the published version underscores it in a less obvious manner. In the cut section, later published as "Three Shots", the night before being taken to the Indian camp Nick is left alone in the forest, where he is "overwhelmed by thoughts of death". Critic Paul Strong speculates that Hemingway may have intended the narrative to be structured so that Nick's father chose to take his fearful son to the Indian camp where Nick faced the grisly reality of death, which can have done "little to assuage Nick's fears." Hannum believes Hemingway is intentionally vague about the details of the birth but not the death; he speculates that Nick would have likely "blocked out much of the caesarian but he had clearly seen the father's head tilted back".

Critics have questioned why the woman's husband kills himself. Strong finds the arguments that the husband is driven to suicide by the wife's screaming to be problematic because the suicide occurs at the moment the screams are silenced. He points to Hemingway's statement in "<a href="Death%20in%20the%20Afternoon">Death in the Afternoon</a>", "if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it", as evidence that the husband may have killed himself because he is "driven frantic by his wife's pain, and perhaps his own".

The story also shows the innocence of childhood; Nick Adams believes he will live forever and be a child forever; he is a character who sees his life "stretching ahead." At the end of the story, in the boat with his father, Nick denies death when he says he will never die. "Indian Camp" shows Hemingway's early fascination with suicide and with the conflict between fathers and sons. Young thinks there is an unavoidable focus on the fact that the two people the principal characters are based on—the father, Clarence Hemingway, and the boy, Ernest Hemingway—end up committing suicide. Kenneth Lynn writes that the irony to modern readers is that both characters in "that boat on the lake would one day do away with themselves". Hemingway shot himself on July 2, 1961; his father had shot himself on December 6, 1928.

In his essay "Hemingway's Primitivism and 'Indian camp

According to Hemingway scholar Thomas Strychacz, in the story Hemingway presents a re-enactment of the arrival of Europeans in the New World and the subsequent doctrine of <a href="manifest%20destiny">manifest destiny</a>. The white men in the story arrive on the water and are met at a beach by natives. The native husband and father of the baby loses everything, causing him to kill himself: his home is overtaken, and his wife ripped apart. The white doctor tells his son to ignore the woman's screams: "her screams are not important. I don't hear them because they are not important." The doctor's victory is to control nature by delivering a baby, diminished by the father's suicide who through his death symbolically takes back control from the white doctor.

Meyers claims the story is not autobiographical though it is an early example of Hemingway's ability to tell stories "true to life." In the story, Nick Adams' father, who is portrayed as "professionally cool", is based on Hemingway's own father, Clarence Hemingway. Hemingway's paternal uncle, George, appears in the story, and is treated unsympathetically. Hannum suggests George may have been the child's father, writing that in the story remains the "never-resolved implication of the paternity of the Indian child". During the surgery the mother bites Uncle George, the Indians laugh at him, and he leaves when the father is found dead.

Jackson Benson writes in "Ernest Hemingway: The Life as Fiction and the Fiction as Life" that critics should refrain from finding connections between Hemingway's life and fiction and instead focus on how he uses biographical events to transform life into art. He believes the events in a writer's life have only a vague relationship to the fiction, like a dream from which a drama emerges. Of Hemingway's earliest stories, Benson claims "his early fiction, his best, has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare". In his essay "On Writing", Hemingway wrote that "Indian Camp" was a story in which imaginary events were made to seem real: "Everything good he'd ever written he'd made up . ... Of course he'd never seen an Indian woman having a baby. That was what made it good."

Hemingway biographer <a href="Carlos%20Baker">Carlos Baker</a> writes that Hemingway learned from his short stories how to "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style has become known as the <a href="iceberg%20theory">iceberg theory</a>, because, as Baker describes it, in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as <a href="framing%20device">framing device</a>s to write about life in general—not only his life. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface.

Hemingway learned from <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> how to achieve a stripped-down style and how to incorporate the concepts of <a href="imagism">imagism</a> in his prose. He said Pound "had taught him more 'about how to write and how not to write' than any son of a bitch alive"; and his friend James Joyce told him "to pare down his work to the essentials". The prose is spare and lacks a clear <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">symbolism</a>. Instead of more conventional literary <a href="allusion">allusion</a>s, Hemingway relied on repetitive <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>s or <a href="metonymy">metonymy</a> to build images. The caesarian is repeatedly associated with words such as "the blanket" and "the bunk" in a series of <a href="objective%20correlative">objective correlative</a>s, a technique Hemingway learned from <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a>. Tetlow believes in this early story Hemingway ignored character development; he simply places a character in a setting, and adds descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound, which give a sense of truth.

"Indian Camp" is constructed in three parts: the first places Nick and his father on a dark lake; the second takes place in the squalid and cramped cabin amid terrifying action; and the third shows Nick and his father back on the lake—bathed in sunlight. Hemingway's use of counterpoint is evident when, for example, at the end, Nick trails his hand in lake water that "felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning". Paul Strong believes the deleted section may have provided context and additional counterpoint to the plot, with Nick's aloneness in the "stillness of the night" juxtaposed against the middle scene, crowded with people. Paul Smith writes that by cutting the piece, Hemingway focuses on the story's central point: the life and death initiation rituals, familiar to the residents of the Indian camp but alien to young Nick. Unable to express his feelings fully, in the end, Nick trails his hand in the water and "felt quite sure that he would never die".

Hemingway's writing style attracted attention when "in our time" (without capitals) was published in Paris in 1924—in a small-print run from Ezra Pound's modernist series through <a href="Three%20Mountains%20Press">Three Mountains Press</a>. <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a> described the writing as "of the first distinction", enough to bring attention to Hemingway. When "Indian Camp" was published, it received considerable praise. <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a> regarded "Indian Camp" as an important early story by a young writer. Critics in the United States claimed Hemingway reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style. Hemingway said "In Our Time" had "pretty good unity" and generally critics agree.

In the 1970s <a href="Carlos%20Baker">Carlos Baker</a> wrote of the stories from "In Our Time", and specifically "Indian Camp", that they were a remarkable achievement. Hemingway scholars, such as Benson, rank "Indian Camp" as one of Hemingway's "greatest short stories," a story that is described as "best known", "violent" and "dramatic". In 1992, Frederick Busch wrote in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that Hemingway had gone out of fashion. While his antisemitism, racism, violence, and attitudes toward women and homosexuals made him objectionable by current standards, he turned violence into art unlike any other American writer of his time by showing that "the making of art is a matter of life or death, no less". Busch believes Hemingway's characters either faced life or chose death, a choice shown most starkly in "Indian Camp". The saving of a life in "Indian Camp" is at the center of much of Hemingway's fiction, Busch writes, and adds power to his fiction.

R U Professional

"R U Professional" is a 2009 satirical song by the American <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="The%20Mae%20Shi">The Mae Shi</a>, inspired by a July 2008 outburst by actor <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a> on the set of "<a href="Terminator%20Salvation">Terminator Salvation</a>". Bale was filming with actress <a href="Bryce%20Dallas%20Howard">Bryce Dallas Howard</a> when he berated <a href="Cinematographer">director of photography</a>, <a href="Shane%20Hurlbut">Shane Hurlbut</a>, for walking into his line of sight. An audio recording of the incident appeared on website <a href="TMZ">TMZ</a> on February 2, 2009. The Mae Shi composed and recorded the song later in the same day, and released it the next day. The group stated that the piece was created to honor Bale. The song <a href="Parody%20music">parodies</a> Bale by <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sampling</a> his voice from the 2008 diatribe. The chorus incorporates Bale's use of the word "professional" from his flare-up. The lyrics reference several films the actor starred in, including "<a href="Newsies">Newsies</a>", "<a href="Swing%20Kids%20%281993%20film%29">Swing Kids</a>", "<a href="American%20Psycho%20%28film%29">American Psycho</a>", and "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>".

The song was made available on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and via download on <a href="MediaFire">MediaFire</a> the next day. "R U Professional" received a generally positive reception, and was praised as an effective parody of Bale's on-set disturbance. <a href="MTV">MTV</a> compared its style to <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave</a> groups like <a href="Devo">Devo</a>. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" described it as a lively <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a> tribute to the actor. "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" categorized the song as fun <a href="dance%20music">dance music</a> and called it creatively motivated. "<a href="The%20Toronto%20Sun">The Toronto Sun</a>" wrote positively of its creative lyrics and use of audio from the Bale oration. "<a href="El%20Pa%C3%ADs">El País</a>" classed the piece as an electropop song that contributed to the <a href="Viral%20video">viral spread</a> of the Bale rant online. "<a href="Dose%20%28magazine%29">Dose</a>" placed the song within the genre of an <a href="Electro%20%28music%29">electro</a> <a href="jam%20session">jam session</a>. Publications including "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" and <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> were impressed with the group's ability to compose and release the song twenty-four hours after the audio of the incident appeared online. The "<a href="Irish%20Independent">Irish Independent</a>" wrote that they thought the group may have used a <a href="melody">melody</a> they already had and adapted it for the song to release it so quickly.

In July 2008, actor <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a> was immersed in shooting a scene for the film "<a href="Terminator%20Salvation">Terminator Salvation</a>" in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>. While performing with actress <a href="Bryce%20Dallas%20Howard">Bryce Dallas Howard</a>, Bale shouted at the film's <a href="Cinematographer">director of photography</a>, <a href="Shane%20Hurlbut">Shane Hurlbut</a>, for walking into his line of sight. Hurlbut responded calmly, apologized to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.

An audio recording of the incident appeared on the website <a href="TMZ">TMZ</a> on February 2, 2009. During the four-minute audio recording, Bale can be heard shouting and swearing at Hurlbut and threatening to quit the film if Hurlbut did it again and was not fired. Prior to releasing the audio on the internet, TMZ had reported on the incident on their website in July 2008. TMZ reported that film executives for "Terminator Salvation" had sent a copy of the audio recording to the film's insurance company in case Bale quit the film.

In a statement to Los Angeles radio station <a href="KROQ-FM">KROQ-FM</a> on February 6, 2009, Bale said he had behaved inappropriately, and that he and Hurlbut had talked after the incident and fully resolved the issue. Bale acknowledged that the two worked together for several hours after the incident, and for a month afterwards as well. He noted that he had viewed a draft version of the film and praised the <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a> work done by Hurlbut.

The Mae Shi explained the group's inspiration to write the song in a statement. The group felt Bale's outburst was irrational and was motivated to write a piece about it. The Mae Shi emphasized in their statement that this was not a traditional song associated with their group's normal work, but rather a homage to Bale.

The Mae Shi drummer Brad Breeck commented in an interview that the band decided to make a song about the incident late in the evening of February 2, 2009. Breeck noted that they listened to the audio of the Bale diatribe and put together their tribute piece within a span of two hours before putting it online. Jacob Cooper, another drummer in the band, commented to "<a href="The%20Arizona%20Daily%20Star">The Arizona Daily Star</a>" that he was surprised how popular their piece became when they had devoted relatively little time to composing and recording it.

The lyrics of the song include references to films Bale appeared in including "<a href="Newsies">Newsies</a>", "<a href="Swing%20Kids%20%281993%20film%29">Swing Kids</a>", "<a href="American%20Psycho%20%28film%29">American Psycho</a>", and "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>". The song begins with the phrase, "He is the Dark Knight, he is professional." The piece incorporates audio clips from the incident through the use of <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sampling</a>. The chorus of the song references Bale's use of the word "professional" in his altercation: "Oh, whoo wow / He is professional / But I think he's lost control". Lyrics include: "Swing Kid with a violent streak", "Step back, stay out of his light / Better not try to put up a fight / Newsies will get you tonight / 'Cause they're professional!", and "Don't look too deep in his eyes/he can't hide what's inside of his mind/and it might get a little bit ugly/and you might meet an American Psycho".

"R U Professional" was made available on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a href="MediaFire">MediaFire</a> on February 3, 2009. The video description on YouTube by the group stated, "Song By The Mae Shi celebrating the life and work of Xtian Bale. Bale's performance as John Connor in the upcoming Terminator 4 'Redemption' Film will no doubt be one of the greatest of all time. He will win every Oscar for his performance, even the special effects and animation ones." "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" reported that the band would appear at a music festival, "The Fans Strike Back", and requested they perform "R U Professional".

Several media outlets attempted to place the work within a particular <a href="genre">genre</a>. <a href="MTV">MTV</a> compared the song's style to the group <a href="Devo">Devo</a> and <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave music</a>. "<a href="El%20Pa%C3%ADs">El País</a>" described the piece as an <a href="electropop">electropop</a> song that contributed to the <a href="Viral%20video">viral spread</a> of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. "<a href="Dose%20%28magazine%29">Dose</a>" described it as an <a href="electro%20%28music%29">electro</a> <a href="jam%20session">jam session</a> which made adept use of sampling from the audio of Bale's rhetoric. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" called the piece a lively <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a> tribute to the actor. "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" called the song fun dance music and creatively motivated. "<a href="The%20Toronto%20Sun">The Toronto Sun</a>" praised its original lyrics and use of audio from the incident, and described the piece as a fusion of electro-pop styles and a good song for dancing. "<a href="New%20Musical%20Express">New Musical Express</a>" recommended the piece, and described it as electro-rock which astutely sampled Bale throughout the song. The "<a href="St.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>" described the piece as a form of new wave music which used the most spasmodic segments of the incident, and commented that the end product was comedic. "The Arizona Daily Star" described the piece as a pop music dance song.

Multiple sources remarked upon the speed with which The Mae Shi were able to put the song together and release it. "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" highlighted the song among <a href="Internet%20meme">Internet meme</a>s inspired by the Bale melee, and wrote that though the piece was put together quickly it was quite entertaining and inventive. The "<a href="Irish%20Independent">Irish Independent</a>" was surprised at the speed multiple different satirical adaptations of the Bale commotion audio including "R U Professional" were put together. The newspaper questioned whether the song was composed in one day, and speculated that the melody might have been written by the group previously and modified to use with audio from the Bale incident. "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>" was impressed that "R U Professional" was made in twenty-four hours.

Various websites commented that the song was a unique way to pay tribute to Christian Bale and his body of work. "<a href="Boing%20Boing">Boing Boing</a>" called the song an amusing homage to Bale. "C7nema" commented that the song was hilarious and dedicated to Bale's odd behavior. "The Celebrity Cafe" wrote that the piece was better than "<a href="Bale%20Out">Bale Out</a>" by <a href="Lucian%20Piane">RevoLucian</a> which also dealt with the incident. "<a href="Chicagoist">Chicagoist</a>" wrote that the song by The Mae Shi was their favorite of the Christian Bale remixes. "<a href="Chico%20News%20%26amp%3B%20Review">Chico News & Review</a>" called the piece a caring accolade to Bale's on-set tirade.

<doc id="21436165" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21436165" title="Fertilisation of Orchids">
Fertilisation of Orchids

Fertilisation of Orchids is a book by English naturalist <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> published on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title "On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects, and On the Good Effects of Intercrossing". Darwin's previous book, "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>", had briefly mentioned <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.

The book was his first detailed demonstration of the power of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>, and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the <a href="coevolution">coevolution</a> of <a href="Orchidaceae">orchid</a>s and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced <a href="botany">botanist</a>s, and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in <a href="pollination">pollinating</a> flowers. It opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology, directly related to Darwin's ideas on evolution, and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by <a href="Allogamy">cross-fertilisation</a>. Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. "Orchids" was the first in a series of books on his innovative investigations into plants.

The book describes how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a> attributed to a <a href="Deism">grand designer</a>. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a <a href="Creator%20deity">Creator</a>. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of "<a href="Catasetum">Catasetum</a>", which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long <a href="nectar">nectar</a>y of "<a href="Angraecum%20sesquipedale">Angraecum sesquipedale</a>" meant that there must be a moth with an equally long <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a>. This was confirmed in 1903 when "<a href="Xanthopan%20morganii">Xanthopan morganii praedicta</a>" was found in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>.

<a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> grew up with an interest in <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a>, and as a student at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> he became a pupil and close friend of <a href="botany">botany</a> professor <a href="John%20Stevens%20Henslow">John Stevens Henslow</a>. The year he graduated, Darwin was given a <a href="wikt%3Asupernumerary">supernumerary</a> position as a gentleman naturalist and geologist on the <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">second voyage of HMS "Beagle"</a>, a trip that lasted five years. By the time he returned in October 1836, he had doubts about the doctrine that <a href="species">species</a> were fixed and unchanging. Within months, experts informed him that specimens he had collected were separate species, not just <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a>, and the patterns he saw inspired the <a href="inception%20of%20Darwin%27s%20theory">inception of his theory</a> of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> in 1838. Darwin began editing and publishing the expert reports, collected in the "<a href="Zoology%20of%20the%20Voyage%20of%20H.M.S.%20Beagle">Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle</a>", at the same time as writing a series of books on geology, the first of which was "<a href="The%20Structure%20and%20Distribution%20of%20Coral%20Reefs">The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs</a>". His "species work" was his "prime hobby", a background to this writing, but it evolved into an extensive research programme during the twenty years before he <a href="publication%20of%20Darwin%27s%20theory">published his theory</a>.

Darwin's speculations on the origin of species convinced him that <a href="Allogamy">cross-fertilisation</a> played an important role in keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a> that <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural <a href="Heterosis">outbreeding</a> through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an <a href="Fitness%20%28biology%29">evolutionary advantage</a> by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of <a href="Entomophily">insect pollination</a> to the <a href="allogamy">cross-pollination</a> of flowers.
In the summer of 1841 Charles and <a href="Emma%20Darwin">Emma Darwin</a> moved from the turmoil of London to the countryside, to <a href="Down%20House">Down House</a>, a quiet former <a href="parson">parson</a>age in the village of <a href="Downe">Downe</a>. He wrote, "The flowers are here very beautiful". Darwin followed the recommendation of his friend, the leading botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a>, and read "<a href="Das%20entdeckte%20Geheimnis%20der%20Natur%20im%20Bau%20und%20in%20der%20Befruchtung%20der%20Blumen">Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen</a>" ("The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilisation of Flowers Discovered"). The little known book, published in 1793 by <a href="Christian%20Konrad%20Sprengel">Christian Konrad Sprengel</a> but never translated into English, introduced the idea that flowers were created by God to fulfill a <a href="teleology">teleological purpose</a>: insects would act as "living brushes" to cross-fertilise plants in a <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationship. This functional view was rejected and mostly forgotten, as it contradicted the common belief that flowers had been created for beauty, and were generally self-fertilising. For Darwin, the concept of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> gave new meaning to Sprengel's research into the mechanisms for cross-fertilisation. He welcomed its support for his supposition that cross-fertilisation in flowering plants tended to allow their offspring to avoid possible disadvantages resulting from self-fertilisation, and by 1845 he had verified many of Sprengel's observations.

A favourite walk took the Darwin family to a spot above the quiet <a href="Cudham">Cudham</a> valley, teeming with orchids including "<a href="Cephalanthera">Cephalanthera</a>", "<a href="Neottia%20nidus-avis">Neottia</a>", <a href="fly%20orchid">fly orchid</a>s and <a href="musk%20orchid">musk orchid</a>s. They called this place "Orchis Bank", and the whole family became involved in Darwin's researches. Darwin observed orchids every summer, but in twenty years, only on two occasions (when he noticed butterflies "sucking <a href="Pyramidal%20orchid">"O. pyramidalis"</a> and "<a href="Gymnadenia">Gymnadenia</a>"") did he see insects visiting flowers.
In 1854, Darwin began to work full-time on the origin of species. He examined orchids and counted how often one or both <a href="Pollinium">pollinia</a> (pollen masses) had been removed from their flowers, indicating that they had been visited by insects. He experimented with insect pollination to investigate whether, by cross-fertilising field crops such as <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a>, they would yield more vigorous offspring, and published letters about his inconclusive results in "The Gardeners' Chronicle" in 1857 and 1858. He next applied Sprengel's methods to <a href="empirical%20research">empirical research</a> on orchids. Despite delays caused by <a href="Charles%20Darwin%27s%20illness">recurring illness</a>, he made progress on writing his planned "Big Book" on evolution, but when <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a>'s letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> in 1858, Darwin quickly wrote "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" as an abstract of his theory, published on 22 November 1859. In this book, he gave credence to Sprengel's ideas on the advantages of "intercrossing", and noted: "Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them". He introduced his new concept, the process of <a href="coevolution">coevolution</a>, describing the co-adaptation of <a href="bumblebee">bumblebee</a>s and <a href="Trifolium%20pratense">red clover</a>, and speculating "how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure". This was a theme he developed in his orchid book.

After "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" was published, Darwin became involved in producing revised editions as well as working on "<a href="Variation%20of%20Animals%20and%20Plants%20Under%20Domestication">Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication</a>" as the first part of his planned "Big Book". By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at <a href="Hartfield">Hartfield</a>, he was searching for orchids when he noticed a <a href="Drosera">sundew</a>. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of <a href="Carnivorous%20plant">insectivorous plants</a>. He investigated other <a href="botany">botanical</a> questions raised by his ideas of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>, including the advantages of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in <a href="primula">primula</a>s, and the <a href="Adaptation">adaptive mechanisms</a> that ensure cross-pollination in orchids. As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting his wits against nature, and following <a href="Serendipity">lucky hunches</a>. His theory was a way of looking at the world, enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, "I am like a gambler, & love a wild experiment."

Around the end of April 1860, Darwin discussed insect pollination with his friend <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Dalton Hooker</a>, and mentioned the <a href="Ophrys%20apifera">bee orchid</a>. Darwin corresponded with Hooker's assistant <a href="Daniel%20Oliver">Daniel Oliver</a>, the senior curator at <a href="Kew%20Gardens">Kew Gardens</a>, who became a follower of Darwin's ideas. At the start of June, Darwin wrote to "<a href="The%20Gardeners%27%20Chronicle">The Gardeners' Chronicle</a>" asking for readers' observations on how <a href="Ophrys">bee or fly orchids</a> were fertilised. His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from "<a href="Anacamptis%20morio">Orchis morio</a>" and "<a href="Orchis%20mascula">Orchis mascula</a>" plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass <a href="bell%20jar">bell jar</a>. He wrote to American botanist <a href="Asa%20Gray">Asa Gray</a> that he had been "so struck with admiration at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle", and made similar enquiries of other experts.

Darwin became engrossed in meticulous microscopic examination, tracing the complicated mechanisms of flowers that attracted insects by their nectar so that the insects transported pollen to cross-pollinate other plants, and on 19 July he told Hooker, "I am intensely interested on subject, just as at a game of chess." In September, he "dissected with the greatest interest" and wrote, "The contrivances for insect fertilisation in Orchids are multiform & truly wonderful & beautiful." By October, he had "a large mass of notes with many new facts", but set them aside "convinced that I ought to work on "Variation" & not amuse myself with interludes".

During 1861, botany became a preoccupation for Darwin, and his projects became serious scientific pursuits. He continued his study of orchids throughout the summer, writing to anyone who might be able to supply specimens he had not yet examined. Field naturalists, botanists, and country <a href="gentry">gentry</a> sent specimens from across the British Isles. Darwin also tramped around the countryside with tin cans and biscuit boxes, collecting specimens which his gardeners potted up for him. His family joined in, and neighbours contributed to the research. As he had only a cold <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a>, a friend on the other side of the village who had a hot-house allowed him to use that, and offered the services of his gardener to look after the delicate specimens. Darwin's aim was to show how the complex structures and life cycles of the plants could be explained by natural selection rather than by the handiwork of God; he saw the huge variety of flowers as a collection of "ad hoc" evolutionary adaptations. In June he described his examination of <a href="Ophrys%20apifera">bee orchids</a> as a passion, and his findings on insect fertilisation of orchids as "beautiful facts".

There were several replies to Darwin's enquiry in "<a href="The%20Gardeners%27%20Chronicle">The Gardeners' Chronicle</a>" seeking evidence to support his idea that pollen masses attached themselves to a convenient place on an insect's back or head, usually its <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a>, to transport the pollen to another flower. One envelope appeared to be empty when it arrived at Down House, but when he looked further before discarding it he found several insect mouthparts with pollen masses attached. To help their daughter <a href="Etty%20Darwin">Henrietta</a> convalesce from illness, the Darwins arranged to spend two months in <a href="Torquay">Torquay</a>. Darwin wrote:
He sought advice on obtaining the exotic South American "<a href="Catasetum">Catasetum</a>", to see it eject pollen masses, as "I am got intensely interested on subject & think I understand pretty well all the British species." They went to Torquay on 1 July, and Darwin began writing his orchid paper. By 10 August, he feared his paper would run "to 100 M.S. folio pages!!! The beauty of the adaptations of parts seems to me unparalleled ... I marvel often as I think over the diversity & perfection of the contrivances."
The family returned to Downe on 27 August, and Darwin again wrote to the "Gardeners' Chronicle" appealing for assistance as he was "very anxious to examine a few exotic forms". His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration of plants and animals had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a> was strongly influenced by German <a href="idealism">idealism</a> and in 1856 had asked if it was "to be supposed for a moment that the beauty of colour and outline ... are any "good" to the animals? ... Who has ever dreamed of finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers ... ?" Darwin had, and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case. His ideas would transform the way naturalists thought about coloration.

The completed "Orchis" paper came to 140 folio pages, and Darwin decided against presenting it at the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a>, thinking of publishing a pamphlet instead. He offered the draft to <a href="John%20Murray%20%28publisher%29">John Murray</a> who agreed to publish it as a book. Although Darwin feared a lack of public interest, he hoped it would serve to "illustrate how Natural History may be worked under the belief of the modification of Species". In discussions with Asa Gray about <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>, he wrote that "it really seems to me incredibly monstrous to look at an orchid as created as we now see it. Every part reveals modification on modification."

As a popular and acceptable activity, botany had been taken up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence. On the recommendation of <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a>, Darwin wrote to <a href="Lady%20Dorothy%20Nevill">Lady Dorothy Nevill</a>, who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested a signed photograph of him to hang in her sitting room next to portraits of her other notable friends, including Hooker.

The orchid book was delayed because of illness, but Darwin continued to "look at it as a hobby-horse, which has given me great pleasure to ride". He was particularly astounded by the long <a href="Spur%20%28biology%29">spur</a> of the "<a href="Angraecum%20sesquipedale">Angraecum sesquipedale</a>" flowers, one of the orchids sent by the distinguished horticulturist <a href="James%20Bateman">James Bateman</a>, and wrote to Hooker "Good Heavens what insect can suck it[?]"

By November, a specimen of the exotic South American "<a href="Catasetum">Catasetum</a>" orchid Hooker had given to Darwin had shown its "truly marvellous" mechanism, by which it shot out a <a href="pollinium">pollinium</a> at any insect touching a part of the flower "with sticky gland always foremost". This plant had astonished botanists in 1836 when <a href="Robert%20Hermann%20Schomburgk">Robert Hermann Schomburgk</a> stated that he had seen one plant growing three distinct flowers which usually grew separately and had wrongly been categorised as three distinct <a href="genus">genera</a>, namely "Catasetum tridentatum", "Monachanthus viridis", and "Myanthus barbatus". <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> had remarked that "such cases shake to the foundation all our ideas of the stability of genera and species." One of Darwin's correspondents told of delight at growing a beautiful specimen of "Myanthus barbatus" imported from <a href="Demerara">Demerara</a>, then dismay when the plant flowered the next year as a simple "Catasetum".

In view of this interest, Darwin prepared a paper on "Catasetum" as an extract from his forthcoming book, which was read to the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a> on 3 April 1862. Darwin solved the puzzle by showing that the three flowers were the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of a single species, but as they differed so much from each other, they had been classified as different genera.

Darwin sent the incomplete manuscript to his publisher <a href="John%20Murray%20%28publisher%29">John Murray</a> on 9 February 1862, while he was still working on the last chapter. Although anxious that the book might not sell, he could "say with confidence that the M.S. contains many new & very curious facts & conclusions". When the book was printed, he sent out presentation copies to all the individuals and societies who had helped him with his investigations, and to eminent botanists in Britain and abroad for review.

On 15 May 1862 the book was published under the full title of "On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects, and On the Good Effects of Intercrossing". In August, Darwin was "well contented with the sale of 768 copies; I shd. hope & expect that the remainder will ultimately be sold", but the book sold slowly and less than 2,000 copies of the first edition were printed. An expanded edition translated into French was published in Paris in 1870, and in 1877 Murray brought out a revised and expanded second edition, with the shortened title "The Various Contrivances by Which Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects". This was also published by <a href="D.%20Appleton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">D. Appleton & Company</a> of New York in 1877, and a German translation was published in the same year. Despite being well praised by botanists, only about 6,000 copies of the English editions had been sold by 1900.

Darwin set out a detailed study of <a href="common%20descent">common descent with modifications</a> by expanding on the theme of <a href="coevolution">coevolution</a> between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>". He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a> of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> to demonstrate how slight variations in <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">similar structures</a> of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.

In the introduction, Darwin explained his aim of meeting complaints that detailed support for his theory was lacking in "On the Origin of Species". He chose orchids for his subject as "amongst the most singular and most modified forms in the vegetable kingdom" in the hope of inspiring work on other species, and felt that "the study of organic beings may be as interesting to an observer who is fully convinced that the structure of each is due to secondary laws, as to one who views every trifling detail of structure as the result of the direct interposition of the Creator." He gave due credit to previous authors who had described the agency of insects in fertilising orchids, and all who had helped him.

In the first chapter Darwin described the British orchids he had studied, giving detailed explanations of their various mechanisms for transferring pollen to insects. The first mechanism described is that of "<a href="Orchis%20mascula">Orchis mascula</a>", which serves as an introduction to the explanation of other <a href="Orchidaceae">Orchidaceae</a>. In the upper part of the flower a petal shelters the <a href="Stamen">male organ</a> which has two packages of pollen grains, held together by thin elastic threads. These <a href="Pollinium">pollen masses</a> stand side by side and have stalks down to adhesive balls in a cup which keeps them moist and sticky. When an insect lands on the large projecting lower petal, the <a href="Labellum%20%28botany%29">labellum</a>, and pushes its head and <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> into the centre of the flower and down to the <a href="nectar">nectar</a>y, it breaks the cup and the adhesive balls attach the pollen masses to the front of the insect. As the insect flies off, each stalk rotates the pollen mass downwards and forwards so that when the insect lands on another flower the pollen masses attached to the insect pass under the male organ and leave pollen on the <a href="Gynoecium">female organ</a>, achieving cross fertilisation. Darwin envisaged:
This is followed by descriptions of the differences in the mechanisms of several other orchids. In "<a href="Pyramidal%20orchid">Orchis pyramidalis</a>", the adhesive balls are combined together into a strap or saddle shape, which curls round the thin <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> of a moth or butterfly to attach to it the pair of pollen masses, illustrated in the book by showing a moth's head with seven pairs of pollen masses attached to its proboscis.

While the <a href="Ophrys%20apifera">bee orchid</a> showed <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a> for self-fertilisation, its mechanism also enabled occasional cross-fertilisation, creating the <a href="biodiversity">biological diversity</a> that Darwin felt was needed for vigorous survival, which could not be provided by self-fertilisation. As an example of "how beautifully everything is contrived", Darwin described how he had found that in "<a href="Spiranthes">Spiranthes</a>" flowers the pollen is ready for collection before access is open for the female organ to receive pollen. At <a href="Torquay">Torquay</a> he had watched bees visiting spires of these flowers, starting at the bottom of the spire and working their way up to the topmost flowers. He speculated that if bees moved from top to top of the spires, the pollen clusters they collected from the most recently opened flowers would be wasted as the topmost flowers on the next spike would not be ready to receive pollen. A bee starting at the lowest flowers on the first spire it visited would continue up until it reached flowers that still had their pollen masses to attach to the bee, then would fly to the mature lower flowers on another plant, and fertilise them. By this co-ordinated process, the bee would add "to her store of honey" while perpetuating the flowers "which will yield honey to future generations of bees".

The book moves on to the various foreign orchids Darwin had received from others. His experiments showed that the "astonishing length" of the 11 inch (290 mm) long <a href="nectar">nectar</a>y hanging from "<a href="Angraecum%20sesquipedale">Angraecum sesquipedale</a>" flowers implied the need for an as yet unknown moth with a <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> 10–11 inches (250–275 mm) long to pollinate these flowers in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. He viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race, writing that "there has been a race in gaining length between the nectary of the Angræcum and the proboscis of certain moths". This wastefulness is familiar in modern terms as the idea of an <a href="evolutionary%20arms%20race">evolutionary arms race</a>, but was disturbing to biologists of the time who believed that adaptations were the outcome of benevolent <a href="teleological%20argument">divine purpose</a>.

Darwin described "the most remarkable of all Orchids", "<a href="Catasetum">Catasetum</a>", and showed how in these flowers, "as throughout nature, pre-existing structures and capacities [had been] utilised for new purposes". He explained the mechanism in which the pollen masses of the <a href="pollinium">pollinium</a> were connected by a bent stalk or <a href="Pedicel%20%28botany%29">pedicel</a> to a sticky disc kept moist at the back of the flower. When an insect touched an "antenna" projecting from the back of the flower, this released the bent pedicel which sprang straight and fired the pollinium, sticky disc first, at the insect. In experiments, Darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring. He vividly illustrated how the flower ejected the pollinium with considerable force: "I touched the antennæ of C. callosum whilst holding the flower at about a yard's distance from the window, and the pollinium hit the pane of glass, and adhered to the smooth vertical surface by its adhesive disc."

Darwin noted that the essential nectar, <a href="Secretion">secreted</a> to attract insects, seemed also in some cases to act as an <a href="excretion">excretion</a>: "It is in perfect accordance with the scheme of nature, as worked out by natural selection, that matter excreted to free the system from superfluous or injuring substances should be utilised for purposes of the highest importance." <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">Homologies</a> of the flowers of orchids showed them all to be based on "fifteen groups of vessels, arranged three within three, in alternating order". He disparaged the idea that this was an "ideal type" fixed by the Omnipotent Creator, but attributed it instead to its "descent from some <a href="monocotyledon">monocotyledon</a>ous plant, which, like so many other plants of the same division, possessed fifteen organs, arranged alternately three within three in five whorls; and that the now wonderfully changed structure of the flower is due to a long course of slow modification,—each modification having been preserved which was useful to each plant, during the incessant changes to which the organic and the inorganic world has been exposed".

Describing the final end state of the whole flower cycle as the production of seed, he set out a simple experiment in which he took a ripe seed capsule and arranged the seeds in a line, then counted the seeds in one-tenth of an inch (2.5 mm). By multiplication he found that each plant produced enough seeds to plant of ground, and the great grandchildren of a single plant could "carpet the entire surface of the land throughout the globe" if unchecked.

In conclusion, he felt that the book had "shown that Orchids exhibit an almost endless diversity of beautiful adaptations. When this or that part has been spoken of as contrived for some special purpose, it must not be supposed that it was originally always formed for this sole purpose. The regular course of events seems to be, that a part which originally served for one purpose, by slow changes becomes adapted for widely different purposes."
He was almost exasperated by the inventiveness of forms in nature; "In my examination of Orchids, hardly any fact has so much struck me as the endless diversity of structure,—the prodigality of resources,—for gaining the very same end, namely, the fertilisation of one flower by the pollen of another." His focus on detail was justified, as "The use of each trifling detail of structure is far from a barren search to those who believe in natural selection." The "contrivances and beautiful adaptations" slowly acquired through slight variations, subjected to natural selection "under the complex and ever-varying conditions of life", far transcended the most fertile imagination. The mechanisms to transport the pollen of one flower or of one plant to another flower or plant underlined the importance of cross-fertilisation: "For may we not further infer as probable, in accordance with the belief of the vast majority of the breeders of our domestic productions, that marriage between near relatives is likewise in some way injurious,—that some unknown great good is derived from the union of individuals which have been kept distinct for many generations?"

Botanists responded favourably to the book immediately on its publication. Hooker told Darwin that the book showed him to be "out of sight the best Physiological observer & experimenter that Botany ever saw", and was glad to note that two leading traditional botanists had accepted the concept of evolution; "Bentham & Oliver are quite struck up in a heap with your book & delighted beyond expression". <a href="Daniel%20Oliver">Daniel Oliver</a> thought it "very extraordinary", and even Darwin's old beetle-hunting rival <a href="Cardale%20Babington">Charles Babington</a>, by then professor of botany at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> and inclined to oppose natural selection, called it "exceedingly interesting and valuable ... highly satisfactory in all respects. The results are most curious and the skill shown in discovering them equally so." <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> praised its value in opening "a new field for observing the wonderful provisions of Nature ... a new and unexpected track to guide us in the explanation of phenomena which had before that appeared so irreconcilable with the ordinary prevision and method shown in the organised world."

The book's success in botanical circles was enhanced following Bentham's public endorsement. In his presidential address to the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society</a> on 24 May 1862, Bentham praised the book as exemplifying the biological method, and said that it had nearly overcome his opposition to the "Origin". In his address in 1863 he stated that "Mr Darwin has shown how changes "may" take place", and described it as "an unimpeachable example of a legitimate hypothesis" in compliance with <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>'s <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>. This endorsement favourably influenced <a href="Miles%20Joseph%20Berkeley">Miles Joseph Berkeley</a>, <a href="Charles%20Victor%20Naudin">Charles Victor Naudin</a>, <a href="Alphonse%20Pyramus%20de%20Candolle">Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle</a>, <a href="Jean%20Louis%20Armand%20de%20Quatrefages%20de%20Br%C3%A9au">Jean Louis Quatrefages</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Daubeny">Charles Daubeny</a>.

In June 1862, Darwin welcomed favourable reviews in the press and wrote to Hooker; "Well my orchis-book is a success (but I do not know whether it sells) after cursing my folly in writing it". He told his publisher, "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to <a href="Asa%20Gray">Asa Gray</a> he said, "I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists." Darwin's geologist friend <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a> gave it enthusiastic praise: "next to the "Origin", as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin <a href="William%20Darwin%20Fox">Fox</a>, "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it." The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.

Although the book contradicted the prevailing <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a> and its <a href="teleological%20argument">teleological</a> approach to design in nature, the "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">Saturday Review</a>" thought that it would avoid the angry polemics aroused by "On the Origin of Species". The "Literary Churchman" welcomed "Mr. Darwin's expression of admiration at the contrivances in orchids", only complaining that it was too indirect a way of saying "O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!" (<a href="Psalms">Psalm</a> <a href="Psalm%20104">104:24</a>) Darwin regarded these theological views as irritating misunderstandings, but wrote to <a href="Asa%20Gray">Asa Gray</a> describing his approach as a "flank movement on the enemy". By showing that the "wonderful contrivances" of the orchid have discoverable evolutionary histories, Darwin was countering claims by natural theologians that the organisms were examples of the perfect work of the Creator.

There was considerable controversy surrounding Darwin's prediction that a moth would be found in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> with a long proboscis matching the <a href="nectar">nectar</a>y of "<a href="Angraecum%20sesquipedale">Angraecum sesquipedale</a>". An anonymous article in the "<a href="Edinburgh%20Review">Edinburgh Review</a>" of October 1862 by <a href="George%20Campbell%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll</a>, argued that Darwin's wording implied purpose, and concluded that "We know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own, but the ideas and purposes of Another." He considered Darwin's explanations the "most unsatisfactory conjectures", and raised obscure metaphysical objections while supporting a kind of creative evolutionism. Emma Darwin thought that although Argyll was "quite opposed" to Darwin's views, "he praises the "Orchids" in such an enthusiastic way that he will do it a good turn". Darwin was delighted to find that a well written article "smashing" Argyll's review was by one of Darwin's own nephews.

Argyll went on in his 1867 book "The Reign of Law" to cleverly ridicule Darwin's ideas, particularly the prediction of a moth in Madagascar with a proboscis 10–11 inches (250–275 mm) long. He believed that adaptations showed divine purpose, not a mindless <a href="evolutionary%20arms%20race">evolutionary arms race</a>. In his response "Creation by Law" later that year, <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> produced a detailed explanation of how the nectary could have evolved through natural selection, and stated that he had carefully measured moths in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, finding that the proboscis of "<a href="Neococytius%20cluentius">Macrosila cluentius</a>" from South America was 9 inches (235 mm) long, and the proboscis of "Macrosila morganii" from tropical Africa (since renamed "<a href="Xanthopan%20morganii">Xanthopan morganii</a>") was 7 inches (190 mm) long. An enquiry raised in 1873 was answered by Darwin's friend <a href="Hermann%20M%C3%BCller%20%28botanist%29">Hermann Müller</a>, who stated that his brother <a href="Fritz%20M%C3%BCller">Fritz Müller</a> had caught a <a href="sphinx%20moth">sphinx moth</a> in Brazil with a proboscis nearly long. Darwin's anticipation was fully met in 1903, when a subspecies of "Xanthopan morganii" was found in Madagascar with a proboscis about 12 inches (300 mm) long, and was named "Xanthopan morganii praedicta" to celebrate this verification of a testable prediction made by Darwin on the basis of his theory of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>.

<a href="Michael%20Ghiselin">Michael Ghiselin</a> has expressed the view that all studies of <a href="coevolution">coevolution</a> follow directly or indirectly from Darwin's orchid book, which was also the origin of all work on the evolution of extreme specialisation. Its publication led almost immediately to research by many other naturalists into specialisation and coevolution, in some cases analysing other <a href="taxon">taxa</a>. In <a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Charles%20Darwin">his autobiography</a>, Darwin modestly recalled how this work had revived interest in <a href="Christian%20Konrad%20Sprengel">Christian Konrad Sprengel</a>'s neglected ideas:
Among the many prominent biologists who began research on coevolution, <a href="Hermann%20M%C3%BCller%20%28botanist%29">Hermann Müller</a> was particularly interested in the evolutionary sequence in which insects and flowers became adapted to each other. Like Darwin, he began with the premise that flowers were adapted to ensure cross-fertilisation, and added his own premise that most insects were not "limited by hereditary instinct to particular flowers". On this basis, he developed the view that specialisation develops from the need for flowers to attract pollinating insects (without making access too easy for non-pollinators), and from the evolution of pollinators to adapt to changes in the location of rewards such as nectar. He found that <a href="Alpine%20plant">alpine flowers</a> tended to be visited by bees at lower altitudes, and by butterflies at higher altitudes, beginning research on the idea that plants at different altitudes were specialised for different pollinators. By comparing related plant species that he thought had diverged in form from a common ancestor, and testing whether they were visited by butterflies or bees, he was the first to use a combination of <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> and ecological approaches to understand patterns in the evolution of interactions and specialisation. His brother <a href="Fritz%20M%C3%BCller">Fritz Müller</a> used similar methods when studying <a href="mimicry">mimicry</a> in Brazil. The early development of ideas on specialisation and coevolution became increasingly focused on the problem of mimicry; <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Walter Bates</a> had initially raised this issue in a paper read to the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a> in December 1861 in Darwin's presence, and published in November 1862.

Others basing their studies of reproductive ecology on Darwin's evolutionary approach included Friedrich Hildebrand and Severin Axell in Europe, <a href="Asa%20Gray">Asa Gray</a> and Charles Robertson in North America. In Italy, Federigo Delpino adopted the theory of descent but like Sprengel had a <a href="teleology">teleological</a> approach and explained the mechanisms of flowers by the intervention of a "psychovitalistic intelligence". Delpino classified flowers on the basis of the pollinators they attracted, and coined many of the terms still in use such as <a href="pollination%20syndrome">pollination syndrome</a> and <a href="ornithophily">ornithophily</a>. There was an enormous increase in knowledge during this period. In 1874, Asa Gray paid tribute to Darwin's work on orchids for explaining "all these and other extraordinary structures, as well as of the arrangement of blossoms in general, and even the very meaning and need of sexual propagation". He credited Darwin with establishing the understanding that "Nature abhors close fertilization".

By the end of the 19th century, there were so many uncritical and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers <a href="Frederic%20Clements">Frederic Clements</a>, <a href="Karl%20von%20Frisch">Karl von Frisch</a> and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> vision, and findings involving <a href="bee%20learning%20and%20communication">bee learning and communication</a>. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.

Darwin had "found the study of orchids eminently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the flower are coadapted for fertilisation by insects, & therefore the result of n. selection,—even most trifling details of structure". His own interest in orchids and in fertilisation of plants by insects continued. Darwin had been given the use of a hot-house at The Rookery on the other side of the village, and at the end of 1862 he was persuaded by this neighbour's helpful gardener to have his own built at Down House as an extension to the existing cold lean-to <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a>. The gardener drew up plans, and Darwin investigated stoves and ventilation devices. When it was completed in February 1863 he asked Hooker for some plants from <a href="Kew%20Gardens">Kew Gardens</a>, writing "I long to stock it, just like a school-boy", and sent his butler with a cart. When over 160 different plants were delivered, Darwin made apologetic remarks about depleting the national collection. He told Hooker "You cannot imagine what pleasure your plants give me ... Henrietta & I go & gloat over them." Darwin's life was changed by having a warm hothouse to spend time in before his walk round the Sandwalk, and in the 1870s he had several more hothouses built. The children later remembered this routine and the gardeners attending to Darwin's experimental plants, as well as the way that Darwin used simple equipment for his experiments, dissecting and measuring plants and seeds.

A chance observation "thoroughly aroused" Darwin's attention to a surprising decrease in vigour of the offspring of "<a href="Linaria%20vulgaris">Linaria vulgaris</a>" following only one instance of self-fertilisation, and after eleven years of experimental work he published "<a href="The%20Effects%20of%20Cross%20and%20Self%20Fertilisation%20in%20the%20Vegetable%20Kingdom">The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom</a>" in 1876 as "a complement to the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' because it shows how important are the results of cross-fertilisation which are ensured by the mechanisms described in that book." He told a friend "I cannot endure doing nothing", and resumed his work on orchids, assisted in his research by his son <a href="Francis%20Darwin">Francis Darwin</a>. He corresponded about orchids with <a href="Fritz%20M%C3%BCller">Fritz Müller</a>, and almost completely rewrote the book with a considerable amount of new material, much of which was contributed by Müller. The revised edition was published in 1877.

Francis Darwin described it as characteristic that his father delighted in the observations that preceded the publication of "Fertilisation of Orchids", not the applause which followed it. He quoted one of his father's last letters about orchids, written in 1880:
<a href="Kent%20Wildlife%20Trust">Kent Wildlife Trust</a> manages <a href="Downe%20Bank">Downe Bank</a>, which is near Down House and was a favourite place of the Darwin family, who called it 'Orchis Bank' because of the many wild orchids which grew there. It is now part of the 'Downe Bank and <a href="High%20Elms%20Country%20Park">High Elms</a>' <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>. Darwin's observations of local orchids and their insect pollinators gave him the evidence for co-evolution which provided the basis for the "Fertilisation of Orchids"." Experts have identified "Orchis Bank" as the species-rich setting encapsulated in the closing paragraph of "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>", in which Darwin wrote:

Darwin's home and its surroundings, including specifically "Orchis Bank", have been called his landscape laboratory, and together were nominated in January 2009 for designation as a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>. The bid was made by a partnership led by the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Bromley">London Borough of Bromley</a>, which now includes <a href="Downe">Downe</a>. It was included in the 39 proposed properties, but was not in the 21 new sites selected for the list.

The influence of Darwin's work was commemorated in the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s 15th Annual Orchid Show, "Orchids Through Darwin's Eyes", 24 January to 26 April 2009.

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is an <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> and <a href="soundtrack%20album">soundtrack album</a> for the 1982 blockbuster <a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">film of the same name</a> directed by <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>. Composed by <a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a>, the album was narrated by American recording artist <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, produced by composer <a href="Quincy%20Jones">Quincy Jones</a> and distributed by <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a>. The production of the audiobook had John Williams and Michael Jackson working with <a href="Rod%20Temperton">Rod Temperton</a>, <a href="Freddy%20DeMann">Freddy DeMann</a>, and <a href="Bruce%20Swedien">Bruce Swedien</a>.

The "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" audiobook was released by MCA on November 7, 1982—the same month as Michael Jackson's acclaimed sixth studio album "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>" despite conditions given by <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic Records</a>, Jackson's record label, that it should not be released until after "Thriller". As a result, Epic took legal action against MCA which forced the album's withdrawal. During its curtailed release, "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" reached number 82 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. It was well-received critically and won Jackson a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Album%20for%20Children">Best Recording for Children</a>.

The "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" album package contains a storybook, which allows listeners to read along with Jackson as he narrates the tale of E.T. and the alien's visit to planet Earth. The book contains a photograph of E.T. placing hands on Jackson's shoulders, while one of the extraterrestrial's fingers glows. This picture is included in the album package as a × full-color poster. The 20-page storybook include stills from the movie and the lyrics to the song "Someone in the Dark" (written by <a href="Alan%20Bergman">Alan</a> and <a href="Marilyn%20Bergman">Marilyn Bergman</a>), which Jackson sings on the audiobook. The recording, on a <a href="12-inch">12-inch</a> vinyl LP, features original music by <a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a>, integrated sound effects from the movie, as well as the voice of E.T. in the background.

Prior to the recording of the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" album, Jackson released four solo studio albums with <a href="Motown%20Records">Motown Records</a> between 1972 and 1975 ("<a href="Got%20to%20Be%20There">Got to Be There</a>", "<a href="Ben%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Ben</a>", "<a href="Music%20%26amp%3B%20Me">Music & Me</a>" and "<a href="Forever%2C%20Michael">Forever, Michael</a>"), and several with his brothers as part of <a href="The%20Jackson%205">The Jackson 5</a>. In 1975, he and his brothers (except <a href="Jermaine%20Jackson">Jermaine</a>) moved to <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic Records</a> and in 1979, Michael released his fifth solo album, "<a href="Off%20the%20Wall">Off the Wall</a>", to critical and commercial success.</small>

In June 1982, the <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>–directed <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> film "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a>" was released to cinemas. Created by Spielberg's <a href="Amblin%20Entertainment">Amblin Entertainment</a> and distributed by <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a> (then a subsidiary of <a href="MCA%20Inc.">MCA Inc.</a>), it starred <a href="Henry%20Thomas">Henry Thomas</a>, <a href="Dee%20Wallace">Dee Wallace</a>, <a href="Robert%20MacNaughton">Robert MacNaughton</a>, <a href="Drew%20Barrymore">Drew Barrymore</a> and <a href="Peter%20Coyote">Peter Coyote</a>. The film tells the story of Elliott, a boy who befriends a good-natured extraterrestrial called E.T., who is stranded on Earth. Upon its release, the film became a <a href="Blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbuster</a> and surpassed "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" to become <a href="list%20of%20highest-grossing%20films">the highest-grossing film</a> released to that point. Critics lauded it as a timeless story of friendship, and the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> ranks it as the third greatest science fiction film ever produced in the United States.

Jackson began work on the audiobook of "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" in June 1982—around the same time he began recording his sixth studio album "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>". Quincy Jones served as the producer for both projects, in addition to working as the narrative writer for the audiobook. During the recording of the narration, Jackson became so upset when E.T. died that he wept. Jones and Spielberg both felt that trying to record the part again would not change the pop star's emotional reaction, and decided to leave Jackson's crying in the finished recording. Jackson biographer Lisa D. Campbell wrote that Jones had learned this during the recording of "<a href="She%27s%20Out%20of%20My%20Life">She's Out of My Life</a>" (from the "Off the Wall" album), where the singer also broke down in tears.

Several of the contributors to the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" storybook album had worked with Jackson on his solo projects in the past. <a href="Rod%20Temperton">Rod Temperton</a>, who had written several songs featured on "Off the Wall" and "Thriller", wrote the music for "Someone in the Dark". <a href="Freddy%20DeMann">Freddy DeMann</a> and Ron Weisner, former managers of The Jacksons, served as the production coordinators for the album. <a href="Bruce%20Swedien">Bruce Swedien</a> engineered "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", a task he had performed on "Off the Wall" and "Thriller" and would go on to perform for the albums "<a href="Bad%20%28album%29">Bad</a>" (1987) and "<a href="Dangerous%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Dangerous</a>" (1991). Dick Zimmerman photographed Jackson for the "Thriller" album cover, before again capturing the singer for the accompanying poster to the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" album.

Once the recording and engineering aspects of production had been completed, <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> (the distributor of the album) pressed more than 1 million copies of the audiobook. In 1982, a journalist for "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" wrote that it was one of the "most ambitious" projects that MCA Records had taken on to date.

According to the biography "Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness", written by journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli, the pop singer had shown an early attachment to the story of E.T. After a publicity photo shoot for the soundtrack album in which an <a href="animatronic">animatronic</a> robot of the extraterrestrial character hugged Jackson, the singer stated with wonderment, "He was so real that I was talking to him. I kissed him before I left. The next day, I missed him." Jackson later revealed in the December 1982 issue of "<a href="Ebony%20%28magazine%29">Ebony</a>" magazine—in which both he and E.T. appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why he had such a strong connection to the character:
"He's in a strange place and wants to be accepted—which is a situation that I have found myself in many times when travelling from city to city all over the world. He's most comfortable with children, and I have a great love for kids. He gives love and wants love in return, which is me. And he has that super power which lets him lift off and fly whenever he wants to get away from things on Earth, and I can identify with that. He and I are alike in many ways"
Epic Records allowed Jackson to record the album on two conditions:

MCA Records breached both conditions, releasing the storybook in November 1982 and giving <a href="7-inch">7-inch</a> promo copies of "Someone in the Dark" to radio stations. After Epic lodged a $2 million lawsuit, MCA Records was forced to withdraw the album and prohibited from releasing "Someone in the Dark" as a single. Epic executives had felt that MCA was misleading members of the public into believing that the then-recently released single "<a href="The%20Girl%20Is%20Mine">The Girl Is Mine</a>" was featured on the storybook album. The plaintiffs further requested that MCA Records be banned from working with Jackson in the future and that any other media owned by MCA featuring the singer be prohibited from release.

As a result of the legal restrictions that prohibited the public release of "Someone in the Dark" as a single, the promo copies which were made have since become one of the singer's rarest and most sought-after records; some have been sold for over £1000 ($1587). The song was later included as a bonus track on the 2001 special edition of "Thriller", as well as the box set "<a href="The%20Ultimate%20Collection%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection</a>".

"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" was a commercial success; it reached number 82 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, which was considered high for a storybook album. The audiobook won Jackson a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> in <a href="26th%20Grammy%20Awards">1984</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Album%20for%20Children">Best Recording for Children</a>. Upon collecting the award and taking home a record eight Grammys from an unprecedented twelve nominations, the singer stated that of all the awards had received that night, he was "most proud of this one".

"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" was also well-received critically. Charles L Sanders of "Ebony" magazine described it as an "extraordinary album". Mark Bego of the "<a href="Toledo%20Blade">Toledo Blade</a>" asserted that the song "Someone in the Dark" was "one of the most beautiful ballads" that Jackson had ever recorded. He further commented that the
amalgamation of Jones' production, dialogue from the film, Jackson's "effective and emotional" reading of the narrative and the audiobook's "grand soaring orchestration" made the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" album "[elicit] as many tears as the movie does". A writer for "Billboard" described the audiobook as being "lavishly packaged, lovingly produced" and worth its high asking price. A journalist for the "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald-Leader</a>" concluded that it was a "delightful" storybook album.

FC Porto in international football competitions

<a href="FC%20Porto">Futebol Clube do Porto</a>, an <a href="association%20football">association football</a> team based in <a href="Porto">Porto</a>, is the most decorated Portuguese team in international club competitions. They have won two <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> titles (in <a href="1987%20European%20Cup%20Final">1987</a>, as the European Cup, and <a href="2004%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2004</a>), two <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> titles (in <a href="2003%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">2003</a>, as the UEFA Cup, and <a href="2011%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">2011</a>), one <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> (in <a href="1987%20European%20Super%20Cup">1987</a>), and two <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cups</a> (in <a href="1987%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1987</a> and <a href="2004%20Intercontinental%20Cup">2004</a>), for a total of seven international trophies. In addition, they were <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> runners-up in <a href="1984%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1984</a> – their first European final – and lost three other UEFA Super Cup matches, in <a href="2003%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2003</a>, <a href="2004%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2004</a>, and <a href="2011%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2011</a>.

Porto first participated in international competitions in 1956, when they qualified for the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20European%20Cup">second season</a> of the European Cup as the domestic league winners. They lost their first two European matches against <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> and were eliminated from the competition. Porto then debuted in the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> (not organised by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>) in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1962–63</a>, in the Cup Winners' Cup in <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1964–65</a>, and in the inaugural editions of the UEFA Cup (Fairs Cup successor) and UEFA Champions League (European Cup successor) in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20UEFA%20Cup">1971–72</a> and <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1992–93</a>, respectively. The club has qualified for UEFA competitions every season since 1974–75, and shares with <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> a record 22 appearances in the UEFA Champions League group stage.

Until their <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20European%20Cup">1986–87 European Cup</a> success, Porto were the only of Portugal's "<a href="Big%20Three%20%28Portugal%29">Big Three</a>" teams without international silverware – <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> had won two consecutive European Cup titles in 1961 and 1962, and <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting CP</a> were Cup Winners' Cup victors in 1964. As European champions, Porto contested the UEFA Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup, lifting both trophies in their first appearance. To this date, they remain the only Portuguese team to have won either of these trophies or the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League. As of the end of the 2016–17 season, Porto occupies respectively the eighth and ninth places in the all-time European Cup and UEFA Champions League club rankings, and is the second best-placed Portuguese team in the <a href="UEFA%20coefficient%23UEFA%20team%20ranking">UEFA club ranking</a>.

<a href="Tomislav%20Ivi%C4%87">Tomislav Ivić</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a> are Porto's most decorated <a href="head%20coach">head coach</a>es, each with two international titles. Former Portuguese international goalkeeper and club captain <a href="V%C3%ADtor%20Ba%C3%ADa">Vítor Baía</a> holds the record for the most appearances in international competitions (99), while Colombian striker <a href="Radamel%20Falcao">Radamel Falcao</a> is the club's top goalscorer, with 22 goals.

Porto first participated in international club competitions in 1956, when they took part in the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20European%20Cup">second edition</a> of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>. Qualification for this competition – contested between Europe's national champions – was achieved after Porto secured their fourth <a href="Primeira%20Liga">Primeira Divisão</a> title in the previous season. Their debut was in a preliminary round tie against Spanish champions <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Atlético Bilbao</a>. At their new home ground, the <a href="Est%C3%A1dio%20das%20Antas">Estádio das Antas</a>, Porto lost the first match 2–1 and were eliminated a week later in Bilbao, after a 3–2 defeat.<ref name="1956/57"></ref> Porto returned to this tournament two years later but fell at the same stage.<ref name="1959/60"></ref> After three seasons without qualifying for European competitions, Porto finished the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Primeira%20Divis%C3%A3o">1961–62 league</a> as runners-up and entered the non-UEFA-affiliated <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> for the first time in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1962–63</a>. They were knocked out in the first round by <a href="GNK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb">Dinamo Zagreb</a>, who secured a draw in Yugoslavia after winning in Portugal.<ref name="1962/63"></ref> Porto returned to the Fairs Cup in the following season, but failed to advance past the first round.<ref name="1963/64"></ref>

The <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> was a UEFA competition open to domestic cup winners (or losing finalists, if the winners had already qualified for the European Cup). Porto qualified for this tournament for the first time in <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1964–65</a>, after losing the 1964 <a href="Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal">Portuguese Cup</a> final against champions <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>. Porto progressed from the first round of a European competition for the first time, after a 4–0 <a href="Aggregate%20score">aggregate</a> victory over <a href="Coupe%20de%20France">French Cup</a> winners <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a>, but fell in the next round to <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a>.<ref name="1964/65"></ref> At the end of that season, Porto finished runners-up to Benfica in the league and qualified for the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">following season's Fairs Cup</a>. The club's performance was similar to that of the previous campaign: a first-round elimination of a French team (<a href="Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais%20Paris%20%28football%29">Stade Français</a>) followed by a second-round loss to a German team (<a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a>),<ref name="1965/66"></ref> which included a 5–0 away defeat that was, at the time, Porto's heaviest in Europe. They took part in the Fairs Cup in the following two seasons, but could not progress beyond the first round.<ref name="1966/67"></ref><ref name="1967/68"></ref> In the first case, Porto were eliminated by the <a href="coin%20flipping">flip of a coin</a>, after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Football">extra-time</a> was not enough to break the deadlock with <a href="FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>.

In 1968, the club won their third Portuguese Cup and qualified for the <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1968–69 Cup Winners' Cup</a>. As in previous years, they were unable to get past the second round, losing 4–1 on aggregate to <a href="%C5%A0K%20Slovan%20Bratislava">Slovan Bratislava</a>.<ref name="1968/69"></ref> Porto's last participation in the Fairs Cup, in <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1969–70</a>, also ended in the second round, with a defeat against holders <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>.<ref name="1969/70"></ref> Domestically, Porto finished the league in an all-time low ninth place, thus failing to qualify for European competition in the 1970–71 season. They returned the following season to participate in the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20UEFA%20Cup">inaugural edition</a> of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, which officially replaced the Fairs Cup, but their debut against <a href="FC%20Nantes">Nantes</a> led to another premature exit.<ref name="1971/72"></ref> Porto returned to this tournament in four of the following five seasons, the exception being 1973–74, when it failed qualification for European competitions. In the first of those seasons (<a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20UEFA%20Cup">1972–73</a>), Porto reached the third round of a European competition for the first time, but were eliminated by <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a>.<ref name="1972/73"></ref> They beat <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the first round, in what was the teams' first European encounter and the only time Porto eliminated the Spanish side from European competitions. In the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20UEFA%20Cup">1975–76 UEFA Cup</a>, Porto were again eliminated in the third round, but in the process they beat Luxembourg's <a href="FC%20Avenir%20Beggen">Avenir Beggen</a> with a club record home (7–0) and aggregate (10–0) win scores.<ref name="1975/76"></ref> In the first round of the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20UEFA%20Cup">following season's UEFA Cup</a>, Porto were matched with <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>. After a tie in the first leg, Porto squandered a 2–0 lead in the second leg, conceding three goals in the last 15 minutes, which resulted in their elimination.<ref name="1976/77"></ref>

Head coach <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Maria%20Pedroto">José Maria Pedroto</a> oversaw Porto's victory over <a href="S.C.%20Braga">Braga</a> in the 1977 Portuguese Cup final, which ensured the club's participation in the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1977–78 Cup Winners' Cup</a>. After overcoming <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">Köln</a> in the first round, Porto met <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> for the first time in international club competition.<ref name="1977/78"></ref> Reactions to the second round draw predicted an easy task for the English team, but Porto stunned its visitors and Europe with a 4–0 win. In <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, Manchester United pressed hard and even benefited from two <a href="Own%20goal%23Association%20football">own goals</a>, but their 5–2 win was insufficient to prevent a shocking elimination at the hands of Porto. Playing in a quarter-final round for the first time, they were defeated by the eventual competition winners, <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>.

Porto finished the season at the top of the Primeira Liga, ending a 19-year drought of league titles. In their return to the European Cup, they were eliminated in the first round after suffering their heaviest defeat in European competitions: 6–1 against <a href="AEK%20Athens%20F.C.">AEK Athens</a>.<ref name="1978/79"></ref> Porto secured back-to-back league titles to participate in the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20European%20Cup">1979–80 European Cup</a>. They eliminated <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> in the first round, with a second-leg 1–0 win at <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a>, and advanced to a second-round contest with <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. Two goals from <a href="Fernando%20Gomes%20%28footballer%29">Fernando Gomes</a> granted a 2–1 home win for Porto, but Real's goal proved crucial to secure their qualification on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>, after a 1–0 win in Madrid.<ref name="1979/80"></ref> Porto spent their following five seasons competing either in the UEFA Cup or Cup Winners' Cup. In the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20UEFA%20Cup">1980–81</a> and <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20UEFA%20Cup">1982–83 UEFA Cup</a> editions, Porto was eliminated in the second round by <a href="Grasshopper%20Club%20Z%C3%BCrich">Grasshoppers</a> and Anderlecht, respectively.<ref name="1980/81"></ref><ref name="1982/83"></ref> In between, the club sailed into the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1981–82 Cup Winners' Cup</a> quarter-finals, where they were beaten by the eventual runners-up <a href="Standard%20Li%C3%A8ge">Standard Liège</a>.<ref name="1981/82"></ref>

Porto lost the 1983 Portuguese Cup final to league champions Benfica, which allowed their participation in the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup</a> as losing cup finalists. They eliminated Dinamo Zagreb, <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>, and <a href="FC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a> to reach their first European semi-final.<ref name="1983/84"></ref> The competition draw paired Porto with the holders <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a>, managed by <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>. Taking a 1–0 lead to <a href="Pittodrie%20Stadium">Pittodrie</a>, Porto resisted to the attacking pressure of their opponents. In the 76th minute, <a href="Vermelhinho">Vermelhinho</a> scored the only goal of the match, which confirmed Porto's place in their first European final. "We simply were not good enough against Porto", said Ferguson in the aftermath. This feat was met with such enthusiasm that the plane returning the team to Porto could not land because the runway had been invaded by supporters. <a href="1984%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">The final</a> against <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> was contested at the former <a href="St.%20Jakob%20Stadium">St. Jakob Stadium</a> in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, where Portuguese supporters were a minority. The Italians were the favourites and started off well, taking the lead through <a href="Beniamino%20Vignola">Beniamino Vignola</a> in the 13th minute. Seventeen minutes later, <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20Sousa">António Sousa</a> equalised for Porto, but the Portuguese side could not prevent <a href="Zbigniew%20Boniek">Zbigniew Boniek</a> from scoring Juventus's winning goal just before half-time. Despite the defeat, this final was a stepping stone in the growth of the club's international reputation.

Victory in the 1984 Portuguese Cup final ensured Porto's return to the Cup Winners' Cup in <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1984–85</a>, but they were surprisingly knocked out in the first round by <a href="Welsh%20Cup">Welsh Cup</a> runners-up <a href="Wrexham%20A.F.C.">Wrexham</a>.<ref name="1984/85"></ref> In January 1985, having left his job because of health problems, Pedroto died; he was succeeded by his apprentice <a href="Artur%20Jorge%20%28footballer%29">Artur Jorge</a>. Porto won the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Primeira%20Liga">1984–85 Primeira Liga</a> and qualified for the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20European%20Cup">1985–86 European Cup</a>, where they first beat an <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> side guided by <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a> and featuring <a href="Ronald%20Koeman">Ronald Koeman</a>, <a href="Frank%20Rijkaard">Frank Rijkaard</a> and <a href="Marco%20van%20Basten">Marco van Basten</a>. Porto then faced Barcelona in the second round; after a 2–0 loss at <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a>, <a href="Juary">Juary</a> scored all three goals of Porto's 3–1 win, which was insufficient to avoid elimination on the away goals rule.<ref name="1985/86"></ref>

Porto defended their league title to earn a place in the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20European%20Cup">1986–87 European Cup</a>. They faced Malta's <a href="Rabat%20Ajax%20F.C.">Rabat Ajax</a> in the first round,<ref name="1986/87"></ref> but had to play their home leg away from the Estádio das Antas (in <a href="Vila%20do%20Conde">Vila do Conde</a>), because the pitch was being lowered to increase the stadium capacity. The Maltese suffered a 9–0 defeat, which is still Porto's biggest home win for European competitions. In the second round, they played the Czechoslovak champions <a href="MFK%20V%C3%ADtkovice">TJ Vítkovice</a>; Porto lost 1–0 in <a href="Ostrava">Ostrava</a> but overcame the disadvantage with a 3–0 home win. They then eliminated <a href="Br%C3%B8ndby%20IF">Brøndby</a> of Denmark to advance to the European Cup semi-finals for the first time, where they were drawn against <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a>. The Soviets were considered strong favourites to progress, but Porto won both legs with a 2–1 scoreline and confirmed their second European final in four seasons.

Standing between Porto and the European title were three-time champions <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, who knocked out Real Madrid in the other semi-final and had the odds in their favour. Moreover, Porto's centre-back <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20Lima%20Pereira">Lima Pereira</a> and striker Fernando Gomes had suffered leg injuries and were deemed unfit to play. With <a href="1987%20European%20Cup%20Final">the final</a> scheduled for Vienna's <a href="Praterstadion">Praterstadion</a>, support for the <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>n team far outnumbered that for Porto. Bayern took the lead in the 26th minute through <a href="Ludwig%20K%C3%B6gl">Ludwig Kögl</a> and secured it until the 77th minute, when <a href="Rabah%20Madjer">Rabah Madjer</a>'s backheel equaliser became one of the most memorable goals in European Cup finals. Three minutes later, Madjer provided the cross for Juary's match-deciding volley. This victory was celebrated in Portugal and praised by the European press, which highlighted Porto's second-half resurgence and the key contributions of Madjer, Juary and <a href="Paulo%20Futre">Paulo Futre</a> in the team's success. Having witnessed their Lisbon rivals lift European trophies in the 1960s – Benfica's back-to-back European Cup wins in 1961 and 1962, and <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting</a>'s successful Cup Winners' Cup run in 1964) – this win meant that Porto were no longer the only "<a href="Big%20Three%20%28Portugal%29">Big Three</a>" club in Portugal without international silverware.
Soon after the final, Artur Jorge left Porto to coach French team <a href="Racing%20Club%20de%20France%20football%20Colombes%2092">Matra Racing</a>; his substitute was <a href="Tomislav%20Ivi%C4%87">Tomislav Ivić</a>. As European Cup winners, Porto contested the <a href="1987%20European%20Super%20Cup">1987 European Super Cup</a> against Ajax, the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1986–87 Cup Winners' Cup</a> holders. Porto won the first leg 1–0 in Amsterdam, and two months later repeated the result at home, becoming the competition's first Portuguese winners. In between, Porto traveled to Japan to contest the <a href="1987%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1987 Intercontinental Cup</a> against the <a href="1987%20Copa%20Libertadores">1987 Copa Libertadores</a> winners, <a href="Pe%C3%B1arol">Peñarol</a> of Uruguay. A severe snowstorm hit Tokyo on the day of the match, which nearly forced its postponement. Despite the poor weather conditions, the game went ahead. Porto took the lead just before half-time but conceded the equaliser in the final minutes of the second half. In extra-time, Madjer lobbed a ball from the midfield over Peñarol's goalkeeper; it landed on the snow a few feet away from the goal line, but with enough impulse to roll into the goal and secure Porto's (and Portugal's) first <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> title.

As holders, Porto were automatically qualified for the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20European%20Cup">1987–88 European Cup</a>, but their previous season's success was not emulated as they were eliminated in the second round by Real Madrid.<ref name="1987/88"></ref> Ivić departed with a league title and Artur Jorge was brought back with the 1988–89 season underway. In the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20European%20Cup">1988–89 European Cup</a>, Porto were knocked out by the holders, <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV Eindhoven</a>, after a heavy 5–0 away defeat.<ref name="1988/89"></ref> Finishing second in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Primeira%20Liga">1988–89 Primeira Liga</a>, Porto entered the UEFA Cup, seven years after their last participation. They eliminated <a href="CSM%20Flac%C4%83ra%20Moreni">Flacăra Moreni</a> of Romania and <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>, before falling in the third round to <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburg</a>.<ref name="1989/90"></ref> Returning to the European Cup in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20European%20Cup">1990–91</a>, Porto began their campaign beating the Northern Irish champions <a href="Portadown%20F.C.">Portadown</a> (13–1 on aggregate, including an 8–1 away win, the club's biggest in European competitions) and <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Dinamo București</a> (4–0). In the quarter-finals, they faced Bayern Munich for the first time since the 1987 final. After securing a 1–1 draw in Munich, Porto were beaten 2–0 at home.<ref name="1990/91"></ref>

Porto entered the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1991–92 Cup Winners' Cup</a> following their seventh Portuguese Cup final win in mid-1991, but their campaign ended in the second round against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham</a>.<ref name="1991/92"></ref> In the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1992–93 season</a>, UEFA renamed the European Cup to UEFA Champions League and confirmed the introduction of a <a href="Round-robin%20tournament">round-robin</a> group stage, tested in the previous season. Apart from <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1994–95</a>, when they competed for the last time in the Cup Winners' Cup – being eliminated on penalties in the quarter-finals against <a href="U.C.%20Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a><ref name="1994/95"></ref> – Porto were present in every edition of the Champions League from its founding season to 1999–2000. In the first edition, Porto overcame two preliminary rounds to reach the group stage, where they played <a href="IFK%20G%C3%B6teborg">IFK Göteborg</a>, Milan, and PSV Eindhoven. Two wins in six matches resulted in a third place in the group and failure to progress to the final (only accessible for the group winners).<ref name="1992/93"></ref> They returned the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">following season</a> to the group stage and were drawn against Anderlecht, <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>, and Milan. Buoyed by a 5–0 away defeat of the Germans, Porto secured the group's runner-up place and a semi-final meeting with Barcelona. The one-legged tie was drawn to take place at Camp Nou, and ended with a 3–0 victory for the home side.<ref name="1993/94"></ref>

The <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1995–96 UEFA Champions League</a> participation was short-lived as Porto finished outside of their group's top two places.<ref name="1995/96"></ref> The <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">following season</a>, they were drawn into a group with Milan for the third time in four participations. Having failed to beat the Italians in their previous meetings, Porto were on the verge of suffering another defeat in San Siro, as they trailed Milan by 2–1 with 20 minutes to go. However, two goals by <a href="M%C3%A1rio%20Jardel">Mário Jardel</a> overturned the score and sealed the win for Porto. They were confirmed as group winners after victories over IFK Göteborg and <a href="Rosenborg%20BK">Rosenborg</a>. In the quarter-finals, they fell to Manchester United after a 4–0 away loss.<ref name="1996/97"></ref> Porto did not progress past the group stage of the two subsequent Champions League seasons, coming last in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1997–98</a> and third in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1998–99</a>.<ref name="1997/98"></ref><ref name="1998/99"></ref> The club got back on track in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1999–2000</a> season, overcoming two consecutive group stages to meet Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals.<ref name="1999/2000"></ref> Having drawn 1–1 in Portugal, Bayern took an early lead in the second leg; Porto leveled the score in the 88th minute, but one minute later, the Germans scored the winning goal.

Sporting won the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Primeira%20Liga">1999–2000 Primeira Liga</a> and ended Porto's chances to clinch a record sixth consecutive title. As runners-up, Porto had to go through a qualifying round to reach the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2000–01 UEFA Champions League</a> group stage. However, a loss to Anderlecht meant elimination and consequent transfer into <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Cup">that season's UEFA Cup</a>,<ref name="2000/01cl"></ref> where they were beaten in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>.<ref name="2000/01uc"></ref> Having lost the 2000–01 season's league title to city rivals <a href="Boavista%20F.C.">Boavista</a>, Porto had to start their <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2001–02 Champions League</a> participation in the second qualifying round. They defeated Welsh side <a href="Barry%20Town%20United%20F.C.">Barry Town</a> and Grasshoppers to reach the first group stage, where they finished runners-up to Juventus. In the second group stage, Porto registered four losses in six matches, finishing in the fourth and last place.<ref name="2001/02"></ref> Domestically, the club concluded the league in third place, just outside the Champions League qualification places. Midway through the season, Porto sacked coach <a href="Oct%C3%A1vio%20Machado">Octávio Machado</a> and hired 38-year-old Portuguese coach <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>, who had led <a href="U.D.%20Leiria">Leiria</a> to their best-ever league finish.

Sitting fifth in the league, Porto consolidated their performances following Mourinho's arrival and registered a win–draw–loss record of 11–2–2 to climb to third place and qualify for the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Cup">2002–03 UEFA Cup</a>. They progressed through the first four rounds with convincing wins, suffering only one defeat against French side <a href="RC%20Lens">Lens</a>.<ref name="2002/03"></ref> In the quarter-finals, Porto were surprised at home with a 1–0 home defeat against <a href="Panathinaikos%20F.C.">Panathinaikos</a>. In Athens, <a href="Derlei">Derlei</a> scored in the 16th minute to tie the round, and added a second goal in the first half of extra-time to propel Porto into the semi-finals. Facing <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a> at home for the first leg, Porto conceded an early goal by <a href="Claudio%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28footballer%29">Claudio López</a>. A few minutes later, <a href="Maniche">Maniche</a>'s equaliser sparked a strong attacking display by the home team, which scored a further three goals to secure a significant advantage for the second leg. In Rome, a goalless draw confirmed Porto's presence in their third major European competition final, the first since their 1987 European Cup victory. Their opponents were <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>, who had eliminated Boavista in the other semi-final to advance to their first European final since <a href="1970%20European%20Cup%20Final">1970</a>.

Scheduled for 21 May 2003 at <a href="Seville">Seville</a>'s <a href="Estadio%20de%20La%20Cartuja">Estadio Olímpico</a>, the <a href="2003%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">2003 UEFA Cup Final</a> took place under an intense heat, which did not dissuade a 53,000-strong crowd of supporters, mostly in favour of the Scottish team. A contested first half was heading into half-time when, during injury time, Derlei put Porto ahead. Soon after the restart, <a href="Henrik%20Larsson">Henrik Larsson</a> headed Celtic's equaliser, but <a href="Dmitri%20Alenichev">Dmitri Alenichev</a> restored Porto's lead a few minutes later. Larsson again leveled the score, sending the match into extra-time. Despite <a href="Bobo%20Bald%C3%A9">Baldé</a>'s dismissal in the first half of extra-time, Celtic held on until the 115th minute, when Derlei intercepted a blocked shot and beat the goalkeeper to score the winning goal. His 12th goal in the competition confirmed him as the top scorer (ahead of Larsson), and inscribed Porto (and Portugal) into the <a href="List%20of%20UEFA%20Cup%20and%20Europa%20League%20finals">list of UEFA Cup winners</a>, for the first time. With their first Primeira Liga title in four years mathematically confirmed two weeks ahead of the Seville final, Mourinho then led Porto to victory in the Portuguese Cup final, against his former club, Leiria, to conclude a <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a>-winning season.
In late August, Porto kicked off their 2003–04 European season with a loss in the <a href="2003%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2003 UEFA Super Cup</a> match against the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2002–03 UEFA Champions League</a> winners, Milan. Two weeks later, they began their <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2003–04 UEFA Champions League</a> campaign in a group comprising Real Madrid, <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a>, and <a href="FK%20Partizan">Partizan</a>. Porto qualified for the knockout phase as group runners-up, behind Real Madrid, who inflicted their only group stage defeat. The draw for the round of 16 paired Porto with Manchester United, with the first leg taking place in Portugal. In the first European club competition match at the <a href="Est%C3%A1dio%20do%20Drag%C3%A3o">Estádio do Dragão</a>, Porto won 2–1 with goals from <a href="Benni%20McCarthy">Benni McCarthy</a>.<ref name="2003/04"></ref> At Old Trafford, <a href="Paul%20Scholes">Paul Scholes</a> put the English side ahead in the match and in the round (advantage on away goals). On the brink of elimination, Porto earned a free kick in the 90th minute; McCarthy's shot was blocked near the line by goalkeeper <a href="Tim%20Howard">Tim Howard</a>, but <a href="Costinha">Costinha</a> caught the rebound and scored the equaliser that took Porto through to the next round. In the quarter-finals, they overcame another French team (Lyon) to advance to the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 1994. Porto faced <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo La Coruña</a>, who had convincingly eliminated the previous season's finalists, Juventus and Milan. A goalless first leg match in Portugal postponed the decision to the <a href="Estadio%20Riazor">Estadio Riazor</a>, where a penalty kick converted by Derlei confirmed Porto's second major European final in two consecutive seasons. The other finalists were <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">AS Monaco</a>, who had eliminated Real Madrid and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>.

The <a href="Arena%20AufSchalke">Arena AufSchalke</a> in <a href="Gelsenkirchen">Gelsenkirchen</a> hosted <a href="2004%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">the final</a>, which provided one of the most lopsided results in <a href="List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals">European Cup and Champions League finals</a>, as Porto defeated Monaco 3–0. Despite the score, Monaco were a pressing side and started off better with dangerous incursions into Porto's <a href="penalty%20area">penalty area</a> by captain <a href="Ludovic%20Giuly">Ludovic Giuly</a>, who was replaced midway through the first half due to injury. In the 38th minute, <a href="Carlos%20Alberto%20de%20Jesus">Carlos Alberto</a> opened the score for Porto. Despite one goal behind and without playmaker Giuly, Monaco created chances in the second half, but Alenichev and <a href="Deco">Deco</a> set each other up for the second and third goals, respectively. Porto won UEFA's premier competition for the second time and became the second club to win the UEFA Cup and the European Champion Club's Cup in consecutive seasons, after Liverpool's 1975–76 UEFA Cup and 1976–77 European Cup wins. This was Mourinho's last match for Porto; a week later, he was presented as Chelsea's manager.

Champions League success struck a hard blow in the team, which saw its influential coach and key players leave to clubs from prominent European leagues. To replace Mourinho, Porto signed <a href="Luigi%20Delneri">Luigi Delneri</a> but the Italian was sacked before overseeing an official match, and his place was taken by <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Víctor Fernández</a>. His tenure did not start off well, as Porto lost the <a href="2004%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> for the second time in two years, going down 2–1 against Valencia. Filling the Champions League title-holder spot in the group stage of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">following season's tournament</a>, Porto were drawn together with Chelsea, which meant Mourinho's return to the Estádio do Dragão. In the last group match, they hosted the Londoners in need of a win to assure qualification. As <a href="Damien%20Duff">Damien Duff</a> put Chelsea ahead, Porto were at risk of becoming the first holders not to get past the group stage, but goals from <a href="Diego%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201985%29">Diego</a> and McCarthy saved Porto from premature elimination. Nevertheless, the defending champions were subsequently knocked out in the round of 16, after losing 4–2 on aggregate against <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter</a>.<ref name="2004/05"></ref> Before this tie, Porto returned to Japan to contest the <a href="2004%20Intercontinental%20Cup">last edition of the Intercontinental Cup</a>, 17 years after their first triumph. They dominated Colombia's <a href="Once%20Caldas">Once Caldas</a> for most of the 90 minutes plus extra-time, but were unable to score. It took 18 <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">kicks from the penalty mark</a> to decide the match 8–7 for Porto and give the club their second and last title in this competition.
Despite the managerial instability – Fernández was replaced by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Couceiro">José Couceiro</a> soon after their Champions League elimination – and weak performances in league matches, Porto finished runners-up to Benfica and secured qualification for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2005–06 UEFA Champions League</a> group stage. Dutch coach <a href="Co%20Adriaanse">Co Adriaanse</a> was appointed as the new coach for the 2005–06 season, and although his team delivered domestically – reclaiming both Portuguese league and Cup titles – it disappointed in the Champions League, as Porto finished last of their group, with one win and three losses.<ref name="2005/06"></ref> In reaction to Adriaanse's resignation in the summer of 2006, the club signed experienced coach <a href="Jesualdo%20Ferreira">Jesualdo Ferreira</a> from Boavista. Porto qualified from <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage%23Group%20G">their Champions League group</a> with the same points as Arsenal, but behind on <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Group%20stage">head-to-head standings</a>. Paired with Chelsea in the round of 16, Porto drew the first leg match in Portugal but were eliminated with a 2–1 loss in London.<ref name="2006/07"></ref>

Porto won three consecutive Primeira Liga titles with Ferreira, ensuring their presence in the three subsequent Champions League seasons. In <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2007–08</a>, Porto fell again in the round of 16, losing to Schalke 04 in a penalty shootout.<ref name="2007/08"></ref> In the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">following season</a>'s round of 16, they eliminated <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> on away goals and progressed to a quarter-final tie with Manchester United. A two-all draw in Manchester gave Porto the upper hand in the round, but a <a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> goal in the opening minutes of the return leg ended their European run.<ref name="2008/09"></ref> The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2009–10 UEFA Champions League</a> season was Ferreira's last in charge of Porto, and like in previous years, he successfully guided the team past the group stage. In the round of 16, a 2–1 home win over Arsenal was obliterated by a 5–0 defeat in London, which included a hat-trick from <a href="Nicklas%20Bendtner">Nicklas Bendtner</a>.<ref name="2009/10"></ref> Domestically, Porto failed to win a fifth consecutive league title and their third-place finish excluded them from competing in the 2010–11 Champions League. However, victory in the Portuguese Cup final confirmed the club's entry in the play-off round of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2010–11 UEFA Europa League</a>.

Ferreira stepped down at the end of the 2009–10 season and was replaced by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Villas-Boas">André Villas-Boas</a>, a former assistant of Mourinho at Porto, Chelsea, and Internazionale. In a single season, Villas-Boas guided the team to a record-matching four titles, including victory in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. Their triumphant campaign started in the play-off round, where they overcame Belgian side <a href="K.R.C.%20Genk">Genk</a> to reach the group stage. Porto topped their group undefeated, only dropping points against <a href="Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K.">Beşiktaş</a>. In the round of 32, despite a second-leg home loss, they eliminated the 2005–06 and 2006–07 UEFA Cup winners <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, setting up a tie with CSKA Moscow. Porto defeated the Russians in both legs and advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were paired against another <a href="Moscow">Muscovite</a> club, this time <a href="FC%20Spartak%20Moscow">Spartak Moscow</a>. Two prolific displays, which included a <a href="Hat-trick%23Association%20football">hat-trick</a> by <a href="Radamel%20Falcao">Radamel Falcao</a>, sealed a 10–3 aggregate win for Porto. In the semi-finals, Falcao went one better and scored four goals in a first-leg 5–1 win against <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>, which all but confirmed the club's fourth major European final.<ref name="2010/11"></ref> The <a href="2011%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">Dublin final</a> was an all-Portuguese affair between Porto and Primeira Liga rivals Braga. Contrasting with previous matches in the tournament, Porto's performance was more contained and victory was secured with a single goal by Falcao, who became the competition's top scorer.

In June 2011, Villas-Boas left Porto to become Chelsea's manager. He took his technical staff to London, except his assistant coach <a href="V%C3%ADtor%20Pereira%20%28football%20manager%29">Vítor Pereira</a>, who became the club's new coach.

She is a descendant of <a href="Maurice%20Koechlin">Maurice Koechlin</a>, a French structural engineer who played an important role in the design and construction of the <a href="Eiffel%20Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>. Koechlin's parents are devotees of <a href="Sri%20Aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a>, and she spent a significant amount of her early childhood in <a href="Auroville">Auroville</a>. The family later settled in Kallatty, a village near <a href="Ooty">Ooty</a> in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, where Koechlin's father established a business designing hang-gliders and ultralight aircraft.

Koechlin was brought up in a strict environment in Ooty where she spoke <a href="English%20language">English</a>, <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>, and <a href="French%20language">French</a>. Her parents divorced when she was fifteen; her father moved to <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> and remarried, while Koechlin continued living with her mother. She has described the time that she spent at Kalatty between the ages of 5 and 8, before her parents' divorce, as her "happiest". Koechlin has a half-brother from her mother's previous marriage, and a half-brother from her father's subsequent marriage.

Koechlin studied at <a href="Hebron%20School%2C%20Ooty">Hebron School</a>, a boarding school in Ooty, where she was involved in acting and writing. She has admitted to being shy and quiet as a child.

She worked as a waitress on weekends.

After completing her studies, Koechlin moved back to India and lived with her maternal half-brother in Bangalore. Unable to find work there, she moved to <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, where she worked with <a href="theatre%20director">theatre director</a>s and with Atul Kumar and Ajay Krishnan, the founders of a Mumbai-based theatre company called "The Company Theatre". They were looking for actors for a theatrical festival, "Contacting the World", to be held in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>.

After moving to Mumbai, Koechlin auditioned for <a href="Anurag%20Kashyap">Anurag Kashyap</a>'s "<a href="Dev.D">Dev.D</a>" (2009), a modern-day adaptation of <a href="Sarat%20Chandra%20Chattopadhyay">Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay</a>'s 1917 Bengali novel "<a href="Devdas">Devdas</a>". In the film, Koechlin plays the role of Leni, a young woman who turns to prostitution after a leaked sex tape scandal. The character was based on <a href="Chandramukhi%20%28character%29">Chandramukhi</a>, a pivotal character in the novel, a prostitute who fell in love with the titular character. Kashyap initially rejected Koechlin as she was not Indian, and did not match his visualisation of the character. But he changed his mind and offered her the role after seeing her audition tape. The film met with generally positive reviews and was a box office success. Koechlin garnered praise and a <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress</a> for her performance, which was described as "imbued [...] with a touching fragility" and "astonishingly [appropriate]". Others were more impressed by her character's complexity, but thought of Koechlin's performance in the film's first half as amateurish.

Koechlin played a supporting role in the black comedy "<a href="The%20Film%20Emotional%20Atyachar">The Film Emotional Atyachar</a>", her only film appearance of 2010. Co-starring <a href="Ranvir%20Shorey">Ranvir Shorey</a>, <a href="Mohit%20Ahlawat%20%28actor%29">Mohit Ahlawat</a>, <a href="Abhimanyu%20Singh">Abhimanyu Singh</a>, <a href="Vinay%20Pathak">Vinay Pathak</a>, and <a href="Ravi%20Kishan">Ravi Kishan</a>, the production opened to mixed reviews. Her performance as Sophie, a manipulative woman who is abducted by two corrupt policemen, garnered mixed reviews from critics. <a href="Komal%20Nahta">Komal Nahta</a> of <a href="Koimoi">Koimoi</a> labeled her performance as average, while Blessyy Chettiar of "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" felt that she was underused. Koechlin had committed to star in "I am Afia", one of the four short films of <a href="Onir">Onir</a>'s anthology "<a href="I%20Am%20%282010%20Indian%20film%29">I Am</a>", but it went into production with a modified plot for the segment. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28Calcutta%29">The Telegraph</a>" Onir said, "as we discussed the subject more and more, both Kalki and me felt that the narrative was becoming too hurried in the 25-minute limit". Koechlin, who was to play the role of an NGO worker in the film was ultimately replaced by <a href="Nandita%20Das">Nandita Das</a>, after the change of plot.

After facing some early struggle for film roles, Koechlin had four releases in 2011, garnering widespread recognition for her performances in them. The first was <a href="Bejoy%20Nambiar">Bejoy Nambiar</a>'s "<a href="Shaitan%20%28film%29">Shaitan</a>", a crime-thriller with an ensemble cast that included Koechlin, <a href="Rajeev%20Khandelwal">Rajeev Khandelwal</a>, <a href="Gulshan%20Devaiya">Gulshan Devaiya</a>, <a href="Shiv%20Pandit">Shiv Pandit</a>, Neil Bhoopalam, and <a href="Kirti%20Kulhari">Kirti Kulhari</a>. She played the role of a disturbed teenager and called it an exhausting experience, saying that she felt drained while trying to, "get into a psyche of someone who does a lot of drugs and booze, has lost her mind a little bit and is very vulnerable". While the character was inconsistently described by film critics as "a nightmare" and "engaging", Koechlin was unanimously praised for her performance, with <a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> calling her "an increasingly striking actress". Upon release the film received positive reviews from critics, and Koechlin was nominated for the Best Actress Award at the <a href="Star%20Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Star Screen Awards</a>.

Koechlin then starred in <a href="Zoya%20Akhtar">Zoya Akhtar</a>'s <a href="coming-of-age%20film">coming-of-age</a> comedy "<a href="Zindagi%20Na%20Milegi%20Dobara">Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</a>". Akhtar had expressed her wish to work with Koechlin in a prior interview with <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a>, having seen her in "Dev.D" and the then-unreleased "<a href="That%20Girl%20in%20Yellow%20Boots">That Girl in Yellow Boots</a>". She played the role of Natasha, a South Bombay girl who works as an interior designer. Koechlin, who took diction classes for the role which required her to speak accented <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>, revealed that she was keen to do the film because her work in such projects as "Dev.D" and "Shaitan" had led her to being <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> in dark roles of prostitutes, troubled teenagers, and misfits. With the worldwide collections of , "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara" was a blockbuster hit and became, at the time, the ninth highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time. Koechlin's performance was well received by critics. Gaurav Malani of "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" deemed her "excellent", and Raja Sen in his review for Rediff.com noted her as "histrionically strong enough to manage varied roles". Koechlin also received her second Filmfare Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role.

Koechlin expanded her career into screenwriting with Anurag Kashyap's 2011 thriller "That Girl in Yellow Boots". She said that Kashyap asked her to write the script for the film as he was looking for a woman's perspective for the story. Co-starring with <a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a>, the film had her play a British woman name Ruth, who travels to Mumbai in search of her biological father. The role was partially based on her own experience as a 'white-girl' in India. Shot in a short duration of thirteen days, the film was screened at the <a href="2010%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2010 Toronto International Film Festival</a> and the <a href="67th%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">67th Venice International Film Festival</a>, among other venues. It opened to critical acclaim, with Koechlin being widely praised for her performance. Giving the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote that Koechlin "creates a memorable woman who is sad and old beyond her years". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com described Koechlin as "unrestrained and uncorrupted". NDTV film critic Saibal Chatterjee also lauded the film and deemed her performance as "absolute perfection". Koechlin's final release of the year was the <a href="Sanjay%20Leela%20Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a>-produced comedy "<a href="My%20Friend%20Pinto">My Friend Pinto</a>".

The film, which was based on the Greek writer <a href="Vassilis%20Vassilikos">Vassilis Vassilikos</a>'s 1967 novel "Z" (made into a <a href="Z%20%281969%20film%29">movie of the same name</a>), premiered at the <a href="2012%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2012 Toronto Film Festival</a>. Koechlin found the role of a political activist, which she described as vulnerable and awkward to be challenging. She said that the character was, "someone who is not an accepted person [...] an outsider". "Shanghai" received positive reviews from critics, and was a surprise hit at the box-office grossing over worldwide. Koechlin garnered a mixed response for her performance in the film. While Russell Edwards noted the "biting edge" she brought to the role, Aniruddha Guha thought of her as the "weakest link" in the film.

Koechlin's continued association with commercial films sustained her success as seen, in varying degrees, with both of her 2013 releases, the supernatural thriller "<a href="Ek%20Thi%20Daayan">Ek Thi Daayan</a>" and the comedy drama "<a href="Yeh%20Jawaani%20Hai%20Deewani">Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</a>". The former was based on "Mobius Trips", a short story written by Mukul Sharma, the father of <a href="Konkona%20Sen%20Sharma">Konkona Sen Sharma</a>, who also starred in the film.

Praising Koechlin in her review for the film, critic <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> remarked that she was, "an interesting actor but the film doesn't know what to do with her".

Koechlin then went on to star in "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani", co-starring <a href="Deepika%20Padukone">Deepika Padukone</a>, <a href="Ranbir%20Kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a> and <a href="Aditya%20Roy%20Kapur">Aditya Roy Kapur</a>. She played the role of <a href="tomboy">tomboy</a>, Aditi Mehra. Koechlin, who was nursing her hospitalised mother and simultaneously filming for the project called it a "really tough time". Nonetheless, she described her time on the film sets as "fun", and developed a close friendship with Padukone. The film emerged as <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films">one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films</a> with earnings of . Koechlin was lauded for her performance and comic timing, with <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a>'s Rajeev Masand writing, "Koechlin invests heart and spunkiness to the part". She earned her third Filmfare Best Supporting Actress nomination.

Later in 2013, Koechlin appeared in a video entitled "<a href="It%27s%20Your%20Fault%20%28video%29">It's Your Fault</a>", along with <a href="Video%20jockey">VJ</a> Juhi Pandey. Dealing with the issue of sexual assaults on women, the video mocks the mindset that blames women for provoking rapes. It was created by <a href="All%20India%20Bakchod">All India Bakchod</a>, and was released on their <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channel. "It's Your Fault" went viral, with over 150,000 views in two days. Koechlin's sole release in 2014 was <a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a>'s "<a href="Happy%20Ending%20%28film%29">Happy Ending</a>", where she plays a comic role of a girl obsessed with Khan's character. She credited her performance in "Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani" for landing her the role. She said that people noticed her comic timing in the film, and that worked in her favour. The film, which Koechlin described as "spoof on our film industry and on all the romantic comedies", opened to mixed reviews and was a box-office failure. Despite the film's mixed reception she garnered praise for her performance. Saurabh Dwivedi of "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" wrote that "Koechlin steals the show with her perfect portrayal of a nagging girlfriend", and Rohit Vats of "Hindustan Times" noted that, although her character in the film felt a bit forced, she delivered a "charming" performance.

Koechlin starred in <a href="Shonali%20Bose">Shonali Bose</a>'s drama "<a href="Margarita%20with%20a%20Straw">Margarita with a Straw</a>", playing Laila, a young woman with <a href="cerebral%20palsy">cerebral palsy</a> who leaves her home in India to study in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, unexpectedly falls in love, and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Her character was inspired by <a href="Malini%20Chib">Malini Chib</a>, Bose's cousin. Bose first approached Koechlin, who she said was her "first and only choice", for the role when the latter was shooting for "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewaani". Due to the clashing schedule Bose went on to audition other actresses to substitute Koechlin, but felt that "something was missing" in each one, and she eventually decided to push the filming for three months to accommodate her. In an interview with the "Times of India", Koechlin acknowledged that the role was the most challenging of her film career, and she took six months off her filming schedule to prepare for it. She underwent a six-week training workshop with actor <a href="Adil%20Hussain">Adil Hussain</a>. The workshop aimed at making her "body language seem natural", while also focusing on the speech pattern of patients with cerebral palsy. Koechlin spent considerable time with Chib and her physiotherapist and speech therapist. She also attended a month-long workshop in Delhi, where she worked on the movement of the body parts. Although the film covers aspects of physical disability, Koechlin dubbed it "a romcom with some hurdles".

While Leslie Felperin of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" made a detailed note of her "bravura performance in both physical and emotional terms", NDTV film critic Saibal Chatterjee straightforwardly deemed her "absolutely brilliant". "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>"'s Deepanjana Pal ascribed her screen appeal to her lack of acting pretense, and wrote "[Koechlin] has done a good job of miming the physicality [...] but what is truly remarkable is the lack of artifice in her expressions". John Beifuss compared her performance to <a href="Eddie%20Redmayne">Eddie Redmayne</a>'s act as <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> in the biographical drama, "<a href="The%20Theory%20of%20Everything%20%282014%20film%29">The Theory of Everything</a>", in his review for "<a href="The%20Commercial%20Appeal">The Commercial Appeal</a>." He gave Koechlin the highest praise writing that her performance would have attracted <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> notice in a <a href="major%20film%20studio">major film studio</a> production. The view was echoed by <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety"</a> critic Guy Lodge, who was particularly impressed by her range.

In response to the poem, Ishita Sengupta of "The Indian Express" suggested a <a href="open%20text">re-reading</a> of the fairy tales "in a new light".

Koechlin began working on a <a href="podcast">podcast</a> for <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in 2018. Entitled "My Indian Life", the series had its debut on the streaming networks on 4 August.

On 13 November 2013 Koechlin and Kashyap issued a joint statement addressing their separation. On 19 May 2015, they filed for divorce at a Mumbai family court. During the period between their separation and eventual divorce, the couple went through marriage counselling.

Since her divorce, she has rarely mentioned her personal life in public. <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">Tabloids</a> have often linked her romantically with other Bollywood stars, but she has strongly denied any such rumours.

After the separation Koechlin discussed her struggles in an interview with "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>", "Even as an actor, you have days when you haven't slept enough, you don't feel like you're good enough or pretty enough ... But ultimately, it's all about attitude. You must live with a little abandon and not be self-conscious. You ought to stop staring at yourself in the mirror, and just smile a little!" Having suffered through <a href="racism">racial prejudice</a> in her teenage years and early film career, when she was stereotyped as a 'white-girl' in India, Koechlin advocates for an anti-racist ideology. She acknowledged her share of confusion regarding her identity as a "white-skinned woman growing up in Tamil Nadu", who had to defend her "Indian-ness" at numerous occasions. Later in 2012, she said of herself, “My skin is white, but my heart is brown.” She has a <a href="French%20passport">French passport</a>, and stated in an interview that she chose it over an <a href="Indian%20passport">Indian passport</a> as it is easier to travel with the former.

Koechlin has been acknowledged in the media for her unconventional roles in films and her straightforward personality. Reviewing her work in "Printing Machine", film critic and journalist <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> deemed her the "free-thinking actress this industry [Bollywood] needs". Megha Shah of the "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" called her "someone who can speak her mind, sound intelligent and also look stunning in a bikini". Members of the media have subsequently labelled her as a role model for women across the country. Bhavya Sadhwani, describing her as "a real life heroine", lauded her for "voicing her opinions without an iota of inhibition". Another editorial in "<a href="The%20Week%20%28Indian%20magazine%29">The Week</a>" stated that with her powerful performances, and by voicing her opinions, she "has always stayed ahead of her contemporaries in the industry".
Following her portrayal of such characters as those in "Dev.D", "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara", "Shaitan", and "Margarita With a Straw", Koechlin gained wider recognition and earned the tag of a "nonconformist". Clarisse Loughrey of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" described her as a pioneer for the Indian film industry owing to her unconventional roles and outspoken public presence. Don Groves of "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" wrote that she has "managed to subvert stereotypes by playing characters who are nothing like each other". The columnist and film critic <a href="Vinayak%20Chakravorty">Vinayak Chakravorty</a> cites Koechlin as one of the "new 'new wave' actors" who has proved her easy screen presence in her short time in the film industry.

Koechlin is described as a style icon by the Indian media and has been dubbed as the "queen of experimental fashion". Raedita Tandan of "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" deemed Koechlin's fashion appeal as "effortless" and "un-diva esque". Such designers and photographers as the slow-process multimedia artist Riyas Komu and "<a href="Elle%20%28India%29">Elle</a>" couturier Amit Aggarwal have described Koechlin's persona as representative of "a sense of eclecticism" and "fresh, akin to a new wave" respectively. Koechlin has been a part of numerous fashion shows, including the <a href="Lakme%20Fashion%20Week">Lakme Fashion Week</a>, India International Jewellery Week, and Mijwan Fashion Show (<a href="Shabana%20Azmi">Shabana Azmi</a>'s annual fund raiser). She also made a guest appearance at the <a href="Milan%20Fashion%20Week">Milan Fashion Week</a>, one of the global "Big Four Fashion Weeks".

Koechlin is particularly known in the Indian media and film industry for her dedication to her work. Atul Kumar, founder of The Company Theatre, and her co-star in "Hamlet", noted: "[h]er commitment as an actor is relentless". The director Shonali Bose, while filming "Margarita With a Straw", said Koechlin was able to give perfect <a href="long%20take">long take</a>s for the film because of the "intense hard work that she put into the preparation of her role". Her former husband, Anurag Kashyap—who directed her in three films—believes that she "has grown as an actor since "Dev D."". <a href="Rajat%20Kapoor">Rajat Kapoor</a>, in whose "Hamlet" Koechlin performed as <a href="Ophelia">Ophelia</a>, believes she is an actress who has the "sensitivity and understanding of filmmaking and theatre".

Gliding

Gliding is a recreational activity and competitive <a href="air%20sports">air sport</a> in which pilots fly <a href="glider%20aircraft">unpowered aircraft</a> known as <a href="Glider%20%28sailplane%29">gliders</a> or sailplanes using naturally occurring currents of rising air in the atmosphere to remain airborne. The word "soaring" is also used for the sport.

Gliding as a sport began in the 1920s. Initially the objective was to increase the duration of flights but soon pilots attempted cross-country flights away from the place of launch. Improvements in aerodynamics and in the understanding of weather phenomena have allowed greater distances at higher average speeds. Long distances are now flown using any of the main sources of rising air: <a href="Ridge%20Lift">ridge lift</a>, <a href="thermal">thermal</a>s and <a href="lee%20waves">lee waves</a>. When conditions are favourable, experienced pilots can now fly hundreds of kilometres before returning to their home airfields; occasionally flights of more than are achieved.

Some competitive pilots fly in races around pre-defined courses. These <a href="gliding%20competitions">gliding competitions</a> test pilots' abilities to make best use of local weather conditions as well as their flying skills. Local and national competitions are organized in many countries, and there are biennial <a href="World%20Gliding%20Championships">World Gliding Championships</a>.
Techniques to maximize a glider's speed around the day's task in a competition have been developed, including the optimum <a href="speed%20to%20fly">speed to fly</a>, navigation using <a href="global%20positioning%20system">GPS</a> and the carrying of water <a href="Sailing%20ballast">ballast</a>. If the weather deteriorates pilots are sometimes unable to complete a cross-country flight. Consequently, they may need to land elsewhere, perhaps in a field, but <a href="motorglider">motorglider</a> pilots can avoid this by starting an engine.

Powered-aircraft and winches are the two most common means of launching gliders. These and other launch methods require assistance and facilities such as airfields, tugs, and winches. These are usually provided by gliding clubs who also train new pilots and maintain high safety standards. Although in most countries the standards of safety of the pilots and the aircraft are the responsibility of governmental bodies, the clubs and sometimes <a href="national%20gliding%20associations">national gliding associations</a> often have delegated authority.

The development of heavier-than-air flight in the half century between <a href="Sir%20George%20Cayley%27s%20coachman">Sir George Cayley's coachman</a> in 1853 and the <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wright brothers</a> in 1903 mainly involved gliders (see <a href="Aviation%20history">Aviation history</a>). However, the sport of gliding only emerged after the First World War, as a result of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Germany's Weimar Republic</a>. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers in the rest of the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.
The first German gliding competition was held at the <a href="Wasserkuppe">Wasserkuppe</a> in 1920, organized by <a href="Oskar%20Ursinus">Oskar Ursinus</a>. The best flight lasted two minutes and set a world distance record of . Within ten years, it had become an international event in which the achieved durations and distances had increased greatly. In 1931, Gunther Grönhoff flew on the front of a storm from <a href="Munich">Munich</a> to <a href="Kada%C5%88">Kadaň</a> (Kaaden in German) in Western <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, farther than had been thought possible.
In the 1930s, gliding spread to many other countries. In the <a href="Gliding%20at%20the%201936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a> in Berlin gliding was a <a href="demonstration%20sport">demonstration sport</a>, and it was scheduled to be a full Olympic sport in the <a href="1940%20Summer%20Olympics">1940 Games</a>. A glider, the <a href="DFS%20Olympia%20Meise">Olympia</a>, was developed in Germany for the event, but World War II intervened. By 1939 the major gliding records were held by Russians, including a distance record of . During the war, the sport of gliding in Europe was largely suspended, though several German <a href="Flying%20ace">fighter aces</a> in the conflict, including <a href="Erich%20Hartmann">Erich Hartmann</a>, began their flight training in gliders. 

Gliding did not return to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a shortage of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20A%C3%A9ronautique%20Internationale">Fédération Aéronautique Internationale</a> (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.

In many countries during the 1950s, a large number of trained pilots wanted to continue flying. Many were also <a href="aeronautical%20engineering">aeronautical engineers</a> who could design, build and maintain gliders. They started both clubs and <a href="List%20of%20gliders">manufacturers</a>, many of which still exist. This stimulated the development of both gliding and gliders, for example the membership of the <a href="Soaring%20Society%20of%20America">Soaring Society of America</a> increased from 1,000 to 16,000 by 1980. The increased numbers of pilots, greater knowledge and improving technology helped set new records, for example the pre-war altitude record was doubled by 1950, and the first flight was achieved in 1964.
New materials such as <a href="glass%20fiber">glass fiber</a> and <a href="carbon%20fiber">carbon fiber</a>, advances in <a href="wing">wing</a> shapes and airfoils, electronic instruments, the <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a> and improved weather forecasting have since allowed many pilots to make flights that were once extraordinary. Today over 550 pilots have made flights over .
Although there is no Olympic competition, there are the <a href="World%20Gliding%20Championships">World Gliding Championships</a>. The first event was held at the Samedan in 1948. Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six <a href="Glider%20Competition%20Classes">classes</a> open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. The latest worldwide statistics for 2011 indicate that Germany, the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounted for 27 percent of the world's glider pilots, and the three major <a href="glider%20manufacturers">glider manufacturers</a> are still based there. However the meteorological conditions that allow soaring are common and the sport has been taken up in many countries. At the last count there were over 111,000 active civilian glider pilots and 32,920 gliders, plus an unknown number of military cadets and aircraft. Clubs actively seek new members by giving trial flights, which are also a useful source of revenue for them.

Glider pilots can stay airborne for hours by flying through air that is ascending as fast or faster than the glider itself is descending, thus gaining <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a>.
The most commonly used sources of rising air are

Ridge lift rarely allows pilots to climb much higher than about above the terrain; thermals, depending on the climate and terrain, can allow climbs in excess of in flat country and much higher above mountains; wave lift has allowed a glider to reach an altitude of .
In a few countries such as the UK, gliders may continue to climb into the clouds in uncontrolled airspace,
but in many European countries the pilot must stop climbing before reaching the cloud base (see <a href="Visual%20Flight%20Rules">Visual Flight Rules</a>).

Thermals begin as bubbles of rising air that are formed on the ground through the warming of the surface by sunlight. If the air contains enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form cumulus clouds.
When the air has little moisture or when an <a href="inversion%20%28meteorology%29">inversion</a> stops the warm air from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or <a href="dust%20devil">dust devil</a>s to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a <a href="variometer">variometer</a> that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals can be found in the exhaust gases from <a href="power%20station">power station</a>s or from fires. 

Once a thermal is encountered, the pilot can fly in tight circles to keep the glider within the thermal, thus gaining altitude before flying toward the destination or to the next thermal. This is known as "thermalling". Alternatively, glider pilots on <a href="Cross-country%20flying">cross-country flights</a> may choose to 'dolphin'. This is when the pilot merely slows down in rising air, and then speeds up again in the non-rising air, thus following an undulating flight path. Dolphining allows the pilot to minimize the loss of height over great distances without spending time turning. Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common and can be maximized by gliders equipped with <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a>. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating <a href="cloud%20street">cloud street</a>s. These can allow the pilot to fly straight while climbing in continuous lift.
As it requires rising heated air, thermalling is most effective in mid-latitudes from spring through late summer. During winter, the sun's heat can only create weak thermals, but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.

A <a href="Ridge%20lift">ridge soaring</a> pilot uses upward air movements caused when the wind blows on to the sides of hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of <a href="Fatigue%20%28physical%29">exhaustion</a>.

The powerfully rising and sinking air in <a href="Lee%20Wave">mountain waves</a> was discovered by glider pilot, <a href="Wolf%20Hirth">Wolf Hirth</a>, in 1933. Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, although pilots must use supplementary <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> to avoid <a href="hypoxia%20%28medical%29">hypoxia</a>.

This lift is often marked by long, stationary <a href="lenticular%20cloud">lenticular</a> (lens-shaped) clouds lying perpendicular to the wind. Wave lift was used to set the current altitude record (to be ratified) of on 2 September 2018 over <a href="El%20Calafate">El Calafate</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. The pilots, <a href="Jim%20Payne%20%28glider%20pilot%29">Jim Payne</a> and <a href="Tim%20Gardner">Tim Gardner</a>, wore pressure suits. The current world distance record of by <a href="Klaus%20Ohlmann">Klaus Ohlmann</a> (set on 21 January 2003) was also flown using mountain waves in South America.

A rare wave phenomenon is known as <a href="Morning%20glory%20cloud">Morning Glory</a>, a <a href="roll%20cloud">roll cloud</a> producing strong lift. Pilots near Australia's <a href="Gulf%20of%20Carpentaria">Gulf of Carpentaria</a> make use of it in <a href="spring%20%28season%29">springtime</a>.

The boundaries where two air masses meet are known as <a href="convergence%20zone">convergence zone</a>s.
These can occur in <a href="sea%20breeze">sea breeze</a>s or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary between two masses of air like a shallow <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a>. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection as if it were a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.

Glider pilots have occasionally been able to use a technique called "<a href="dynamic%20soaring">dynamic soaring</a>" allowing a glider to gain <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> by repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of different horizontal velocity. However, such zones of high "<a href="wind%20gradient">wind gradient</a>" are usually too close to the ground to be used safely by gliders.

Most gliders do not have engines or at least engines that would allow a take-off under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice for the type of launch being used. <a href="Glider%20pilot%20license">Licensing</a> rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.

In an aerotow a powered aircraft is attached to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or <a href="Motor%20glider%23Touring%20motor%20gliders">motor gliders</a> are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the <a href="airframe">airframe</a> of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.

During the aerotow, the glider pilot keeps the glider behind the tow-plane in either the "low tow" position, just below the <a href="Wake%20turbulence">wake</a> from the tow-plane, or the "high tow" position just above the wake. In Australia the convention is to fly in low tow, whereas in the United States and Europe the high tow prevails. One rare aerotow variation is attaching two gliders to one tow-plane, using a short rope for the high-towed glider and a long rope for the low tow. The current record is nine gliders in the same aerotow.

Gliders are often launched using a stationary ground-based <a href="winch">winch</a> mounted on a heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often in addition to an aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by <a href="Liquified%20petroleum%20gas">LPG</a>, petrol or <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel</a>, though <a href="hydraulic%20fluid">hydraulic fluid</a> engines and <a href="electrical%20motor">electrical motor</a>s are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500 ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a <a href="synthetic%20fiber">synthetic fiber</a>, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.

Winch launches are much cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch may also be used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of the shape of the field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than that from an aerotow, so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, or else the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.

Another method of launching, the "autotow", is rarer nowadays. The direct autotow requires a hard surface and a powerful vehicle that is attached to the glider by a long steel cable. After gently taking up slack in the cable, the driver <a href="acceleration">accelerates</a> hard and as a result the glider rises rapidly to about 400 metres (1,300 ft), especially if there is a good <a href="headwind">headwind</a> and a <a href="runway">runway</a> of or more. This method has also been used on desert <a href="dry%20lake">dry lake</a>s.

A variation on the direct autotow is known as the "reverse pulley" method. In this method, the truck drives towards the glider being launched. The cable passes around a pulley at the far end of the airfield, resulting in an effect similar to that of a winch launch.

Bungee launching was widely used in the early days of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a strong breeze using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or "<a href="bungee%20cord">bungee</a>". For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.

A glider can simply be pushed down a slope until gravity can create enough speed for it to take off.

One of the measures of a glider's performance is the distance that it can fly for each meter it descends, known as its <a href="Gliding%20flight%23Glide%20ratio">glide ratio</a>. Glide ratio is dependent on an aircraft's class, and can typically range from 44:1 (for modern designs in the Standard Class) up to 70:1 (for the largest aircraft). A good gliding performance combined with regular sources of rising air enables modern gliders to fly long distances at high speeds. The weather is a major factor in determining cross-country speeds. The record average speed for is and required unusually good conditions, but even in places with less favorable conditions (such as <a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a>) a skilled pilot can expect to complete flights over every year.

As the performance of gliders improved in the 1960s, the concept of flying as far away as possible became unpopular with the crews who had to retrieve the gliders. Pilots now usually plan to fly around a course (called a "task") via <a href="waypoint">turn-points</a>, returning to the starting point.

In addition to just trying to fly further, glider pilots also race each other in <a href="Gliding%20competitions">competitions</a>. The winner is the fastest, or, if the weather conditions are poor, the furthest round the course. Tasks of up to 1,000 km have been set and average speeds of 120 km/h are not unusual.

Initially, ground observers confirmed that pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure <a href="GNSS%20Flight%20Recorders">GNSS Flight Recorders</a> that record the position every few seconds from <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">GPS</a> satellites. These recording devices now provide the proof that the turn-points have been reached.
National competitions generally last one week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed the greatest number of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the <a href="Grand%20Prix%20gliding">Grand Prix</a>, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.

There is a decentralized Internet-based competition called the <a href="Online%20Contest">Online Contest</a>, in which pilots upload their GPS data files and are automatically scored based on distance flown. Worldwide, 6,703 pilots registered for this contest in 2010.

Soaring pioneer <a href="Paul%20MacCready">Paul MacCready</a> is usually credited with developing mathematical principles for optimizing the speed at which to fly when cross-country soaring, although it was first described by <a href="Wolfgang%20Sp%C3%A4te">Wolfgang Späte</a> in 1938. The <a href="speed%20to%20fly">speed to fly</a> theory allows the optimal cruising speed between thermals to be computed, using thermal strength, glider performance and other variables. It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their average speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers, or use a "McCready ring", a rotatable bezel on the glider's variometer to indicate the best speed to fly. The greatest factor in maximizing average speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.

On cross-country flights on days when strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the <a href="center%20of%20gravity">center of gravity</a>, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.

On days with particularly strong and widespread lift pilots can attain high average speeds by alternating periods of fast flight with pull-ups, merely slowing down in areas of lift without deviating from the course. This 'dolphining' technique can result in high average speeds because the height lost can be minimised until particularly strong lift is encountered when circling would be most effective.

Achievements in gliding have been marked by the awarding of <a href="FAI%20gliding%20badges">badges</a> since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the <a href="FAI%20Gliding%20Commission">Gliding Commission</a> of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).

The FAI's Sporting Code defines the rules for observers and recording devices to validate the claims for badges that are defined by kilometers of distance and meters of altitude gained.
The Silver-C badge was introduced in 1930. Earning the Silver Badge shows that a glider pilot has achieved an altitude gain of at least , made a five-hour duration flight, and has flown cross-country for a straight-line distance of at least : these three attainments are usually, but not invariably, achieved in separate flights. The Gold and Diamond Badges require pilots to fly higher and further. A pilot who has completed the three parts of the Diamond Badge has flown to a pre-defined goal, has flown in one flight (but not necessarily to a pre-defined goal) and gained in height. The FAI also issues a diploma for a flight of and further diplomas for increments of .

If lift is not found during a cross-country flight, for example because of deteriorating weather, the pilot must choose a location to "land out". Although inconvenient and often mistaken for "<a href="emergency%20landing">emergency landing</a>s", landing out (or "outlanding") is a routine event in cross-country gliding. The pilot has to choose a location where the glider can be landed safely, without damaging the plane, the pilot, or property such as crops or livestock. The glider and the pilot(s) can then be retrieved by road from the outlanding location using a purpose-built trailer. In some instances, a tow-plane can be summoned to re-launch the aircraft.

Although adding to the weight and expense, some gliders are fitted with small power units and are known as <a href="motor%20glider">motor glider</a>s. This avoids the inconvenience of landing out. The power units can be <a href="internal%20combustion">internal combustion</a> engines, electrical motors, or retractable <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a>s. Retractable propellers are fitted to high performance sailplanes, though in another category, called <a href="Motor%20glider%23Fixed%20or%20feathering%20propeller">touring motor gliders</a>, non-retractable propellers are used. Some powered gliders are "self launching", which makes the glider independent of a tow plane. However some gliders have "sustainer" engines that can prolong flight but are not powerful enough for launching. All power units have to be started at a height that includes a margin that would still allow a safe landing out to be made, if there were a failure to start.

In a competition, using the engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, as they do not need a safety margin for starting the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.

<a href="World%20Gliding%20Championships%23FAI%20World%20Glider%20Aerobatic%20Championships">World</a> and <a href="European%20Gliding%20Championships">European</a> <a href="Aerobatic">Aerobatic</a> competitions are held regularly. In this type of <a href="competition%20aerobatics">competition</a>, the pilots fly a program of <a href="aerobatic%20maneuver">maneuvers</a> (such as inverted flight, loop, roll, and various combinations). Each maneuver has a rating called the "K-Factor". Maximum points are given for the maneuver if it is flown perfectly; otherwise, points are deducted. Efficient maneuvers also enable the whole program to be completed with the height available. The winner is the pilot with the most points.

Unlike <a href="hang%20gliders">hang gliders</a> and <a href="paragliding">paragliders</a>, gliders surround the pilots with strong structures and have undercarriages to absorb impacts when landing. These features prevent injuries from otherwise minor incidents,

In addition to national laws controlling aviation, the sport in many countries is regulated through national gliding associations and then through local gliding clubs. Much of the regulation concerns safety and training.

Many clubs provide training for new pilots. The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically from the back seat, but otherwise the student manages the controls until the student is deemed to have the skill and the <a href="airmanship">airmanship</a> necessary to fly solo. <a href="Flight%20simulator">Simulators</a> are also beginning to be used in training, especially during poor weather.

After the first solo flights glider pilots are required to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.

In addition to the regulation of pilots, gliders are inspected annually and after exceeding predetermined flight times. Maximum and minimum <a href="payload%20%28air%20and%20space%20craft%29">payload</a>s are also defined for each glider. Because most gliders are designed to the same specifications of safety, the upper weight limit for a pilot, after allowing for a parachute, is usually . There is also a limit, 193 centimetres (6 ft 4 in), on the tallest pilots who can safely fit into a typical glider's cockpit.

According to the FAI President, gliding as a sport faces challenges in the years ahead. These include:

The two air sports that are most closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are significant differences which are listed in detail in . The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. <a href="Radio-controlled%20glider">Radio-controlled gliding</a> uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.

Nigersaurus

Nigersaurus is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="rebbachisauridae">rebbachisaurid</a> <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> dinosaur that lived during the middle <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period, about 115 to 105 million years ago. It was discovered in the <a href="Elrhaz%20Formation">Elrhaz Formation</a> in an area called <a href="Gadoufaoua">Gadoufaoua</a>, in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Niger">Republic of Niger</a>. Fossils of this dinosaur were first described in 1976, but it was only named Nigersaurus taqueti in 1999, after further and more complete remains were found and described. The genus name means "Niger reptile", and the specific name honours the French palaeontologist <a href="Philippe%20Taquet">Philippe Taquet</a>, who discovered the first remains.

Small for a sauropod, "Nigersaurus" was about long, and had a short neck. It weighed around four tonnes, comparable to a modern <a href="elephant">elephant</a>. Its skeleton was highly <a href="Skeletal%20pneumaticity">pneumatised</a> (filled with air spaces connected to <a href="Physiology%20of%20dinosaurs%23Air%20sacs">air sacs</a>), but the limbs were robustly built. Its skull was very specialised for feeding, with large <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestrae</a> and thin bones. It had a wide muzzle filled with more than 500 teeth, which were replaced at a rapid rate: around every 14 days. The jaws may have borne a <a href="keratinous">keratinous</a> sheath. Unlike other <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s, the tooth-bearing bones of its jaws were rotated transversely relative to the rest of the skull, so that all of its teeth were located far to the front.

"Nigersaurus" and its closest relatives are grouped within the subfamily <a href="Rebbachisaurinae">Rebbachisaurinae</a> (formerly thought to be grouped in the <a href="eponymous">eponymous</a> Nigersaurinae) of the family Rebbachisauridae, which is part of the sauropod superfamily <a href="Diplodocoidea">Diplodocoidea</a>. "Nigersaurus" was probably a browser, and fed with its head close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected smell was underdeveloped, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a <a href="riparian">riparian</a> habitat, and its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="horsetails">horsetails</a>, and <a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a>. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other dinosaurian <a href="megaherbivore">megaherbivore</a>s, as well as large <a href="theropods">theropods</a> and <a href="crocodylomorph">crocodylomorph</a>s.

Like all <a href="sauropods">sauropods</a>, "Nigersaurus" was a <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a>l <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a> with a small head, thick hind legs, and a prominent tail. Among that <a href="clade">clade</a>, "Nigersaurus" was fairly small, with a body length of only and a <a href="femur">femur</a> reaching only . It may have weighed around four tonnes, comparable to a modern <a href="elephant">elephant</a>. It had a short neck for a sauropod, with thirteen <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a>. Nearly all <a href="rebbachisauridae">rebbachisaurid</a>s had relatively short necks and a length of or less. The only member of the family that reached the size of larger sauropods was "<a href="Rebbachisaurus">Rebbachisaurus</a>".

The presacral vertebrae (vertebrae before the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>) were heavily <a href="Skeletal%20pneumaticity">pneumatised</a> to the point where the column consisted of a series of hollow "shells", each divided by a thin <a href="septum">septum</a> in the middle. It had little to no <a href="cancellous%20bone">cancellous bone</a>, making the <a href="Vertebral%20column%23Classification">centra</a> thin bone plates filled with air spaces. The <a href="vertebral%20arch">vertebral arch</a>es were so heavily pierced by extensions of the external <a href="air%20sacs">air sacs</a> that of their side walls little remained but thick intersecting <a href="Lamina%20of%20the%20vertebral%20arch">laminae</a>, the ridges between the pneumatic openings. The vertebrae of the tail, however, did have solid centra. The <a href="pelvic">pelvic</a> and <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a> bones were very thin also, often only several millimetres thick. Like other sauropods, its limbs were robust, contrasting with the extremely lightweight construction of the rest of the skeleton. The limbs were not as specialised as the rest of the skeleton, and the front legs of "Nigersaurus" were about two-thirds the length of the back legs, as in most <a href="diplodocoid">diplodocoid</a>s.

The skull of "Nigersaurus" was delicate, with the four side <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestra</a>e (openings in the skull) larger than in other <a href="sauropodomorph">sauropodomorph</a>s. The total area of bone connecting the muzzle to the back of the skull was only . These connecting struts of bones were usually less than thick. Despite this, the skull was resistant to the sustained shearing of the teeth. Another unique trait it had among sauropodomorphs was a closed <a href="Skull%23Temporal%20fenestrae">supratemporal fenestra</a>. The nasal openings, the bony nostrils, were elongated. Though the nasal bones are not completely known, it appears the front margin of the bony nostril was closer to the snout than in other diplodocoids. The snout was also proportionately shorter, and the tooth row was not at all <a href="prognathous">prognathous</a>, the snout tip not protruding relative to the remainder of the tooth series. The maxillary tooth row was in its entirety transversely rotated, its normal rear 90° everted towards the front. This was matched by an identical rotation of the dentary of the lower jaw. As a result, no other tetrapod had all of its teeth located as far to the front as "Nigersaurus".

The slender teeth had slightly curved crowns, which were oval in cross-section. The teeth in the lower jaw may have been 20–30% smaller than those in the upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical. Under each active tooth there was a column of nine replacement teeth within the jaw. With 68 columns in the upper jaws and 60 columns in the lower jaws, these so-called dental batteries (also present in <a href="hadrosaur">hadrosaur</a>s and <a href="ceratopsian">ceratopsian</a>s) comprised a total of more than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually. The <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> on the teeth of "Nigersaurus" was highly asymmetrical, ten times thicker on the outwards facing side than on the inner side. This condition is otherwise known only in advanced <a href="ornithischians">ornithischians</a>.

"Nigersaurus" did not exhibit the same modifications seen in the jaws of other dinosaurs with dental batteries, or mammals with elaborate chewing functions. The <a href="lower%20jaw">lower jaw</a> was S-shaped and divided into the <a href="subcylindrical">subcylindrical</a> <a href="Transverse%20plane">transverse</a> <a href="Ramus%20of%20the%20mandible">ramus</a>, which contained the teeth, and the back ramus, which was more lightweight and was the location for most of the muscle attachments. The jaws also contained several fenestrae, including three that are not present in other sauropods. The front ends of the jaws had grooves that indicate the presence of a <a href="keratinous">keratinous</a> (horny) sheath. "Nigersaurus" is the only known tetrapod animal to have had jaws wider than the skull and teeth that extended laterally across the front. The snout was even broader than those of the "duck-billed" <a href="hadrosaurs">hadrosaurs</a>.

Remains thought to belong to "Nigersaurus" were first discovered during a 1965–72 expedition to the <a href="Republic%20of%20Niger">Republic of Niger</a> led by French paleontologist <a href="Philippe%20Taquet">Philippe Taquet</a>, and first mentioned in a paper published in 1976. Although a common genus, the dinosaur had been poorly known until more material of other individuals was discovered during expeditions led by American palaeontologist <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a> in 1997 and 2000. The limited understanding of the genus was the result of poor preservation of its remains, which arises from the delicate and highly pneumatic construction of the skull and skeleton, in turn causing disarticulation of the fossils. Some of the skull fossils were so thin that a strong light beam was visible through them. Therefore, no intact skulls or articulated skeletons have been found, and these specimens represent the most complete known rebbachisaurid remains.

"Nigersaurus" was named and described in more detail by Sereno and colleagues only in 1999, based on remains of newly found individuals. The same article also named "<a href="Jobaria">Jobaria</a>", another sauropod from Niger. The genus name "Nigersaurus" ("Niger reptile") is a reference to the country where it was discovered, and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "taqueti" honours Taquet, who was the first to organise large-scale palaeontological expeditions to Niger. The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen (MNN GAD512) consists of a partial skull and neck. Limb material and a <a href="scapula">scapula</a> found nearby were also referred to the same specimen. These fossils are housed at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Niger">National Museum of Niger</a>.

Sereno and the American palaeontologist <a href="Jeffrey%20A.%20Wilson">Jeffrey A. Wilson</a> provided the first detailed description of the skull and feeding adaptations in 2005. In 2007, a more detailed description of the skeleton was published, based on a specimen discovered ten years earlier. The fossils, along with a reconstructed skeleton mount and a plastic model of the head and neck, were subsequently presented at the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a> in Washington. "Nigersaurus" was dubbed a "<a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> cow" in the press, and Sereno stressed that it was the most unusual dinosaur he had ever seen. He likened its physical appearance to <a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a> and a <a href="vacuum%20cleaner">vacuum cleaner</a>, and compared its tooth shear with a <a href="conveyor%20belt">conveyor belt</a> and sharpened piano keys.

Teeth similar to those of "Nigersaurus" have been found on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> and in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, but it is unknown whether they belonged to relatives of this <a href="taxon">taxon</a>, or to <a href="titanosaurs">titanosaurs</a>, whose remains have been found in the vicinity. A lower jaw assigned to the titanosaur "<a href="Antarctosaurus">Antarctosaurus</a>" is likewise similar to that of "Nigersaurus", but may have <a href="convergent%20evolution">evolved convergently</a>.

The remains of "Nigersaurus" were initially described in 1976 as belonging to a <a href="dicraeosaurid">dicraeosaurid</a>, but in 1999 Sereno's team reclassified it as a rebbachisaurid diplodocoid. Rebbachisauridae is the <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basalmost</a> family within the superfamily Diplodocoidea, which also contains the long-necked <a href="diplodocid">diplodocid</a>s and the short-necked dicraeosaurids. The <a href="eponymous">eponymous</a> subfamily <a href="Nigersaurinae">Nigersaurinae</a>, which includes "Nigersaurus" and closely related genera, was named by the American palaeontologist John A. Whitlock in 2011. Below is a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> following a 2013 analysis by the Italian palaeontologist Federico Fanti and colleagues, which confirmed the placement of "Nigersaurus" as a basal nigersaurine rebbachisaurid.

The closely related genus "<a href="Demandasaurus">Demandasaurus</a>" from Spain was described in 2003, and along with other animal groups that span the Cretaceous of Africa and Europe, this indicates that <a href="carbonate%20platforms">carbonate platforms</a> connected these landmasses across the <a href="Tethys%20Sea">Tethys Sea</a>. This was supported in 2013 by the description of the nigersaurine "<a href="Tataouinea">Tataouinea</a>" from Tunisia, which was more related to the European form than to "Nigersaurus", despite being from Africa, then part of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. The discovery of these basal diplodocoids may indicate that short necks and small size were ancestral features of the group. Pneumatisation of the rebbachisaurid skeleton evolved progressively, culminating in the nigersaurines. A 2015 cladistic study found "Rebbachisaurus" itself to group with the nigersaurines, and the authors suggested that Nigersaurinae was therefore a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of Rebbachisaurinae. "Nigersaurus" was the basalmost member of this "Euro-African" subclade.

Though it had large nostrils and a fleshy snout, Sereno and colleagues found that "Nigersaurus" had an underdeveloped olfactory region of its brain and thus did not have an advanced sense of smell. Its <a href="Brain-to-body%20mass%20ratio">brain-to-body-mass ratio</a> was average for a reptile, and smaller than those of ornithischians and non-<a href="coelurosaurian">coelurosaurian</a> <a href="theropod">theropod</a>s. The <a href="cerebrum">cerebrum</a> comprised about 30% of the brain volume, as in many other dinosaurs.

In 2017, the Argentinian palaeontologist Lucio M. Ibiricu and colleagues examined the postcranial skeletal pneumacity in the skeletons of rebbachisaurids, and suggested that it was an adapttion for lowering the density of the skeleton, and that this could have decreased the muscle energy needed to move the body, as well as the heat generated in the process. Since several rebbachisaurids inhabited latitudes that would have been tropical to subtropical in the Middle Cretaceous, this pneumacity may have helped the animals cope with the very high temperatures. According to Ibiricu and colleagues, this adaptation may be a reason why rebbachisaurids were the only group of diplodocoids that survived into the Late Cretaceous.

"Nigersaurus" was suggested by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective <a href="browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a>. The width of the muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by <a href="Attrition%20%28dental%29">facet</a>s on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to "<a href="Dicraeosaurus">Dicraeosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>", which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. "Nigersaurus" also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear on the inside of the <a href="Maxillary%20central%20incisor">maxillary</a> <a href="Crown%20%28dentistry%29">crown</a>s, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground does not necessarily mean they browsed on items there, and the short neck of "Nigersaurus" would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.

The <a href="Adduction">adductor</a> muscle of the jaw appears to have attached to the <a href="Quadrate%20bone">quadrate</a> instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other <a href="Muscles%20of%20mastication">mastication muscles</a> were likely weak, and "Nigersaurus" is estimated to have had one of the weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, <a href="herbaceous">herbaceous</a> plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it probably would not have been able to chew. "Nigersaurus" wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to "Nigersaurus", sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> browsers.

On the basis of <a href="microtomography">microtomography</a> scans of skull elements of the holotype specimen, Sereno and colleagues created a "<a href="prototype">prototype</a>" "Nigersaurus" skull they could examine. They also made an <a href="endocast">endocast</a> of the brain and scanned the <a href="semicircular%20canals">semicircular canals</a> of its <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a>, which they found to be oriented horizontally. In their 2007 study, they stated that the structure of the <a href="occiput">occiput</a> and cervical vertebrae would have limited the upward and downward movement of the neck and the rotation of the skull. Based on this biomechanical analysis, the team concluded that the head and muzzle were habitually oriented 67° downwards and close to ground level, as an adaptation for ground-level browsing. This is unlike the way other sauropods have been restored, with their heads held more horizontally.

A 2009 study by the palaeontologists <a href="Mike%20P.%20Taylor">Mike P. Taylor</a>, Mathew Wedel, and <a href="Darren%20Naish">Darren Naish</a> agreed that "Nigersaurus" was able to feed with the downturned head and neck posture proposed by the 2007 study, but contested that this was the habitual posture of the animal. The study noted that the "neutral" head and neck posture of modern animals does not necessarily correspond to their habitual head posture. It further argued that the orientation of the semicircular canals varies significantly within modern species, and is therefore not reliable for determining head posture. This was supported by the Spanish palaeontologist Jesús Marugán-Lobón and colleagues in a 2013 study that suggested the methods used by Sereno's team were imprecise, and that "Nigersaurus" habitually held its head like other sauropods.

"Nigersaurus" is known from the <a href="Elrhaz%20Formation">Elrhaz Formation</a> of the <a href="Tegama%20Group">Tegama Group</a> in an area called <a href="Gadoufaoua">Gadoufaoua</a>, located in Niger. It is one of the most commonly found vertebrates in the formation. The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The <a href="sediments">sediments</a> are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained <a href="Horizon%20%28geology%29">horizons</a>. "Nigersaurus" lived in what is now Niger about 115 to 105 million years ago, during the <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> and <a href="Albian">Albian</a> ages of the mid-Cretaceous. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s (a <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a>).

After the <a href="iguanodontian">iguanodontian</a> "<a href="Lurdusaurus">Lurdusaurus</a>", "Nigersaurus" was the most numerous <a href="megaherbivore">megaherbivore</a>. Other herbivores from the same formation include "<a href="Ouranosaurus">Ouranosaurus</a>", "<a href="Elrhazosaurus">Elrhazosaurus</a>", and an unnamed <a href="titanosaur">titanosaur</a>. It also lived alongside the <a href="theropods">theropods</a> "<a href="Kryptops">Kryptops</a>", "<a href="Suchomimus">Suchomimus</a>", and "<a href="Eocarcharia">Eocarcharia</a>", and a yet-unnamed <a href="noasaurid">noasaurid</a>. <a href="Crocodylomorphs">Crocodylomorphs</a> like "<a href="Sarcosuchus">Sarcosuchus</a>", "<a href="Anatosuchus">Anatosuchus</a>", "<a href="Araripesuchus">Araripesuchus</a>", and "<a href="Stolokrosuchus">Stolokrosuchus</a>" also lived there. In addition, remains of a <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>, <a href="chelonians">chelonians</a>, fish, a <a href="hybodont">hybodont</a> shark, and freshwater bivalves have been found. Grass did not evolve until the late Cretaceous, making <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="horsetails">horsetails</a>, and <a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a> (which had evolved by the middle Cretaceous) potential food for "Nigersaurus". It is unlikely the dinosaur fed on <a href="conifers">conifers</a>, <a href="cycads">cycads</a>, or <a href="Aquatic%20plant">aquatic vegetation</a>, due respectively to their height, hard and stiff structure, and lack of appropriate habitat.

Nelson Mandela

Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (; ; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African <a href="Internal%20resistance%20to%20South%20African%20apartheid">anti-apartheid</a> revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as <a href="President%20of%20South%20Africa">President of South Africa</a> from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a <a href="Universal%20suffrage">fully representative</a> democratic election. <a href="Presidency%20of%20Nelson%20Mandela">His government</a> focused on dismantling the legacy of <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial <a href="Conflict%20resolution">reconciliation</a>. Ideologically an <a href="African%20nationalism">African nationalist</a> and <a href="Socialism">socialist</a>, he served as President of the <a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a> (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
A <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a>, Mandela was born to the <a href="Thembu">Thembu</a> royal family in <a href="Mvezo">Mvezo</a>, <a href="British%20South%20Africa">British South Africa</a>. He studied law at the <a href="University%20of%20Fort%20Hare">University of Fort Hare</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Witwatersrand">University of Witwatersrand</a> before working as a lawyer in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>. There he became involved in <a href="anti-colonial">anti-colonial</a> and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its <a href="African%20National%20Congress%20Youth%20League">Youth League</a> in 1944. After the <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">National Party</a>'s <a href="Dominant%20minority">white-only government</a> established apartheid, a system of <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> that privileged <a href="White%20South%20African">whites</a>, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's <a href="Transvaal%20Province">Transvaal</a> branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 <a href="Defiance%20Campaign">Defiance Campaign</a> and the 1955 <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20People%20%281955%29">Congress of the People</a>. He was repeatedly arrested for <a href="seditious">seditious</a> activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the <a href="1956%20Treason%20Trial">1956 Treason Trial</a>. Influenced by <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, he secretly joined the banned <a href="South%20African%20Communist%20Party">South African Communist Party</a> (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant <a href="Umkhonto%20we%20Sizwe">Umkhonto we Sizwe</a> in 1961 and led a <a href="sabotage">sabotage</a> campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the <a href="Rivonia%20Trial">Rivonia Trial</a>.
Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between <a href="Robben%20Island">Robben Island</a>, <a href="Pollsmoor%20Prison">Pollsmoor Prison</a>, and <a href="Victor%20Verster%20Prison">Victor Verster Prison</a>. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President <a href="F.%20W.%20de%20Klerk">F. W. de Klerk</a> released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the <a href="South%20African%20general%20election%2C%201994">1994 multiracial general election</a> in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a <a href="Government%20of%20National%20Unity%20%28South%20Africa%29">broad coalition government</a> which promulgated a <a href="Constitution%20of%20South%20Africa">new constitution</a>, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the <a href="Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28South%20Africa%29">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> to investigate past <a href="Human%20rights%20in%20South%20Africa">human rights</a> abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's <a href="economic%20liberalism">liberal framework</a> despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a>, <a href="poverty%20reduction">combat poverty</a>, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the <a href="Pan%20Am%20Flight%20103%20bombing%20trial">Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial</a> and served as Secretary-General of the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a> from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term, and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, <a href="Thabo%20Mbeki">Thabo Mbeki</a>. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> through the charitable <a href="Nelson%20Mandela%20Foundation">Nelson Mandela Foundation</a>.
Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the <a href="right-wing%20politics">right</a> denounced him as a <a href="communist%20terrorist">communist terrorist</a> and those on the <a href="Far%20left%20politics">far-left</a> deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>, he received <a href="List%20of%20Nelson%20Mandela%20awards%20and%20honours">more than 250 honours</a>—including the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>—and became the subject of a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a>. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his <a href="Xhosa%20clan%20names">Xhosa clan name</a>, Madiba, and described as the "<a href="Father%20of%20the%20Nation">Father of the Nation</a>".

Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in <a href="Mthatha">Umtata</a>, then part of South Africa's <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a>. Given the forename Rolihlahla, a <a href="Xhosa%20language">Xhosa</a> term colloquially meaning "troublemaker", in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba. His patrilineal great-grandfather, <a href="Ngubengcuka">Ngubengcuka</a>, was king of the <a href="Thembu">Thembu</a> people in the <a href="Transkei">Transkei</a>an Territories of South Africa's modern <a href="Eastern%20Cape">Eastern Cape</a> province. One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname. Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his <a href="cadet%20branch">cadet branch</a> of the royal family were <a href="morganatic%20marriage">morganatic</a>, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.

Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880–1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god <a href="Qamata">Qamata</a>, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.

Mandela later stated that his early life was dominated by traditional Thembu custom and taboo. He grew up with two sisters in his mother's "<a href="homestead%20%28small%20African%20settlement%29">kraal</a>" in the village of <a href="Qunu">Qunu</a>, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys. Both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout Christian, his mother sent him to a local <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> school when he was about seven. Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the English forename of "Nelson" by his teacher. When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease. Feeling "cut adrift", he later said that he inherited his father's "proud rebelliousness" and "stubborn sense of fairness".

Mandela's mother took him to the "Great Place" palace at Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the Thembu <a href="Regency%20%28government%29">regent</a>, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Although he did not see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated him as their own child, raising him alongside their son, Justice, and daughter, Nomafu. As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his life. He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace, where he studied English, Xhosa, history and geography. He developed a love of <a href="African%20history">African history</a>, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by the <a href="anti-imperialist">anti-imperialist</a> rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi. At the time he nevertheless considered the <a href="Scramble%20for%20Africa">European colonialists</a> not as oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to southern Africa. Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the <a href="ulwaluko">ulwaluko</a> <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the name "Dalibunga".

Intending to gain skills needed to become a <a href="privy%20council">privy council</a>lor for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at <a href="Clarkebury">Clarkebury</a> Methodist High School in <a href="Engcobo">Engcobo</a>, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in <a href="Thembuland">Thembuland</a>. Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening. He completed his Junior Certificate in two years, and in 1937 moved to <a href="Healdtown%20Comprehensive%20School">Healdtown</a>, the Methodist college in <a href="Fort%20Beaufort">Fort Beaufort</a> attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice. The headmaster emphasised the superiority of <a href="English%20culture">English culture</a> and <a href="Westminster%20system">government</a>, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native <a href="African%20culture">African culture</a>, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of <a href="Sotho%20language">Sotho</a>, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho. Mandela spent much of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a <a href="prefect">prefect</a>.

With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela began work on a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">BA degree</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Fort%20Hare">University of Fort Hare</a>, an elite black institution in <a href="Alice%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Alice, Eastern Cape</a>, with around 150 students. There he studied English, <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>, politics, native administration, and <a href="Roman%20Dutch%20law">Roman Dutch law</a> in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the <a href="INTAF">Native Affairs Department</a>. Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, <a href="Kaiser%20Matanzima">K. D. Matanzima</a>, as well as <a href="Oliver%20Tambo">Oliver Tambo</a>, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society play about <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, and gave <a href="Bible">Bible</a> classes in the local community as part of the Student Christian Association. Although he had friends connected to the <a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a> (ANC) who wanted South Africa to be independent of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, Mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist movement, and became a vocal supporter of the <a href="British%20Empire%20in%20World%20War%20II">British war effort</a> when the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> broke out. He helped to found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, and at the end of his first year became involved in a <a href="Students%27%20Representative%20Council">Students' Representative Council</a> (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.

Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had <a href="arranged%20marriage">arranged marriage</a>s for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> via <a href="Queenstown%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Queenstown</a>, arriving in April 1941. Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the "induna" (headman) discovered that he was a runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist <a href="Walter%20Sisulu">Walter Sisulu</a>. The latter secured Mandela a job as an <a href="articled%20clerk">articled clerk</a> at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a <a href="Liberalism">liberal</a> Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause. At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Xhosa member of the ANC and <a href="South%20African%20Communist%20Party">Communist Party</a>—and Nat Bregman, a Jewish <a href="communism">communist</a> who became his first white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party gatherings, where he was impressed that <a href="White%20South%20Africans">Europeans</a>, <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Africans</a>, <a href="Asian%20South%20Africans">Indians</a>, and <a href="Coloured">Coloured</a>s mixed as equals. He later stated that he did not join the Party because its <a href="atheism">atheism</a> conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than as <a href="class%20conflict">class warfare</a>. To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a <a href="University%20of%20South%20Africa">University of South Africa</a> correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night.

Earning a small wage, Mandela rented a room in the house of the Xhoma family in the <a href="Alexandra%2C%20Gauteng">Alexandra</a> township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always remained a special place for him. Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a <a href="Swazi%20people">Swazi</a> woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the <a href="Witwatersrand%20Native%20Labour%20Association">Witwatersrand Native Labour Association</a>, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the <a href="Regent">Queen Regent</a> of <a href="Basutoland">Basutoland</a>. In late 1941, Jongintaba visited Johannesburg—there forgiving Mandela for running away—before returning to Thembuland, where he died in the winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland. He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he "simply found [himself] doing so, and could not do otherwise."

Mandela began studying law at the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Witwatersrand">University of the Witwatersrand</a>, where he was the only black African student and faced racism. There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them <a href="Joe%20Slovo">Joe Slovo</a> and <a href="Ruth%20First">Ruth First</a>. Becoming increasingly politicised, in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises. Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's <a href="Orlando%2C%20Soweto">Orlando</a> house, including his old friend Oliver Tambo. In 1943, Mandela met <a href="Anton%20Lembede">Anton Lembede</a>, an ANC member affiliated with the "Africanist" branch of <a href="African%20nationalism">African nationalism</a>, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists. Despite his friendships with non-blacks and communists, Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self-determination. Deciding on the need for a youth wing to mass-mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjugation, Mandela was among a delegation that approached ANC President <a href="Alfred%20Bitini%20Xuma">Alfred Bitini Xuma</a> on the subject at his home in <a href="Sophiatown">Sophiatown</a>; the <a href="African%20National%20Congress%20Youth%20League">African National Congress Youth League</a> (ANCYL) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the <a href="Bantu%20Men%27s%20Social%20Centre">Bantu Men's Social Centre</a>, with Lembede as President and Mandela as a member of its executive committee.

At Sisulu's house, Mandela met <a href="Evelyn%20Mase">Evelyn Mase</a>, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from <a href="Engcobo">Engcobo</a>, <a href="Transkei">Transkei</a>. Entering a relationship and marrying in October 1944, they initially lived with her relatives until moving into a rented house in the township of <a href="Orlando%2C%20Soweto">Orlando</a> in early 1946. Their first child, Madiba "Thembi" Thembekile, was born in February 1945; a daughter, Makaziwe, was born in 1947 but died of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> nine months later. Mandela enjoyed home life, welcoming his mother and his sister, Leabie, to stay with him. In early 1947, his three years of articles ended at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, and he decided to become a full-time student, subsisting on loans from the Bantu Welfare Trust.

In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, where he died; he was succeeded as ANCYL president by the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. Mandela disagreed with Mda's approach, and in December 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL, considering their ideology un-African. In 1947, Mandela was elected to the executive committee of the ANC's <a href="Transvaal%20Province">Transvaal Province</a> branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. When Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela was one of those who forced his resignation.

In the <a href="South%20African%20general%20election%2C%201948">South African general election in 1948</a>, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated <a href="Herenigde%20Nasionale%20Party">Herenigde Nasionale Party</a> under <a href="Daniel%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Malan">Daniel François Malan</a> took power, soon uniting with the <a href="Afrikaner%20Party">Afrikaner Party</a> to form the <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">National Party</a>. Openly <a href="Racialism%20%28Racial%20categorization%29">racialist</a>, the party codified and expanded racial segregation with new <a href="apartheid%20legislation">apartheid legislation</a>. Gaining increasing influence in the ANC, Mandela and his party cadre allies began advocating <a href="direct%20action">direct action</a> against apartheid, such as boycotts and strikes, influenced by the tactics already employed by South Africa's Indian community. Xuma did not support these measures and was removed from the presidency in a <a href="Motion%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a>, replaced by <a href="James%20Moroka">James Moroka</a> and a more militant executive committee containing Sisulu, Mda, Tambo, and Godfrey Pitje. Mandela later related that he and his colleagues had "guided the ANC to a more radical and revolutionary path." Having devoted his time to politics, Mandela failed his final year at Witwatersrand three times; he was ultimately denied his degree in December 1949.

Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950, and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL. In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian, and communist activists to call a <a href="International%20Workers%27%20Day">May Day</a> <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> in protest against apartheid and white minority rule. Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the <a href="Suppression%20of%20Communism%20Act%2C%201950">Suppression of Communism Act, 1950</a>, affecting the actions of all protest groups. At the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.

Thereafter, Mandela rejected Lembede's Africanism and embraced the idea of a multi-racial front against apartheid. Influenced by friends like <a href="Moses%20Kotane">Moses Kotane</a> and by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s support for <a href="wars%20of%20national%20liberation">wars of national liberation</a>, his mistrust of communism broke down and he began reading literature by <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, and <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>, eventually embracing the <a href="Marxist%20philosophy">Marxist philosophy</a> of <a href="dialectical%20materialism">dialectical materialism</a>. Commenting on communism, he later stated that he "found [himself] strongly drawn to the idea of a classless society which, to [his] mind, was similar to traditional African culture where life was shared and communal." In April 1952, Mandela began work at the H.M. Basner law firm, which was owned by a communist, although his increasing commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with his family.

In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint <a href="Defiance%20Campaign">Defiance Campaign</a> against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers. The campaign was designed to follow the path of <a href="nonviolent%20resistance">nonviolent resistance</a> influenced by <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>; some supported this for ethical reasons, but Mandela instead considered it pragmatic. At a <a href="Durban">Durban</a> rally on 22 June, Mandela addressed an assembled crowd of 10,000, initiating the campaign protests, for which he was arrested and briefly interned in Marshall Square prison. These events established Mandela as one of the best-known black political figures in South Africa. With further protests, the ANC's membership grew from 20,000 to 100,000; the government responded with mass arrests and introduced the <a href="Public%20Safety%20Act%2C%201953">Public Safety Act, 1953</a> to permit <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>. In May, authorities banned Transvaal ANC President <a href="J.%20B.%20Marks">J. B. Marks</a> from making public appearances; unable to maintain his position, he recommended Mandela as his successor. Although Africanists opposed his candidacy, Mandela was elected regional president in October.

In July 1952, Mandela was arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act and stood trial as one of the 21 accused—among them Moroka, Sisulu, and <a href="Yusuf%20Dadoo">Yusuf Dadoo</a>—in Johannesburg. Found guilty of "statutory communism", a term that the government used to describe most opposition to apartheid, their sentence of nine months' <a href="hard%20labour">hard labour</a> was <a href="Suspended%20sentence">suspended</a> for two years. In December, Mandela was given a six-month ban from attending meetings or talking to more than one individual at a time, making his Transvaal ANC presidency impractical, and during this period the Defiance Campaign petered out. In September 1953, Andrew Kunene read out Mandela's "No Easy Walk to Freedom" speech at a Transvaal ANC meeting; the title was taken from a quote by Indian independence leader <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, a seminal influence on Mandela's thought. The speech laid out a contingency plan for a scenario in which the ANC was banned. This Mandela Plan, or M-Plan, involved dividing the organisation into a <a href="Clandestine%20cell%20system">cell structure</a> with a more centralised leadership.

Mandela obtained work as an attorney for the firm Terblanche and Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm, <a href="Mandela%20and%20Tambo">Mandela and Tambo</a>, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of <a href="police%20brutality">police brutality</a>. Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the <a href="Group%20Areas%20Act">Group Areas Act</a>; as a result, their clientele dwindled. As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, Mandela was part of Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much respect from the black community. Although a second daughter, <a href="Makaziwe%20Mandela">Makaziwe Phumia</a>, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. He may have had affairs with ANC member <a href="Lillian%20Ngoyi">Lillian Ngoyi</a> and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child. Disgusted by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to Transkei, while Evelyn embraced the <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> and rejected Mandela's preoccupation with politics.

After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. On his advice, Sisulu requested weaponry from the People's Republic of China, which was denied. Although the Chinese government supported the anti-apartheid struggle, they believed the movement insufficiently prepared for <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>. With the involvement of the <a href="South%20African%20Indian%20Congress">South African Indian Congress</a>, the Coloured People's Congress, the <a href="South%20African%20Congress%20of%20Trade%20Unions">South African Congress of Trade Unions</a> and the <a href="South%20African%20Congress%20of%20Democrats">Congress of Democrats</a>, the ANC planned a <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20People%20%281955%29">Congress of the People</a>, calling on all South Africans to send in proposals for a post-apartheid era. Based on the responses, a <a href="Freedom%20Charter">Freedom Charter</a> was drafted by <a href="Rusty%20Bernstein">Rusty Bernstein</a>, calling for the creation of a democratic, non-racialist state with the <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> of major industry. The charter was adopted at a June 1955 conference in <a href="Kliptown">Kliptown</a>; 3,000 delegates attended the event, which was forcibly closed down by police. The tenets of the Freedom Charter remained important for Mandela, and in 1956 he described it as "an inspiration to the people of South Africa".

Following the end of a second ban in September 1955, Mandela went on a working holiday to <a href="Transkei">Transkei</a> to discuss the implications of the <a href="Bantu%20Authorities%20Act%2C%201951">Bantu Authorities Act, 1951</a> with local tribal leaders, also visiting his mother and Noengland before proceeding to <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>. In March 1956 he received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it. Mandela's marriage broke down and Evelyn left him, taking their children to live with her brother. Initiating divorce proceedings in May 1956, she claimed that Mandela had physically abused her; he denied the allegations, and fought for custody of their children. She withdrew her petition of separation in November, but Mandela filed for divorce in January 1958; the divorce was finalised in March, with the children placed in Evelyn's care. During the divorce proceedings, he began courting a social worker, <a href="Winnie%20Madikizela-Mandela">Winnie Madikizela</a>, whom he married in <a href="Bizana%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Bizana</a> in June 1958. She later became involved in ANC activities, spending several weeks in prison. Together they had two children: <a href="Zenani%20Mandela-Dlamini">Zenani</a>, born in February 1959, and <a href="Zindzi%20Mandela-Hlongwane">Zindziswa</a>, born in December 1960.

In December 1956, Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive, and accused of "high treason" against the state. Held in Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests, they underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail. The defence's refutation began in January 1957, overseen by defence lawyer <a href="Vernon%20Berrang%C3%A9">Vernon Berrangé</a>, and continued until the case was adjourned in September. In January 1958, <a href="Oswald%20Pirow">Oswald Pirow</a> was appointed to prosecute the case, and in February the judge ruled that there was "sufficient reason" for the defendants to go on trial in the <a href="Gauteng%20Division">Transvaal Supreme Court</a>. The formal <a href="Treason%20Trial">Treason Trial</a> began in <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a> in August 1958, with the defendants successfully applying to have the three judges—all linked to the governing National Party—replaced. In August, one charge was dropped, and in October the prosecution withdrew its indictment, submitting a reformulated version in November which argued that the ANC leadership committed high treason by advocating violent revolution, a charge the defendants denied.

In April 1959, Africanists dissatisfied with the ANC's united front approach founded the <a href="Pan-Africanist%20Congress">Pan-Africanist Congress</a> (PAC); Mandela disagreed with the PAC's racially exclusionary views, describing them as "immature" and "naïve". Both parties took part in an anti-pass campaign in early 1960, in which Africans burned <a href="Pass%20laws">the passes that they were legally obliged to carry</a>. One of the PAC-organised demonstrations was fired upon by police, resulting in the deaths of 69 protesters in the <a href="Sharpeville%20massacre">Sharpeville massacre</a>. The incident brought international condemnation of the government and resulted in rioting throughout South Africa, with Mandela publicly burning his pass in solidarity.

Responding to the unrest, the government implemented state of emergency measures, declaring <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> and banning the ANC and PAC; in March, they arrested Mandela and other activists, imprisoning them for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison. Imprisonment caused problems for Mandela and his co-defendants in the Treason Trial; their lawyers could not reach them, and so it was decided that the lawyers would withdraw in protest until the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August 1960. Over the following months, Mandela used his free time to organise an All-In African Conference near <a href="Pietermaritzburg">Pietermaritzburg</a>, <a href="Natal%20Province">Natal</a>, in March 1961, at which 1,400 anti-apartheid delegates met, agreeing on a stay-at-home strike to mark 31 May, the day South Africa became a republic. On 29 March 1961, six years after the Treason Trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of "high treason", since they had advocated neither communism nor violent revolution; the outcome embarrassed the government.

Disguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled around the country incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike. Referred to as the "Black Pimpernel" in the press—a reference to <a href="Emma%20Orczy">Emma Orczy</a>'s 1905 novel "<a href="The%20Scarlet%20Pimpernel">The Scarlet Pimpernel</a>"—a warrant for his arrest was put out by the police. Mandela held secret meetings with reporters, and after the government failed to prevent the strike, he warned them that many anti-apartheid activists would soon resort to violence through groups like the PAC's <a href="Azanian%20People%27s%20Liberation%20Army">Poqo</a>. He believed that the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of this violence in a controlled direction, convincing both ANC leader <a href="Albert%20Luthuli">Albert Luthuli</a>—who was morally opposed to violence—and allied activist groups of its necessity.

Inspired by the actions of <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a>'s <a href="26th%20of%20July%20Movement">26th of July Movement</a> in the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>, in 1961 Mandela, Sisulu, and Slovo co-founded <a href="Umkhonto%20we%20Sizwe">Umkhonto we Sizwe</a> ("Spear of the Nation", abbreviated MK). Becoming chairman of the militant group, Mandela gained ideas from literature on guerrilla warfare by Marxist militants Mao and <a href="Che%20Guevara">Che Guevara</a> as well as from the military theorist <a href="Carl%20von%20Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a>. Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the latter's reputation, MK was later widely recognised as the party's armed wing. Most early MK members were white communists who were able to conceal Mandela in their homes; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat in <a href="Berea%2C%20Gauteng">Berea</a>, Mandela moved to the communist-owned <a href="Liliesleaf%20Farm">Liliesleaf Farm</a> in <a href="Rivonia">Rivonia</a>, there joined by <a href="Raymond%20Mhlaba">Raymond Mhlaba</a>, Slovo, and Bernstein, who put together the MK constitution. Although in later life Mandela denied, for political reasons, ever being a member of the Communist Party, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s. This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC after Mandela's death. According to the SACP, he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.

Operating through a cell structure, MK planned to carry out acts of sabotage that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties; they sought to bomb military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport links at night, when civilians were not present. Mandela stated that they chose sabotage because it was the least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterwards; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary. Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>, MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on <a href="Day%20of%20the%20Vow">Dingane's Day</a> (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year's Eve.

The ANC decided to send Mandela as a delegate to the February 1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, Ethiopia. Leaving South Africa in secret via <a href="Bechuanaland%20Protectorate">Bechuanaland</a>, on his way Mandela visited <a href="Tanganyika">Tanganyika</a> and met with its president, <a href="Julius%20Nyerere">Julius Nyerere</a>. Arriving in Ethiopia, Mandela met with Emperor <a href="Haile%20Selassie%20I">Haile Selassie I</a>, and gave his speech after Selassie's at the conference. After the symposium, he travelled to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, Egypt, admiring the political reforms of President <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>, and then went to <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a>, Tunisia, where President <a href="Habib%20Bourguiba">Habib Bourguiba</a> gave him £5,000 for weaponry. He proceeded to Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal, receiving funds from Liberian President <a href="William%20Tubman">William Tubman</a> and Guinean President <a href="Ahmed%20S%C3%A9kou%20Tour%C3%A9">Ahmed Sékou Touré</a>. He left Africa for London, England, where he met anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians. Upon returning to Ethiopia, he began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa by the ANC's leadership.

On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist <a href="Cecil%20Williams%20%28anti-apartheid%20activist%29">Cecil Williams</a> near <a href="Howick%2C%20KwaZulu-Natal">Howick</a>. Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence. In later years, <a href="Donald%20Rickard">Donald Rickard</a>, a former American diplomat revealed that the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>, who feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location. Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission. Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase "the ANC's moral opposition to racism" while supporters demonstrated outside the court. Moved to <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, where Winnie could visit him, he began correspondence studies for a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> (LLB) degree from the <a href="University%20of%20London%20International%20Programmes">University of London International Programmes</a>. His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional "<a href="kaross">kaross</a>", refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech. Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang "<a href="Nkosi%20Sikelel%20iAfrika">Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika</a>".

In July 1963, police raided <a href="Liliesleaf%20Farm">Liliesleaf Farm</a>, arresting those they found there and uncovering paperwork documenting MK's activities, some of which mentioned Mandela. The <a href="Rivonia%20Trial">Rivonia Trial</a> began at <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Africa">Pretoria Supreme Court</a> in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was <a href="Percy%20Yutar">Percy Yutar</a>. Judge <a href="Quartus%20de%20Wet">Quartus de Wet</a> soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.

Although four of the accused denied involvement with MK, Mandela and the other five accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the government. They used the trial to highlight their political cause; at the opening of the defence's proceedings, Mandela gave his three-hour "<a href="I%20Am%20Prepared%20to%20Die">I Am Prepared to Die</a>" speech. That speech—which was inspired by Castro's "<a href="History%20Will%20Absolve%20Me">History Will Absolve Me</a>"—was widely reported in the press despite official censorship. The trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> and <a href="World%20Peace%20Council">World Peace Council</a>, while the <a href="University%20of%20London%20Union">University of London Union</a> voted Mandela to its presidency. On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the <a href="death%20sentence">death sentence</a> to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a>.

Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on <a href="Robben%20Island">Robben Island</a>, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring by , with a straw mat on which to sleep. Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 to work in a lime quarry. Mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight. At night, he worked on his LLB degree which he was obtaining from the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> through a correspondence course with <a href="Wolsey%20Hall%2C%20Oxford">Wolsey Hall, Oxford</a>, but newspapers were forbidden, and he was locked in <a href="solitary%20confinement">solitary confinement</a> on several occasions for the possession of smuggled news clippings. He was initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, meaning that he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored.

The political prisoners took part in work and <a href="hunger%20strike">hunger strike</a>s—the latter considered largely ineffective by Mandela—to improve prison conditions, viewing this as a microcosm of the anti-apartheid struggle. ANC prisoners elected him to their four-man "High Organ" along with Sisulu, <a href="Govan%20Mbeki">Govan Mbeki</a>, and <a href="Raymond%20Mhlaba">Raymond Mhlaba</a>, and he involved himself in a group representing all political prisoners (including <a href="Eddie%20Daniels%20%28political%20activist%29">Eddie Daniels</a>) on the island, Ulundi, through which he forged links with PAC and <a href="Yu%20Chi%20Chan%20Club">Yu Chi Chan Club</a> members. Initiating the "University of Robben Island", whereby prisoners lectured on their own areas of expertise, he debated socio-political topics with his comrades.

Though attending Christian Sunday services, Mandela studied Islam. He also studied <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>, hoping to build a mutual respect with the warders and convert them to his cause. Various official visitors met with Mandela, most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative <a href="Helen%20Suzman">Helen Suzman</a> of the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">Progressive Party</a>, who championed Mandela's cause outside of prison. In September 1970, he met British <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> politician <a href="Dennis%20Healey">Dennis Healey</a>. South African Minister of Justice <a href="Jimmy%20Kruger">Jimmy Kruger</a> visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get along with each other. His mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and his firstborn son Thembi died in a car accident the following year; Mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral. His wife was rarely able to see him, being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first visited in December 1975. Winnie was released from prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in <a href="Brandfort">Brandfort</a> and remained unable to see him.

From 1967 onwards, prison conditions improved; black prisoners were given trousers rather than shorts, games were permitted, and the standard of their food was raised. In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was abandoned after the conspiracy was infiltrated by an agent of the <a href="South%20African%20Bureau%20of%20State%20Security">South African Bureau of State Security</a> (BOSS), who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape. In 1970, Commander Piet Badenhorst became commanding officer. Mandela, seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners, complained to visiting judges, who had Badenhorst reassigned. He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.

By 1975, Mandela had become a Class A prisoner, which allowed him greater numbers of visits and letters. He corresponded with anti-apartheid activists like <a href="Mangosuthu%20Buthelezi">Mangosuthu Buthelezi</a> and <a href="Desmond%20Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>. That year, he began his autobiography, which was smuggled to London, but remained unpublished at the time; prison authorities discovered several pages, and his LLB study privileges were revoked for four years. Instead, he devoted his spare time to gardening and reading until the authorities permitted him to resume his LLB degree studies in 1980.

By the late 1960s, Mandela's fame had been eclipsed by <a href="Steve%20Biko">Steve Biko</a> and the <a href="Black%20Consciousness%20Movement">Black Consciousness Movement</a> (BCM). Seeing the ANC as ineffectual, the BCM called for militant action, but following the <a href="Soweto%20uprising">Soweto uprising</a> of 1976, many BCM activists were imprisoned on Robben Island. Mandela tried to build a relationship with these young radicals, although he was critical of their racialism and contempt for white anti-apartheid activists. Renewed international interest in his plight came in July 1978, when he celebrated his 60th birthday. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>, the <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru%20Award">Jawaharlal Nehru Award</a> for International Understanding in India in 1979, and the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freedom of the City</a> of <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, Scotland in 1981. In March 1980, the slogan "Free Mandela!" was developed by journalist <a href="Percy%20Qoboza">Percy Qoboza</a>, sparking an international campaign that led the <a href="UN%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a> to call for his release. Despite increasing foreign pressure, the government refused, relying on its <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> allies US President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and UK Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>; both considered Mandela's ANC a terrorist organisation sympathetic to communism, and supported its suppression.

In April 1982, Mandela was transferred to <a href="Pollsmoor%20Prison">Pollsmoor Prison</a> in <a href="Tokai%2C%20Cape%20Town">Tokai, Cape Town</a>, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, <a href="Ahmed%20Kathrada">Ahmed Kathrada</a>, and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a <a href="roof%20garden">roof garden</a>; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was appointed patron of the multi-racial <a href="United%20Democratic%20Front%20%28South%20Africa%29">United Democratic Front</a> (UDF), founded to combat <a href="South%20African%20Constitution%20of%201983">reforms</a> implemented by South African President <a href="P.%20W.%20Botha">P. W. Botha</a>. Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.

The early 1980s witnessed an escalation of violence across the country, and many predicted civil war. This was accompanied by economic stagnation as various multinational banks—under pressure from an international lobby—had stopped investing in South Africa. Numerous banks and Thatcher asked Botha to release Mandela—then at the height of his international fame—to defuse the volatile situation. Although considering Mandela a dangerous "arch-Marxist", in February 1985 Botha offered him a release from prison if he "unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon". Mandela spurned the offer, releasing a statement through his daughter Zindzi stating, "What freedom am I being offered while the organisation of the people [ANC] remains banned? Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts."

In 1985, Mandela underwent surgery on an enlarged prostate gland, before being given new solitary quarters on the ground floor. He was met by "seven eminent persons", an international delegation sent to negotiate a settlement, but Botha's government refused to co-operate, calling a state of emergency in June and initiating a police crackdown on unrest. The anti-apartheid resistance fought back, with the ANC committing 231 attacks in 1986 and 235 in 1987. The violence escalated as the government used the army and police to combat the resistance, and provided covert support for vigilante groups and the <a href="Zulu%20people">Zulu</a> nationalist movement <a href="Inkatha%20Freedom%20Party">Inkatha</a>, which was involved in an increasingly violent struggle with the ANC. Mandela requested talks with Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice <a href="Kobie%20Coetsee">Kobie Coetsee</a> in 1987, and having a further 11 meetings over the next three years. Coetsee organised negotiations between Mandela and a team of four government figures starting in May 1988; the team agreed to the release of political prisoners and the legalisation of the ANC on the condition that they permanently renounce violence, break links with the Communist Party, and not insist on <a href="majority%20rule">majority rule</a>. Mandela rejected these conditions, insisting that the ANC would only end its armed activities when the government renounced violence.

Mandela's 70th birthday in July 1988 attracted international attention, including <a href="Nelson%20Mandela%2070th%20Birthday%20Tribute">a tribute concert</a> at London's <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> that was televised and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers. Although presented globally as a heroic figure, he faced personal problems when ANC leaders informed him that Winnie had set herself up as head of a gang, the "Mandela United Football Club", which had been responsible for torturing and killing opponents—including children—in Soweto. Though some encouraged him to divorce her, he decided to remain loyal until she was found guilty by trial.

Recovering from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> exacerbated by the damp conditions in his cell, in December 1988 Mandela was moved to <a href="Victor%20Verster%20Prison">Victor Verster Prison</a> near <a href="Paarl">Paarl</a>. He was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and used the time to complete his LLB degree. While there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo.

In 1989, Botha suffered a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, he stepped down as leader of the National Party, to be replaced by <a href="F.%20W.%20de%20Klerk">F. W. de Klerk</a>. In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a> in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, for the first time in 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.

Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February, Mandela held Winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds and the press; the event was broadcast live across the world. Driven to <a href="Cape%20Town%20City%20Hall">Cape Town's City Hall</a> through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but made it clear that the ANC's armed struggle was not over, and would continue as "a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid". He expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations, so that "there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle", and insisted that his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right to vote in national and local elections. Staying at Tutu's home, in the following days Mandela met with friends, activists, and press, giving a speech to an estimated 100,000 people at Johannesburg's <a href="Soccer%20City">Soccer City</a>.

Mandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, and continuing to Sweden, where he was reunited with Tambo, and London, where he appeared at the concert at Wembley Stadium in <a href="Wembley%20Park">Wembley Park</a>. Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, in France he was welcomed by President <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a>, in Vatican City by <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>, and in the United Kingdom by Thatcher. In the United States, he met President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a>, addressed both Houses of Congress and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the <a href="African%20American">African-American</a> community. In Cuba, he became friends with President Castro, whom he had long admired. He met President <a href="R.%20Venkataraman">R. Venkataraman</a> in India, President <a href="Suharto">Suharto</a> in Indonesia, Prime Minister <a href="Mahathir%20Mohamad">Mahathir Mohamad</a> in Malaysia, and Prime Minister <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a> in Australia. He visited Japan, but not the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, a longtime ANC supporter.

In May 1990, Mandela led a multiracial ANC delegation into preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men. Mandela impressed them with his discussions of Afrikaner history, and the negotiations led to the <a href="Groote%20Schuur%20Minute">Groot Schuur Minute</a>, in which the government lifted the state of emergency. In August, Mandela—recognising the ANC's severe military disadvantage—offered a ceasefire, the Pretoria Minute, for which he was widely criticised by MK activists. He spent much time trying to unify and build the ANC, appearing at a Johannesburg conference in December attended by 1600 delegates, many of whom found him more moderate than expected. At the ANC's July 1991 national conference in Durban, Mandela admitted that the party had faults and announced his aim to build a "strong and well-oiled task force" for securing majority rule. At the conference, he was elected ANC President, replacing the ailing Tambo, and a 50-strong multiracial, mixed gendered national executive was elected.

Mandela was given an office in the newly purchased ANC headquarters at <a href="Shell%20House%20%28Johannesburg%29">Shell House</a>, Johannesburg, and moved into Winnie's large Soweto home. Their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her affair with Dali Mpofu, but he supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault. He gained funding for her defence from the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>, but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. On 13 April 1992, Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie. The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of <a href="Houghton%20Estate">Houghton</a>. Mandela's prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in "black-on-black" violence, particularly between ANC and Inkatha supporters in <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a>, which resulted in thousands of deaths. Mandela met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi, but the ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue. Mandela argued that there was a "<a href="Third%20Force%20%28South%20Africa%29">third force</a>" within the state intelligence services fuelling the "slaughter of the people" and openly blamed de Klerk—whom he increasingly distrusted—for the <a href="Sebokeng">Sebokeng</a> massacre. In September 1991, a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg at which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.

The <a href="Convention%20for%20a%20Democratic%20South%20Africa">Convention for a Democratic South Africa</a> (CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Centre, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. Although <a href="Cyril%20Ramaphosa">Cyril Ramaphosa</a> led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure, and after de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the "head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime". Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved. CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a <a href="federalism">federal system</a> with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a <a href="unitary%20state">unitary system</a> governed by majority rule. Following the <a href="Boipatong%20massacre">Boipatong massacre</a> of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting of the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a> in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a <a href="United%20Nations%20peacekeeping">UN peacekeeping force</a> be stationed in South Africa to prevent "<a href="state%20terrorism">state terrorism</a>". Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria.

Following the <a href="Bisho%20massacre">Bisho massacre</a>, in which 28 ANC supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the <a href="Ciskei%20Defence%20Force">Ciskei Defence Force</a> during a protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September. He agreed to do so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures intended to prevent further Inkatha attacks; de Klerk reluctantly agreed. The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year <a href="National%20unity%20government">coalition government of national unity</a> and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. The duo agreed on <a href="South%20African%20Constitution%20of%201993">an interim constitution</a> based on a <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democratic</a> model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style <a href="bill%20of%20rights">bill of rights</a>; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own <a href="premier">premier</a> and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for <a href="federalism">federalism</a> and Mandela's for unitary government.

The democratic process was threatened by the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June 1993, one of the latter—the <a href="Afrikaner%20Weerstandsbeweging">Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging</a> (AWB)—<a href="Storming%20of%20Kempton%20Park%20World%20Trade%20Centre">attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre</a>. Following the murder of ANC activist <a href="Chris%20Hani">Chris Hani</a>, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who had died of a stroke. In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and each receiving the <a href="Liberty%20Medal">Liberty Medal</a>. Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by <a href="Thabo%20Mbeki">Thabo Mbeki</a>, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a> in Switzerland.

With the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People's Forums across the country at which Mandela could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans. The ANC campaigned on a <a href="Reconstruction%20and%20Development%20Programme">Reconstruction and Development Programme</a> (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity. The party's slogan was "a better life for all", although it was not explained how this development would be funded. With the exception of the "<a href="Weekly%20Mail">Weekly Mail</a>" and the "<a href="New%20Nation">New Nation</a>", South Africa's press opposed Mandela's election, fearing continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the National or <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">Democratic Party</a>. Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime. He also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by the ANC, this policy became the subject of ridicule.

Concerned that COSAG would undermine the election, particularly in the wake of the <a href="Bophuthatswana%20conflict%20%281994%29">conflict in Bophuthatswana</a> and the <a href="Shell%20House%20massacre">Shell House massacre</a>—incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha, respectively—Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P. W. Botha, <a href="Pik%20Botha">Pik Botha</a> and <a href="Constand%20Viljoen">Constand Viljoen</a>, persuading many to work within the democratic system. With de Klerk, he also convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession. As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to deem it a victory for Mandela. The election went ahead with little violence, although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. As widely expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National Party each taking another. Mandela voted at the <a href="Ohlange%20High%20School">Ohlange High School</a> in Durban, and though the ANC's victory assured his election as President, he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.

The newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive. His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally. The event was attended by four thousand guests, including world leaders from a wide range of geographic and ideological backgrounds. Mandela headed a <a href="Government%20of%20National%20Unity%20%28South%20Africa%29">Government of National Unity</a> dominated by the ANC—which had no experience of governing by itself—but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha. Under the Interim Constitution, Inkatha and the National Party were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats. In keeping with earlier agreements, both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were given the position of <a href="Deputy%20President%20of%20South%20Africa">Deputy President</a>. Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to shape policy details. Moving into the presidential office at <a href="Tuynhuys">Tuynhuys</a> in Cape Town, Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the <a href="Groote%20Schuur">Groote Schuur</a> estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which he renamed "<a href="Genadendal%20Residence">Genadendal</a>", meaning "Valley of Mercy" in Afrikaans. Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.

Aged 76, he faced various ailments, and although exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely. He often entertained celebrities, such as <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, and the <a href="Spice%20Girls">Spice Girls</a>, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like <a href="Harry%20Oppenheimer">Harry Oppenheimer</a> of <a href="Anglo%20American%20plc">Anglo-American</a>. He also met with <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> on her March 1995 <a href="state%20visit">state visit</a> to South Africa, which earned him strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists. Despite his opulent surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating a third of his <a href="South%20African%20rand">R</a> 552,000 annual income to the <a href="Nelson%20Mandela%20Children%27s%20Fund">Nelson Mandela Children's Fund</a>, which he had founded in 1995. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">freedom of the press</a>, and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too heavily on scaremongering about crime.

In December 1994, Mandela published "<a href="Long%20Walk%20to%20Freedom">Long Walk to Freedom</a>", an autobiography based around a manuscript he had written in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist <a href="Richard%20Stengel">Richard Stengel</a>. In late 1994, he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in <a href="Bloemfontein">Bloemfontein</a>, at which a more militant national executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she expressed an interest in reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995. By 1995, he had entered into a relationship with <a href="Gra%C3%A7a%20Machel">Graça Machel</a>, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president <a href="Samora%20Machel">Samora Machel</a>. They had first met in July 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. She turned down Mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.

Presiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, Mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency. Having seen other post-colonial African economies damaged by the departure of white elites, Mandela worked to reassure South Africa's white population that they were protected and represented in "the <a href="Rainbow%20Nation">Rainbow Nation</a>". Although his Government of National Unity would be dominated by the ANC, he attempted to create a broad coalition by appointing de Klerk as Deputy President and appointing other National Party officials as ministers for Agriculture, Energy, Environment, and Minerals and Energy, as well as naming Buthelezi as Minister for Home Affairs. The other cabinet positions were taken by ANC members, many of whom—like <a href="Joe%20Modise">Joe Modise</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Nzo">Alfred Nzo</a>, Joe Slovo, <a href="Mac%20Maharaj">Mac Maharaj</a> and <a href="Dullah%20Omar">Dullah Omar</a>—had long been comrades of Mandela, although others, such as <a href="Tito%20Mboweni">Tito Mboweni</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Radebe">Jeff Radebe</a>, were far younger. Mandela's relationship with de Klerk was strained; Mandela thought that de Klerk was intentionally provocative, and de Klerk felt that he was being intentionally humiliated by the president. In January 1995, Mandela heavily chastised him for awarding amnesty to 3,500 police officers just before the election, and later criticised him for defending former Minister of Defence <a href="Magnus%20Malan">Magnus Malan</a> when the latter was charged with murder.

Mandela personally met with senior figures of the apartheid regime, including <a href="Hendrik%20Verwoerd">Hendrik Verwoerd</a>'s widow, <a href="Betsie%20Schoombie">Betsie Schoombie</a>, and lawyer <a href="Percy%20Yutar">Percy Yutar</a>, also laying a wreath by the statue of Afrikaner hero <a href="Daniel%20Theron">Daniel Theron</a>. Emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation, he announced that "courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace." He encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the <a href="South%20African%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Springboks</a>, as South Africa hosted the <a href="1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1995 Rugby World Cup</a>. Mandela wore a Springbok shirt at the <a href="1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a> against New Zealand, and after the Springboks won the match, Mandela presented the trophy to captain <a href="Francois%20Pienaar">Francois Pienaar</a>, an Afrikaner. This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as de Klerk later put it, "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans." Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. Among the latter was his estranged wife, Winnie, who accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing the white community than in helping the black majority.

Mandela oversaw the formation of a <a href="Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28South%20Africa%29">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC, appointing Tutu as its chair. To prevent the creation of martyrs, the Commission granted individual amnesties in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid era. Dedicated in February 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in October 1998. Both de Klerk and Mbeki appealed to have parts of the report suppressed, though only de Klerk's appeal was successful. Mandela praised the Commission's work, stating that it "had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future".

Mandela's administration inherited a country with a huge disparity in wealth and services between white and black communities. Of a population of 40 million, around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, and 12 million lacked clean water supplies, with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate. There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line. Government financial reserves were nearly depleted, with a fifth of the national budget being spent on debt repayment, meaning that the extent of the promised Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was scaled back, with none of the proposed nationalisation or job creation. In 1996, the RDP was replaced with a new policy, Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), which maintained South Africa's <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a> but placed an emphasis on economic growth through a framework of <a href="market%20economics">market economics</a> and the encouragement of foreign investment; many in the ANC derided it as a <a href="neo-liberalism">neo-liberal</a> policy that did not address social inequality, no matter how Mandela defended it. In adopting this approach, Mandela's government adhered to the "<a href="Washington%20consensus">Washington consensus</a>" advocated by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> and <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>.

Under Mandela's presidency, welfare spending increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which had previously been set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.

The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 safeguarded the rights of labour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestock. This legislation ensured that such tenants could not be evicted without a court order or if they were over the age of 65. Recognising that arms manufacturing was a key industry for the South African economy, Mandela endorsed the trade in weapons but brought in tighter regulations surrounding <a href="Armscor%20%28South%20Africa%29">Armscor</a> to ensure that South African weaponry was not sold to authoritarian regimes. Under Mandela's administration, tourism was increasingly promoted, becoming a major sector of the South African economy.

Critics like <a href="Edwin%20Cameron">Edwin Cameron</a> accused Mandela's government of doing little to stem the <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later admitted that he had personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed to deal with the problem of corruption.

Further problems were caused by the exodus of thousands of skilled white South Africans from the country, who were escaping the increasing crime rates, higher taxes, and the impact of <a href="positive%20discrimination">positive discrimination</a> toward blacks in employment. This exodus resulted in a <a href="brain%20drain">brain drain</a>, and Mandela criticised those who left. At the same time, South Africa experienced an influx of millions of <a href="Illegal%20immigration">illegal migrants</a> from poorer parts of Africa; although public opinion toward these illegal immigrants was generally unfavourable, characterising them as disease-spreading criminals who were a drain on resources, Mandela called on South Africans to embrace them as "brothers and sisters".

Mandela expressed the view that "South Africa's future foreign relations [should] be based on our belief that human rights should be the core of international relations". Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation. In September 1998, Mandela was appointed Secretary-General of the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>, who held their annual conference in Durban. He used the event to criticise the "narrow, chauvinistic interests" of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the <a href="Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian%20conflict">Israeli–Palestinian conflict</a> and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the <a href="Kashmir%20conflict">Kashmir conflict</a>, for which he was criticised by both Israel and India. Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was prevented by the <a href="1997%20Asian%20financial%20crisis">1997 Asian financial crisis</a>. He extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy. However, under pressure from the PRC, in November 1996 he cut recognition of Taiwan, and in May 1999 paid an official visit to Beijing.

Mandela attracted controversy for his close relationship with Indonesian president <a href="Suharto">Suharto</a>, whose regime was responsible for mass human rights abuses, although on a July 1997 visit to Indonesia he privately urged Suharto to withdraw from the <a href="Indonesian%20occupation%20of%20East%20Timor">occupation of East Timor</a>. He also faced similar criticism from the West for his government's trade links to Syria, Cuba, and Libya, and for his personal friendships with Castro and Gaddafi. Castro visited in 1998 to widespread popular acclaim, and Mandela met Gaddafi in Libya to award him the <a href="Order%20of%20Good%20Hope">Order of Good Hope</a>. When Western governments and media criticised these visits, Mandela lambasted such criticism as having racist undertones, and stated that "the enemies of countries in the West are not our enemies." Mandela hoped to resolve the long-running dispute between Libya and the US and Britain over bringing to trial the two Libyans, <a href="Abdelbaset%20al-Megrahi">Abdelbaset al-Megrahi</a> and <a href="Lamin%20Khalifah%20Fhimah">Lamin Khalifah Fhimah</a>, who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging <a href="Pan%20Am%20Flight%20103">Pan Am Flight 103</a>. Mandela proposed that they be tried in a third country, which was agreed to by all parties; governed by <a href="Scots%20law">Scots law</a>, the trial was held at <a href="Camp%20Zeist%2C%20Netherlands">Camp Zeist</a> in the Netherlands in April 1999, and found one of the two men guilty.

Mandela echoed Mbeki's calls for an "<a href="African%20Renaissance">African Renaissance</a>", and was greatly concerned with issues on the continent. He took a <a href="soft%20power">soft diplomatic</a> approach to removing <a href="Sani%20Abacha">Sani Abacha</a>'s military junta in Nigeria but later became a leading figure in calling for sanctions when Abacha's regime increased human rights violations. In 1996, he was appointed Chairman of the <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">Southern African Development Community</a> (SADC) and initiated unsuccessful negotiations to end the <a href="First%20Congo%20War">First Congo War</a> in <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a>. He also played a key role as a mediator in the ethnic conflict between <a href="Tutsi">Tutsi</a> and <a href="Hutu">Hutu</a> political groups in the <a href="Burundian%20Civil%20War">Burundian Civil War</a>, helping to initiate a settlement which brought increased stability to the country but did not end the ethnic violence. In <a href="South%20African%20intervention%20in%20Lesotho">South Africa's first post-apartheid military operation</a>, troops were ordered in September 1998 into Lesotho to protect the government of Prime Minister <a href="Pakalitha%20Mosisili">Pakalitha Mosisili</a> after a disputed election prompted opposition uprisings. The action was not authorised by Mandela himself, who was out of the country at the time, but by Buthelezi, who was serving as acting president during Mandela's absence.

The new <a href="Constitution%20of%20South%20Africa">Constitution of South Africa</a> was agreed upon by parliament in May 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to place checks on political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy. De Klerk opposed the implementation of this constitution, and that month he and the National Party withdrew from the coalition government in protest, claiming that the ANC were not treating them as equals. The ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the Nationalists, with Mbeki becoming sole Deputy President. Inkatha remained part of the coalition, and when both Mandela and Mbeki were out of the country in September 1998, Buthelezi was appointed "Acting President", marking an improvement in his relationship with Mandela. Although Mandela had often governed decisively in his first two years as President, he had subsequently increasingly delegated duties to Mbeki, retaining only a close personal supervision of intelligence and security measures. During a 1997 visit to London, he said that "the ruler of South Africa, the "de facto" ruler, is Thabo Mbeki" and that he was "shifting everything to him".

Mandela stepped down as ANC President at the party's December 1997 conference. He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed him, believing Mbeki to be too inflexible and intolerant of criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless. Mandela and the Executive supported <a href="Jacob%20Zuma">Jacob Zuma</a>, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President. Zuma's candidacy was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party, although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.

Mandela's relationship with Machel had intensified; in February 1998, he publicly stated that he was "in love with a remarkable lady", and under pressure from Tutu, who urged him to set an example for young people, he organised a wedding for his 80th birthday, in July that year. The following day, he held a grand party with many foreign dignitaries. Although the 1996 constitution allowed the president to serve two consecutive five-year terms, Mandela had never planned to stand for a second term in office. He gave his farewell speech to Parliament on 29 March 1999 when it adjourned prior to the 1999 general elections, after which he retired. Although opinion polls in South Africa showed wavering support for both the ANC and the government, Mandela himself remained highly popular, with 80% of South Africans polled in 1999 expressing satisfaction with his performance as president.

Retiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled "The Presidential Years", it was abandoned before publication. Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, and—when in Johannesburg—working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS. Although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as "a war" that had killed more than "all previous wars"; affiliating himself with the <a href="Treatment%20Action%20Campaign">Treatment Action Campaign</a>, he urged Mbeki's government to ensure that HIV-positive South Africans had access to <a href="anti-retrovirals">anti-retrovirals</a>. Meanwhile, Mandela was successfully treated for <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> in July 2001.

In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the <a href="Mandela%20Rhodes%20Foundation">Mandela Rhodes Foundation</a> was created at <a href="Rhodes%20House">Rhodes House</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, to provide postgraduate scholarships to African students. These projects were followed by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and the <a href="46664%20%28concerts%29">46664 campaign</a> against HIV/AIDS. He gave the closing address at the <a href="XIII%20International%20AIDS%20Conference%2C%202000">XIII International AIDS Conference</a> in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the <a href="XV%20International%20AIDS%20Conference%2C%202004">XV International AIDS Conference</a> in <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, Thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as HIV/AIDS. Mandela publicised AIDS as the cause of his son <a href="Makgatho%20Mandela">Makgatho</a>'s death in January 2005, to defy the stigma about discussing the disease.

Publicly, Mandela became more vocal in criticising Western powers. He strongly opposed the 1999 <a href="War%20in%20Kosovo">NATO intervention in Kosovo</a> and called it an attempt by the world's powerful nations to police the entire world. In 2003, he spoke out against the plans for the US and UK to launch a <a href="war%20in%20Iraq">war in Iraq</a>, describing it as "a tragedy" and lambasting US President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> and UK Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> for undermining the UN, saying, "All that (Mr. Bush) wants is <a href="Iraqi%20oil">Iraqi oil</a>". He attacked the US more generally, asserting that it had committed more "unspeakable atrocities" across the world than any other nation, citing the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Japan</a>; this attracted international controversy, although he later improved his relationship with Blair. Retaining an interest in Libyan-UK relations, he visited Megrahi in <a href="Barlinnie%20prison">Barlinnie prison</a> and spoke out against the conditions of his treatment, referring to them as "psychological persecution".

In June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela announced that he was "retiring from retirement" and retreating from public life, remarking, "Don't call me, I will call you." Although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the Foundation discouraged invitations for him to appear at public events and denied most interview requests.

He retained some involvement in international affairs. In 2005, he founded the Nelson Mandela Legacy Trust, travelling to the US to speak before the <a href="Brookings%20Institution">Brookings Institution</a> and the <a href="NAACP">NAACP</a> on the need for economic assistance to Africa. He spoke with US Senator <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> and President George W. Bush and first met the then-Senator <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>. Mandela also encouraged Zimbabwean President <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> to resign over growing human rights abuses in the country. When this proved ineffective, he spoke out publicly against Mugabe in 2007, asking him to step down "with residual respect and a modicum of dignity." That year, Mandela, Machel, and Desmond Tutu convened a group of world leaders in Johannesburg to contribute their wisdom and independent leadership to some of the world's toughest problems. Mandela announced the formation of this new group, <a href="The%20Elders%20%28organization%29">The Elders</a>, in a speech delivered on his 89th birthday.

Mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu, and a <a href="Nelson%20Mandela%2090th%20Birthday%20Tribute">concert in his honour</a> in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>, London. In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich to help the poor across the world. Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki at any public events that the two attended. Mandela was more at ease with Mbeki's successor, Zuma, although the Nelson Mandela Foundation was upset when his grandson, <a href="Mandla%20Mandela">Mandla Mandela</a>, flew him out to the Eastern Cape to attend a pro-Zuma rally in the midst of a storm in 2009.

In 2004, Mandela successfully campaigned for South Africa to host the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>, declaring that there would be "few better gifts for us" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid. Despite maintaining a low profile during the event due to ill-health, Mandela made his final public appearance during the World Cup closing ceremony, where he received much applause. Between 2005 and 2013, Mandela, and later his family, were embroiled in a series of legal disputes regarding money held in family trusts for the benefit of his descendants. In mid-2013, as Mandela was hospitalised for a lung infection in Pretoria, his descendants were involved in an intra-family legal dispute relating to the burial place of Mandela's children, and ultimately Mandela himself.

In February 2011, Mandela was briefly hospitalised with a <a href="respiratory%20infection">respiratory infection</a>, attracting international attention, before being re-admitted for a lung infection and <a href="gallstone">gallstone</a> removal in December 2012. After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, his lung infection recurred and he was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. In June 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in serious condition. The <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Cape%20Town">Archbishop of Cape Town</a> <a href="Thabo%20Makgoba">Thabo Makgoba</a> visited Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Machel, while Zuma cancelled a trip to Mozambique to visit him the following day. In September 2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital, although his condition remained unstable.

After suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95, at around 20:50 <a href="South%20African%20Standard%20Time">local time</a> (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his family. Zuma publicly announced his death on television, proclaiming ten days of national mourning, a memorial service held at Johannesburg's <a href="FNB%20Stadium">FNB Stadium</a> on 10 December 2013, and 8 December as a national day of prayer and reflection. Mandela's body <a href="Lying%20in%20state">lay in state</a> from 11 to 13 December at the <a href="Union%20Buildings">Union Buildings</a> in Pretoria and a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> was held on 15 December in Qunu. Approximately 90 representatives of foreign states travelled to South Africa to attend memorial events. It was later revealed that 300 million rand originally earmarked for humanitarian development projects had been redirected to finance the funeral. The media was awash with tributes and reminiscences, while images of and tributes to Mandela proliferated across <a href="social%20media">social media</a>. His US$4.1 million estate was left to his widow, other family members, staff, and educational institutions.

Mandela was a practical politician, rather than an intellectual scholar or political theorist. According to biographer Tom Lodge, "for Mandela, politics has always been primarily about enacting stories, about making narratives, primarily about morally exemplary conduct, and only secondarily about ideological vision, more about means rather than ends." Mandela identified as both an <a href="African%20nationalism">African nationalist</a>, an ideological position he held since joining the ANC, and as a socialist.

The historian Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni described Mandela as a "liberal African nationalist–decolonial humanist", while political analyst <a href="Raymond%20Suttner">Raymond Suttner</a> cautioned against labelling Mandela a liberal and stated that Mandela displayed a "hybrid socio-political make-up". Mandela took political ideas from other thinkers—among them Indian independence leaders like Gandhi and Nehru, African-American civil rights activists, and African nationalists like Nkrumah—and applied them to the South African situation. At the same time he rejected other aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many African nationalists. In doing so he synthesised both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from the then-dominant <a href="Afrikaner%20nationalism">Afrikaner nationalism</a> in promoting his anti-apartheid vision.

His political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice, in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through "legal revolution". Over the course of his life, he began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation. When endorsing violence, he did so because he saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about it, perceiving it as a means to get his opponent to the negotiating table. He sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals, and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in South Africa. This willingness to use violence distinguishes Mandela from the ideology of <a href="Gandhism">Gandhism</a>, with which some commentators have sought to associate him.

Although he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them. He had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s. He held a conviction that "inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech" were the fundamentals of democracy, and was driven by a belief in <a href="natural%20and%20legal%20rights">natural</a> and human rights. Suttner argued that there were "two modes of leadership" that Mandela adopted. On one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.

According to Lodge, Mandela's political thought reflected tensions between his support for <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democracy</a> and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making. He was an admirer of British-style <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a>, stating that "I regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration." In this he has been described as being committed to "the Euro-North American modernist project of emancipation", something which distinguishes him from other African nationalist and socialist leaders like Nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were Western, rather than African, in origin. Mandela nevertheless also expressed admiration for what he deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing Xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as "democracy in its purest form". He also spoke of an influential African ethical tenet, <a href="Ubuntu%20%28philosophy%29">Ubuntu</a>, which was a <a href="Nguni%20languages">Ngnuni term</a> meaning "A person is a person through other persons" or "I am because we are."

Mandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society, with Sampson describing him as being "openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money". Mandela was influenced by <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, and during the revolution he advocated <a href="scientific%20socialism">scientific socialism</a>. He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial, and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists, and in his autobiography. According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, "sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not." Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela "embraced communism and communists" in the late 1950s and early 1960s, while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the <a href="Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism">Marxist–Leninist</a> ideology by 1960.

Ellis also found evidence that Mandela had been an active member of the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist–Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.

The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a <a href="social%20democracy">social democratic</a> economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the <a href="socialist%20states">socialist states</a> in the Soviet Union and <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> during the early 1990s.

Mandela was widely considered a <a href="Charismatic%20authority">charismatic leader</a>, described by biographer <a href="Mary%20Benson%20%28campaigner%29">Mary Benson</a> as "a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people". He was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner. His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his "charismatic power". While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the "African gentleman", having "the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech" associated with such a position. In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became "one of the first media politicians ... embodying a glamour and a style that projected "visually" a brave new African world of modernity and freedom". Mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day, and he became so associated with highly coloured <a href="Batik">Batik</a> shirts after assuming the presidency that they came to be known as "<a href="Madiba%20shirt">Madiba shirt</a>s".

For political scientists <a href="Betty%20Glad">Betty Glad</a> and Robert Blanton, Mandela was an "exceptionally intelligent, shrewd, and loyal leader". His official biographer, <a href="Anthony%20Sampson">Anthony Sampson</a>, commented that he was a "master of imagery and performance", excelling at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing sound bites. His public speeches were presented in a formal, stiff manner, and often consisted of clichéd set phrases. He typically spoke slowly, and carefully chose his words. Although he was not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed "his personal commitment, charm and humour".

Mandela was a private person who often concealed his emotions and confided in very few people. Privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as President made his own bed. Renowned for his mischievous sense of humour, he was known for being both stubborn and loyal, and at times exhibited a quick temper. He was typically friendly and welcoming, and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone, including his opponents. A self-described <a href="Anglophile">Anglophile</a>, he claimed to have lived by the "trappings of British style and manners". Constantly polite and courteous, he was attentive to all, irrespective of their age or status, and often talked to children or servants. He was known for his ability to find common ground with very different communities. In later life, he always looked for the best in people, even defending political opponents to his allies, who sometimes thought him too trusting of others. He was fond of <a href="Indian%20cuisine">Indian cuisine</a>, and had a lifelong interest in archaeology and boxing.

He was raised in the Methodist denomination of Christianity; the <a href="Methodist%20Church%20of%20Southern%20Africa">Methodist Church of Southern Africa</a> claimed that he retained his allegiance to them throughout his life. On analysing Mandela's writings, the theologian <a href="Dion%20Forster">Dion Forster</a> described him as a <a href="Christian%20humanism">Christian humanist</a>, although added that his thought relied to a greater extent on the Southern African concept of Ubuntu than on <a href="Christian%20theology">Christian theology</a>. According to Sampson, Mandela never had "a strong religious faith" however, while Boehmer stated that Mandela's religious belief was "never robust".

Mandela was very self-conscious about being a man and regularly made references to <a href="manhood">manhood</a>. He was <a href="heterosexuality">heterosexual</a>, and biographer <a href="Fatima%20Meer">Fatima Meer</a> said that he was "easily tempted" by women. Another biographer, <a href="Martin%20Meredith">Martin Meredith</a>, characterised him as being "by nature a romantic", highlighting that he had relationships with various women. Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren and at least seventeen great-grandchildren. He could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren. His first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase in October 1944; they divorced in March 1958 under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact that she was a Jehovah's Witness, a religion requiring political neutrality. Mandela's second wife was the social worker Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, whom he married in June 1958, although they divorced in March 1996. Mandela married his third wife, Graça Machel, on his 80th birthday in July 1998.

By the time of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely considered both "the father of the nation" and "the founding father of democracy". Outside of South Africa, he was a "global icon", with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard describing him as "one of the most revered figures of our time". One biographer considered him "a modern democratic hero", while his popularity resulted in a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a> building up around him. Some have portrayed Mandela in messianic terms, in contrast to his own statement that "I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances." He is often cited alongside <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> and <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders. Boehmer described him as "a totem of the totemic values of our age: toleration and liberal democracy" and "a universal symbol of social justice".

Mandela's international fame had emerged during his incarceration in the 1980s, when he became the world's most famous prisoner, a symbol of the anti-apartheid cause, and an icon for millions who embraced the ideal of human equality. In 1986, Mandela's biographer characterised him as "the embodiment of the struggle for liberation" in South Africa. Meredith stated that in becoming "a potent symbol of resistance" to apartheid during the 1980s, he had gained "mythical status" internationally. Sampson commented that even during his life, this myth had become "so powerful that it blurs the realities", converting Mandela into "a secular saint". Within a decade of the end of his Presidency, Mandela's era was being widely thought of as "a golden age of hope and harmony", with much <a href="nostalgia">nostalgia</a> being expressed for it. His name was often invoked by those criticising his successors like Mbeki and Zuma. Across the world, Mandela earned international acclaim for his activism in overcoming apartheid and fostering racial reconciliation, coming to be viewed as "a moral authority" with a great "concern for truth". Mandela's iconic status has been blamed for concealing the complexities of his life.

Mandela generated controversy throughout his career as an activist and politician, having detractors on both the right and the radical left. During the 1980s, Mandela was widely labelled a terrorist by prominent political figures in the Western world for his embrace of political violence. According to Thatcher, for instance, the ANC was "a typical terrorist organisation". The US government's <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Defense</a> departments officially designated the ANC as a terrorist organisation, resulting in Mandela remaining on their terrorism watch-list until 2008. On the left, some voices in the ANC—among them <a href="Frank%20B.%20Wilderson%20III">Frank B. Wilderson III</a>—accused him of <a href="selling%20out">selling out</a> for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government and for not implementing the reforms of the Freedom Charter during his Presidency. According to Barnard, "there is also a sense in which his chiefly bearing and mode of conduct, the very respect and authority he accrued in representing his nation in his own person, went against the spirit of democracy", and concerns were similarly expressed that he placed his own status and celebrity above the transformation of his country. His government would be criticised for its failure to deal with both the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the high levels of poverty in South Africa. Mandela was also criticised for his friendship with political leaders such as Castro, Gaddafi, and Suharto—deemed <a href="dictators">dictators</a> by critics—as well as his refusal to condemn their governments' human rights violations.

Over the course of his life, Mandela was given over 250 awards, accolades, prizes, honorary degrees and citizenships in recognition of his political achievements.
Among his awards were the Nobel Peace Prize, the US <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, the Soviet Union's <a href="Lenin%20Peace%20Prize">Lenin Peace Prize</a>, and the Libyan <a href="Al-Gaddafi%20International%20Prize%20for%20Human%20Rights">Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights</a>. In 1990, India awarded him the <a href="Bharat%20Ratna">Bharat Ratna</a>, and in 1992 Pakistan gave him their <a href="Nishan-e-Pakistan">Nishan-e-Pakistan</a>. The same year, he was awarded the Atatürk Peace Award by Turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights violations committed by Turkey at the time, but later accepted the award in 1999. He was appointed to the <a href="Order%20of%20Isabella%20the%20Catholic">Order of Isabella the Catholic</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a>, and was the first living person to be made an <a href="Honorary%20Citizenship%20of%20Canada">honorary Canadian citizen</a>. Queen Elizabeth II appointed him as a Bailiff Grand Cross of the <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20John%20%28chartered%201888%29">Order of St. John</a> and granted him membership in the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a>.

In 2004, Johannesburg granted Mandela the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freedom of the City</a>, and in 2008 a Mandela statue was unveiled at the spot where Mandela was released from prison. On the <a href="Day%20of%20Reconciliation">Day of Reconciliation</a> 2013, a bronze statue of Mandela was unveiled at Pretoria's Union Buildings.
In November 2009, the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> proclaimed Mandela's birthday, 18 July, as "<a href="Mandela%20Day">Mandela Day</a>", marking his contribution to the anti-apartheid struggle. It called on individuals to donate 67 minutes to doing something for others, commemorating the 67 years that Mandela had been a part of the movement. In 2015 the UN General Assembly named the amended <a href="Standard%20Minimum%20Rules%20for%20the%20Treatment%20of%20Prisoners">Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners</a> as "the Mandela Rules" to honour his legacy.

The first biography of Mandela was authored by <a href="Mary%20Benson%20%28campaigner%29">Mary Benson</a>, based on brief interviews with him that she had conducted in the 1960s. Two authorised biographies were later produced by friends of Mandela. The first was Fatima Meer's "Higher Than Hope", which was heavily influenced by Winnie and thus placed great emphasis on Mandela's family. The second was Anthony Sampson's "Mandela", published in 1999. Other biographies included Martin Meredith's "Mandela", first published in 1997, and Tom Lodge's "Mandela", brought out in 2006.

Since the late 1980s, Mandela's image began to appear on a proliferation of items, among them "photographs, paintings, drawings, statues, public murals, buttons, t-shirts, refrigerator magnets, and more", items that have been characterised as "Mandela kitsch". In the 1980s he was the subject of several songs, such as <a href="The%20Specials">The Special AKA</a>'s "<a href="Free%20Nelson%20Mandela">Free Nelson Mandela</a>" and <a href="Hugh%20Masekela">Hugh Masekela</a>'s "<a href="Bring%20Him%20Back%20Home%20%28Nelson%20Mandela%29">Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)</a>", which helped to bring awareness of his imprisonment to an international audience. Following his death, there appeared many <a href="internet%20meme">internet meme</a>s featuring images of Mandela with his inspirational quotes superimposed onto them. Mandela has also been depicted in films on multiple occasions. Some of these, such as the 2013 feature film "" and the 1996 documentary "Mandela", have focused on covering his long life, whereas others, such as the 2009 feature film "<a href="Invictus%20%28film%29">Invictus</a>" and the 2010 documentary "<a href="The%2016th%20Man">The 16th Man</a>", have focused on specific events in his life. It has been argued that in "Invictus" and other films, "the America film industry" has played a significant part in "the crafting of Mandela's global image".

Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)

<a href="Air%20Vice-Marshal">Air Vice-Marshal</a> Joseph Eric Hewitt, <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (13 April 1901 – 1 November 1985) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). A <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> officer who transferred permanently to the Air Force in 1928, he commanded <a href="No.%20101%20Flight%20RAAF">No. 101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight</a> in the early 1930s, and <a href="No.%20104%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 104 (Bomber) Squadron RAF</a> on exchange in Britain shortly before World War II. Appointed the RAAF's Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in 1941, Hewitt was posted the following year to Allied Air Forces Headquarters, <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a>, as Director of Intelligence. In 1943, he took command of <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group</a>, the RAAF's main mobile strike force, but was controversially sacked by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, less than a year later over alleged morale and disciplinary issues.

Described as a "small, dapper man" who was "outspoken, even 'cocky'", Hewitt overcame the setback to his career during the war and made his most significant contributions afterwards, as Air Member for Personnel from 1945 to 1948. Directly responsible for the demobilisation of thousands of wartime staff and the consolidation of what was then the world's fourth largest air force into a much smaller peacetime service, he also modernised education and training within the RAAF. Hewitt was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1951, the same year he became Air Member for Supply and Equipment. Retiring from the military in 1956, he went into business and later managed his own publishing house. He wrote two books including "Adversity in Success", a first-hand account of the South West Pacific air war, before his death in 1985 at the age of 84.

Born on 13 April 1901 in <a href="Tylden%2C%20Victoria">Tylden</a>, Victoria, Joe Hewitt was the son of <a href="Reverend">Reverend</a> J.H. Hewitt. He attended <a href="Scotch%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Scotch College, Melbourne</a>, before entering the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a> at <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a> in 1915, aged 13. Graduating in 1919, Hewitt rose to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the RAN before volunteering for secondment to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) as a <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in January 1923. He undertook the pilots' course at <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, and graduated at the end of the year. Hewitt was further seconded to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> on 4 May 1925, holding a temporary commission as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>; this commission was cancelled on 25 September. He married Lorna Bishop on 10 November; they had three daughters.
Hewitt joined the newly formed <a href="No.%20101%20Flight%20RAAF">No. 101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight</a>, operating <a href="Supermarine%20Seagull%20%281921%29">Seagull III</a> <a href="Amphibious%20aircraft">amphibians</a>, in August 1926. Prior to the unit deploying to <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> to survey the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> with <a href="HMAS%20Moresby%20%281918%29">HMAS "Moresby"</a>, he practiced manoeuvres around the centre of Melbourne, landing in the <a href="Yarra%20River">Yarra River</a> near <a href="Flinders%20Street%20railway%20station">Flinders Street station</a>. Media criticism of the escapade led to him being brought before the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Group Captain <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, who rather than upbraiding Hewitt expressed himself "reservedly pleased about the publicity". After completing its survey work in November 1928, the unit served aboard the seaplane carrier <a href="HMAS%20Albatross%20%28seaplane%20tender%29">HMAS "Albatross"</a>.

Hewitt's transfer to the Air Force had been made permanent in 1928. He became commanding officer of No. 101 Flight in February 1931, and supervised embarkation of the Seagull aboard the <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> <a href="HMAS%20Australia%20%28D84%29">HMAS "Australia"</a> in September–October 1932, by which time he had been promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>. Finishing his tour with No. 101 Flight the following year, Hewitt was posted to Britain in 1934. He attended <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, in his first year abroad, and served as Assistant Liaison Officer at <a href="High%20Commission%20of%20Australia%20in%20London">Australia House</a>, London, in 1935. Although a specialist seaplane pilot, he converted to bombers while in England, flying <a href="Hawker%20Hind">Hawker Hind</a>s and <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a>s as the commanding officer of <a href="No.%20104%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 104 Squadron RAF</a> from 1936.

Returning to Australia in 1938, Hewitt was appointed senior air staff officer at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, and by July that year had been promoted <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>. In May 1939, he was chosen to lead <a href="No.%2010%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 10 Squadron</a>, due to be formed on 1 July at the recently established <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Rathmines">RAAF Station Rathmines</a>, near <a href="City%20of%20Lake%20Macquarie">Lake Macquarie</a>. Hewitt was preparing to depart for England to take delivery of the unit's planned complement of <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> flying boats when he broke his neck riding his motor cycle near Richmond, and had to forgo the assignment while he recovered. Fit for duty by August, he was given command of the Rathmines base to manage the deployment of No. 10 Squadron and its aircraft, but this was suspended due to the outbreak of World War II in September, and the Sunderlands and their RAAF crews remained in Britain for service alongside the RAF.

On 20 November 1939, the RAAF formed No. 1 Group in Melbourne, which evolved into <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area Command</a> early in 1940 with Hewitt as senior administration staff officer. Having been promoted <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, he was made Director of Personal Services (DPS) after completing his posting to Southern Area, and was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> on 11 July. Described as having "a <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> background and rigid ideas on women's place in society", as DPS he opposed the creation of the <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> (WAAAF) and later advocated that its members be enrolled on a contractual basis rather than enlisted or commissioned as Permanent Air Force staff. In 1941, Hewitt became Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, before being assigned in April the following year to the newly formed Allied Air Forces Headquarters (AAF HQ), <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA), as Director of Intelligence. He established cordial working relations with his American peers at AAF HQ, becoming a confidant of its commander, Major General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>.

Promoted <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>, in February 1943 Hewitt was appointed <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group</a> (No. 9 OG). The RAAF's premier mobile strike force, No. 9 OG initially comprised seven Australian combat squadrons and came under the control of the US <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>. The month he took over, Hewitt's squadrons were reorganised into two wings based in <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>: <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a>, comprising units at <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a>, New Guinea, and <a href="No.%2073%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 73 Wing</a>, comprising those at <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>. In March, No. 9 OG led the RAAF's contribution to the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, "the decisive aerial engagement" in the SWPA according to General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, resulting in 12 Japanese ships being sunk.
By April 1943, Hewitt had been dragged into the <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29%23Divided%20command">divisive personal conflict</a> between the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, and the AOC of <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>. RAAF Command was the Air Force's main operational formation in the Pacific, controlling 24 Australian squadrons. Jones, administrative and "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" head of the RAAF, sought to extend his authority into the sphere of operations by posting a "more accountable" officer into Bostock's position, namely Hewitt. The <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Air</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Drakeford">Arthur Drakeford</a>, backed Jones' manoeuvre but was informed by <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> that General MacArthur, as Supreme Commander SWPA, "would insist on the replacement of AVM Bostock by an equally able officer", and that "Air Commodore Hewitt ... was not considered an adequate replacement."

No changes were made to command arrangements in the South West Pacific following this episode, and Hewitt continued to lead No. 9 OG in its bombing and strafing campaign against Japanese airfields and lines of communication in <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, north-east of New Guinea. By mid-June 1943, he had set up Group Headquarters at Milne Bay, and No. 73 Wing HQ at <a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a>. On 22 July, he mounted an operation against <a href="Gasmata%20Airport">Gasmata airfield</a> using 62 aircraft from five of his squadrons, the largest strike undertaken by the Australians to that date. No. 9 OG would take most of the credit for the RAAF reaching a peak of 254 tons of bombs dropped in October, as against 137 tons delivered the previous month. On 8 November, Hewitt sent out a formation of three <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s in a severe electrical storm to attack the heavily defended harbour at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>. This was conceived as a "make or break" effort to prove the worth or otherwise of the Beaufort as a torpedo bomber, in which role it had so far been a disappointment; in what the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of the RAAF in World War II</a> described as "an heroic attack", at least one enemy <a href="Tank%20ship">tanker</a> was struck, for the loss of one Beaufort.

Although Hewitt was performing an "excellent job" according to Fifth Air Force commander Major General <a href="Ennis%20Whitehead">Ennis Whitehead</a>, he was controversially removed from his post in mid-November 1943 by Air Vice Marshal Jones, over accusations of poor discipline and morale within No. 9 OG. RAAF historian Alan Stephens later described the circumstances of Hewitt's dismissal as "murky", and the allegations leading to it as unofficial. Drakeford defended Hewitt's service record, informing the Prime Minister that "the present position may be largely, if not entirely, due to some temporary physical stress brought about by the strain of his important duties as A.O.C. of No. 9 Group." Hewitt himself believed that he had been smeared by a disgruntled former staff officer; historian Kristen Alexander identified Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, who would play a leading part in the "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>" of 1945, as having made allegations regarding Hewitt's supposed "lack of balance, vanity and lack of purpose in the prosecution of the war". As a result, Hewitt returned to his previous position as Director of Intelligence at Allied Air Headquarters, while the Air Member of Personnel, Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a>, took over as AOC No. 9 OG in December. General Kenney considered Hewitt's removal "bad news".

After completing his tour as Director of Intelligence at AAF HQ at the end of 1944, Hewitt became acting <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Personnel%20%28Australia%29">Air Member for Personnel</a> (AMP) in 1945. As AMP, Hewitt sat on the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, the RAAF's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. Along with the other members of the board, he reviewed the findings of the inquiry by Justice <a href="John%20Vincent%20Barry">John Vincent Barry</a> into the "Morotai Mutiny", which had involved senior pilots of the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> (No. 1 TAF) attempting to resign their commissions to protest the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to strategically unimportant ground attack missions. Hewitt recommended that the AOC No. 1 TAF, Air Commodore <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>, be removed from command, along with his two senior staff officers. The majority of the Air Board saw no reason to take such action, leaving Hewitt to append a dissenting note to its decision. Drakeford supported Hewitt's position, and the three senior No. 1 TAF officers were later dismissed from their posts by Air Vice Marshal Jones.

Hewitt's appointment as Air Member for Personnel was made permanent following the end of World War II in August 1945. In this role he was directly responsible for the demobilisation of what had become the world's fourth largest air force, and its transition to a much smaller peacetime service. Hewitt considered that the RAAF was in danger of losing some of its best staff through rapid, unplanned demobilisation, and recommended that its workforce be stabilised for two years at a strength of 20,000 while it reviewed its post-war requirements. Although the Air Board supported Hewitt's proposal, government cost-cutting resulted in the strength of the so-called Interim Air Force remaining lower than planned, being reduced to some 13,000 by October 1946 and under 8,000 by the end of 1948. Despite claiming that employing women in the Air Force was an important factor in reducing "antagonism and prejudice" against them in the work force in general, Hewitt also recommended that the WAAAF be disbanded after the war.

As AMP, Hewitt was responsible for reviewing the potential employment of senior officers in the post-war Air Force. This review led to the early retirement of such figures as Air Marshal <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a> and Air Vice Marshals <a href="Stanley%20Goble">Stanley Goble</a>, <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>, <a href="Frank%20Hubert%20McNamara">Frank McNamara</a>, <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Bill Anderson</a>, <a href="Henry%20Wrigley">Henry Wrigley</a> and <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a>, ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. Hewitt helped draft the letters to each of the retirees, explaining the reasons for the decision and redundancy payments involved. He also had the "thankless task" of rationalising the "Air Force List" of officers and their seniority, which had become a source of numerous irregularities due to the temporary and acting promotions granted during wartime. This resulted in many officers of senior rank being 'demoted' as many as three levels, such as group captain to flight lieutenant, in the first post-war "List" released in June 1947.

Hewitt was responsible for initiating major improvements in Air Force education that took place between 1945 and 1953, playing a key role in the establishment of <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a> and the introduction of an apprenticeship training programme. The purpose of the College was, in Hewitt's words, to "sow the seeds of service" for future leaders, helping create a special RAAF "<a href="Morale">esprit de corps</a>". He added that it was "almost a truism that the future RAAF can be no better than the Air Force College". Founded at Point Cook in January 1948, RAAF College's inaugural commandant was Air Commodore <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Val Hancock</a>, who also drafted its first charter. With the support of the Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Ellis%20Wackett">Ellis Wackett</a>, Hewitt developed the Apprenticeship Training Scheme to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, introducing it with a nationwide publicity campaign to attract recruits. Its base was the Ground Training School, which opened at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Wagga">Wagga</a>, New South Wales, in early 1948 to provide education and technical training for youths aged 15 to 17. It was renamed RAAF Technical College in 1950 and then the RAAF School of Technical Training in 1952.

Parallel to his initiatives in Air Force education and training, Hewitt introduced a revised aircrew ranking scheme that consisted of skill categories with various levels, such as navigator level 4 or pilot level 1, rather than the regular military ranks such as sergeant or flight lieutenant. This was abandoned in 1950 due to dissatisfaction caused by the lack of obvious equivalence between these specialist 'ranks' and the traditional ranking system common to the rest of the RAAF and other defence forces. After completing his term as Air Member for Personnel in 1948, he was posted to London as the Australian Defence Representative. By now promoted air vice marshal, Hewitt was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1951 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. Returning from Britain the same year, he took over as Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) from Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Mackinolty">George Mackinolty</a>, who had died suddenly of cancer. Hewitt served as AMSE until his retirement from the RAAF in April 1956. In this role, he again cooperated with Air Vice Marshal Wackett—now the Air Member for Technical Services—to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on 'life-of-type', whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed operationally, to reduce support costs and delivery times.

Following his retirement from the Air Force in 1956, Hewitt joined <a href="International%20Harvester">International Harvester Co. Australia</a> as Manager of Education and Training. He became a trustee of the Services Canteen Trust the same year, serving in this position until 1977. Having retired from International Harvester in 1966, Hewitt became an author in later life and wrote two books on his experiences in the military. The first, "Adversity in Success", was published in 1980 and gave his account of the air war in the South West Pacific. He followed it in 1984 with "The Black One". Hewitt also acted as chairman and managing director of his own publishing house, Langate Publishing. Predeceased by his wife Lorna, he died on 1 November 1985.

Hewitt is credited with being primarily responsible for the "education revolution" that took place in the RAAF between 1945 and 1953, his initiatives while Air Member for Personnel being carried on by his successor in the position, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a>. According to Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, the importance of RAAF College and the Apprenticeship Training Scheme in contributing to the professionalism of the post-war service "cannot be over-stated". Air Vice Marshal <a href="Ernie%20Hey">Ernie Hey</a>, the Air Member for Technical Services from 1960 through 1972, declared that the apprenticeship programme was "one of the best things" the RAAF ever established and its graduates—numbering some 5,500 from 1952 to 1993—as "absolutely outstanding". Joe Hewitt is commemorated by Hewitt Reef in <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef%20Marine%20Park">Great Barrier Reef Marine Park</a>, named in his honour by the survey team on HMAS "Moresby", with whom he worked as a member of No. 101 Flight in 1926–28.

If Day

If Day (, "If one day") was a simulated <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi German</a> invasion and occupation of the Canadian city of <a href="Winnipeg%2C%20Manitoba">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>, and surrounding areas on 19 February 1942, during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. It was organized by the Greater Winnipeg Victory Loan organization, which was led by prominent Winnipeg businessman <a href="John%20Draper%20Perrin">J. D. Perrin</a>. The event was the largest military exercise in Winnipeg to that point.

If Day included a staged firefight between Canadian troops and volunteers dressed as German soldiers, the internment of prominent politicians, the imposition of Nazi rule, and a parade. The event was a fundraiser for the war effort: over $3 million was collected in Winnipeg on that day. Organizers believed that the fear induced by the event would help increase fundraising objectives. It was the subject of a 2006 documentary, and was included in <a href="Guy%20Maddin">Guy Maddin</a>'s film "<a href="My%20Winnipeg">My Winnipeg</a>".

If Day was an elaborate campaign to promote the purchase of <a href="war%20bond">Victory Bonds</a>. These bonds, which were loans to the government to allow for increased war spending, were sold to individuals and corporations throughout Canada. If Day was the second Victory Loan campaign of the Second World War. The campaign began on 16 February 1942, and continued until 9 March. <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>'s fundraising target was $45 million ($620 million in 2011 dollars), including $24.5 million from <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>. The Greater Winnipeg Victory Loan committee, a regional branch of the <a href="National%20War%20Finance%20Committee">National War Finance Committee</a>, organized If Day under chairman <a href="John%20Draper%20Perrin">John Draper Perrin</a>. The organizers believed that bringing the war (or, rather, a simulation thereof) to people's homes would result in a change of attitude among those not directly affected by the war.

The committee drew up a map of Manitoba, which was divided into 45 sections, each representing $1 million of their fundraising target. As money came in from those selling Victory Bonds, the sections were "reclaimed" from the Nazi invaders. The map was posted at the corner of Portage and Main, the city's central intersection. The campaign was publicized in local newspapers for a few days before the event, although the "invasion" took many citizens by surprise. To prevent a rush to emergency shelters, residents of neighbouring northern <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> were also warned because radio broadcasts dramatizing the event could be received in that area. <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> aircraft painted to look like German fighter planes flew over the city on 18 February 1942. <a href="Selkirk%2C%20Manitoba">Selkirk</a>, a small town northeast of Winnipeg, held its own fundraising simulation, a one-hour blackout and mock bombing, on 18 February 1942 in preparation for the main If Day event.

The simulation included 3,500 Canadian Army members, representing all of Winnipeg's units, making it the largest military exercise in Winnipeg to that point. The defending forces were commanded by <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a>s E. A. Pridham and D. S. McKay. Troops were drawn from the <a href="18th%20%28Manitoba%29%20Armoured%20Car%20Regiment">18th (Manitoba) Armoured Car Regiment</a>, No. 10 District Engineers and Signals, <a href="Royal%20Winnipeg%20Rifles">the Royal Winnipeg Rifles</a>, <a href="the%20Winnipeg%20Grenadiers">the Winnipeg Grenadiers</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Winnipeg%20Rifles">Winnipeg Light Infantry</a>, <a href="the%20Queen%27s%20Own%20Cameron%20Highlanders%20of%20Canada">the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada</a>, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Canadian%20Army%23Veteran%27s%20Guard%20of%20Canada">Veteran's Guard of Canada</a> (including over 300 veterans of the First World War), and a number of reserve and civilian groups. The 'Nazi' troops were volunteers from the Young Men's Board of Trade, using uniforms rented from <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> and with painted <a href="Dueling%20scar">sabre scars</a> on their faces. They were commanded by Erich von Neurenberg. Approximately $3,000 was spent on the event.

'Nazi' patrols in the city began before 5:30 am on 19 February. A radio announcer was detained and his microphone commandeered for radio broadcasts, beginning at 5:45 am. 'Nazi' troops assembled on the west side of the city half an hour after the first patrols. Canadian troops were massed at Fort Osborne barracks and the Minto and Macgregor armouries at 6:30 am, and at 7:00 am <a href="civil%20defense%20siren">air-raid sirens</a> were sounded and a <a href="blackout%20%28wartime%29">blackout</a> ordered in preparation for the invasion. The aerial <a href="blitzkrieg">blitzkrieg</a> began before 7 am with mock bombings. Beginning at 7:03 am, troops started their simulated attack on the city, which was defended by a small group of active and reserve troops assisted by local community groups. The defenders formed a perimeter around the industrial and downtown areas of the city, approximately from City Hall, retreating to a perimeter at 7:45.

The firefight included large-scale troop movements and the simulated destruction of major bridges – coal dust and dynamite were used to create explosions. Nine troop formations held three positions each during the tightly scripted invasion sequence; they were directed via telephone (one line per formation) and <a href="flash-lamp">flash-lamp</a> signals from the headquarters established at the Chamber of Commerce building. The defensive pattern employed was similar to that used during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to conduct soldiers to the <a href="front%20%28military%29">front</a>. Light tanks were stationed at road and rail junctions as fighting intensified. Thirty anti-aircraft vehicles fired <a href="blank%20%28cartridge%29">blanks</a> at fighter planes overhead, assisted by anti-aircraft gunners on buildings downtown. The first mock casualty was reported at 8:00 am. Dressing stations were set up at strategic points to treat the mock casualties; they also treated the two real casualties of the event – a soldier who sprained his ankle, and a woman who cut her thumb preparing toast during the early-morning blackout.
At 9:30 am, the defenders surrendered to the 'Nazis' and withdrew to the downtown muster point, and the city was occupied. The fake Nazis began a widespread harassment campaign, sending armed troops throughout the city. A tank was driven down Portage Avenue, one of the main streets of the downtown area. Some people were taken to an internment camp at <a href="Lower%20Fort%20Garry">Lower Fort Garry</a>; those interned included prominent local politicians like Premier <a href="John%20Bracken">John Bracken</a> (arrested with several members of his <a href="cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a> at a <a href="caucus">caucus</a> meeting), Mayor <a href="John%20Queen">John Queen</a>, <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Manitoba">Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba</a> <a href="Roland%20Fairbairn%20McWilliams">Roland Fairbairn McWilliams</a>, and visiting Norwegian ambassador to the United States . One council member, Dan McClean, escaped but was recaptured after an intensive search. Chief of Police George Smith avoided capture because he was dining out when soldiers arrived at his office. The <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> at Lower Fort Garry was replaced with the <a href="flag%20of%20Nazi%20Germany">swastika</a>. The city was renamed "<a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Himmlerstadt</a>", and Main Street was termed "Hitlerstrasse".

Erich von Neurenberg was installed as "<a href="gauleiter">gauleiter</a>" (provincial leader); he was assisted by George Waight, who acted as the local <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> chief. Their stated purpose was to assist Hitler in his plans to take advantage of Canada's relatively low population density by colonizing the country. Von Neurenberg issued the following decree, which was posted throughout the city:
NO ONE WILL ACT, SPEAK OR THINK CONTRARY TO OUR DECREES.
Notices were posted on churches forbidding worship services, and priests who objected were arrested. Buses were stopped and their passengers searched by armed troops. The "<a href="Winnipeg%20Tribune">Winnipeg Tribune</a>" was renamed "Das Winnipeger Lügenblatt" ("The Winnipeg Lies-sheet"), a 'Nazi' publication featuring heavily censored columns and a front page written almost entirely in German. One satirical story noted that "this is a great day for Manitoba ...The Nazis, like Der Fuehrer, are patient, kind and tolerant, but THEIR PATIENCE IS RAPIDLY EXHAUSTED BECOMING", while another included an "official joke", approved by the German authorities, at which all readers were ordered to laugh or be imprisoned. Henry Weppler, a newspaper seller for the "<a href="Winnipeg%20Free%20Press">Winnipeg Free Press</a>", was attacked and his papers ripped up. The "Winnipeg Free Press" featured a front-page story about the "invasion", describing in great detail the devastation caused by the Nazis in Winnipeg.

<a href="Book%20burning">Books were burned</a> in front of the main <a href="Carnegie%20library">Carnegie</a> branch of the <a href="Winnipeg%20Public%20Library">Winnipeg Public Library</a> (the books had been pre-selected for incineration as damaged or outdated). Soldiers entered the cafeteria at <a href="Great%20West%20Life">Great West Life</a> and stole lunches from workers. They seized <a href="buffalo%20coat">buffalo coat</a>s from the police station and wore them throughout the day, as the temperature was below . At one local elementary school, the principal was arrested and replaced with a 'Nazi' educator dedicated to teaching the "Nazi Truth"; special lessons were prepared for high-school students throughout the city. Some stores and homes were looted by the fake troops. Canadian currency was replaced with fake German <a href="Reichsmark">Reichsmark</a>s, the only propaganda notes that Canada created during the war.
The day ended at 5:30 pm with a ceremonial release of prisoners, a parade, and speeches from the released dignitaries. Members of the organizing committee and local businesspeople marched down Portage Avenue with banners reading "It MUST Not Happen Here!" and "Buy Victory Bonds". Following the parade, a banquet was held at the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> building. Ambassador de Morgenstierne spoke about his experiences with If Day and in Norway, suggesting that the "make-believe Nazi occupation of [Winnipeg] was an authentic glimpse of German behavior in German-ridden Europe".

Surrounding towns were also affected by the invasion: for example, in <a href="Neepawa">Neepawa</a> 'Nazi' soldiers confronted citizens in the streets. <a href="Virden%2C%20Manitoba">Virden</a> was renamed "Virdenberg". A mock attack was planned for strategic targets in <a href="Brandon%2C%20Manitoba">Brandon</a>. The <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> broadcast a program called "Swastika over Canada" on the radio throughout the province, along with military music and extracts of Hitler's speeches.

The If Day event not only resulted in Victory Bond sales well over Greater Winnipeg's goal, but brought Winnipeg's innovative efforts to the attention of people throughout North America. "<a href="Life%20Magazine">Life Magazine</a>" ran a pictorial spread of the If Day activities in Winnipeg and in smaller centres across Manitoba, photographed by William Shrout. Reporters from several American publications, including "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>", "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>", were also present for the event; cameraman <a href="Lucien%20Roy">Lucien Roy</a> shot newsreel footage for <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a>. Newspapers as far away as New Zealand included stories about the event. An estimated 40 million people worldwide saw coverage of If Day.

The money raised for the Victory Loan campaign on If Day was $3.2 million, which was the city's largest single-day total. Winnipeg passed its $24 million Victory Loan quota on 24 February, largely because of the effects of If Day. The provincial total for the entire campaign was $60 million, well above its target quota of $45 million. The campaign raised approximately $2 billion nationwide for the war effort, and If Day was considered one of the most successful fundraising events of the nationwide drive. Officials had expected a significant increase in army recruits as a result of the event, but it failed to end the long-term decline in recruitment numbers: 23 people enlisted at the Winnipeg recruitment office on If Day, compared to an average of 36 per day for the first half of February.

If Day was successful enough to spark imitations in other communities. The US government contacted the organizing committee for details of the event. A smaller-scale invasion was staged in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, using promotional materials from the Winnipeg campaign.

In 2006, a television documentary of the events was made by <a href="Aaron%20Floresco">Aaron Floresco</a> for <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a>'s local series "Manitoba Moments". The work incorporates newsreel footage from the event, as well as interviews with historians and participants. Filmmaker <a href="Guy%20Maddin">Guy Maddin</a> included a brief newsreel clip of If Day in his film "<a href="My%20Winnipeg">My Winnipeg</a>".

Oviri

Oviri (<a href="Tahitian%20language">Tahitian</a> for savage or wild) is an 1894 <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> sculpture by the French artist <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>. In <a href="Tahiti%20and%20Society%20Islands%20mythology">Tahitian mythology</a>, Oviri was the goddess of mourning. She is shown with long pale hair, and wild eyes, smothering a wolf with her feet, while clutching a cub in her arms. Art historians have presented multiple interpretations—usually that Gauguin intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self-image as a "civilised savage". Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894, yet Gauguin romanticises the island's past as he reaches towards more ancient sources, including an <a href="Assyrian%20relief">Assyrian relief</a> of a "<a href="master%20of%20animals">master of animals</a>" type, and <a href="Majapahit">Majapahit</a> mummies. Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the <a href="Marquesas%20Islands">Marquesas Islands</a>, figures found at <a href="Borobudur">Borobudur</a>, and a 9th-century <a href="Mahayana%20Buddhist">Mahayana Buddhist</a> temple in <a href="central%20Java">central Java</a>.

Gauguin made three casts, each in partially glazed <a href="stoneware">stoneware</a>, and while several copies exist in plaster or bronze, the original cast is in the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20d%27Orsay">Musée d'Orsay</a>. His sales of the casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked for one to be placed on his grave. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: he described the figure as a strange and cruel enigma on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> of "Oviri" for <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Stéphane Mallarmé</a>; he referred to it as "La Tueuse" ("The Murderess") in an 1897 letter to <a href="Ambroise%20Vollard">Ambroise Vollard</a>; and he appended an inscription referencing <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a>'s novel "<a href="S%C3%A9raph%C3%AEta">Séraphîta</a>" in a drawing. "Oviri" was exhibited at the 1906 <a href="Salon%20d%27Automne">Salon d'Automne</a> (no. 57) where it influenced <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, who based one of the figures in "<a href="Les%20Demoiselles%20d%27Avignon">Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</a>" on it.

Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist <a href="Ernest%20Chaplet">Ernest Chaplet</a>. They had been introduced by <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Bracquemond">Félix Bracquemond</a> who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at <a href="Rue%20de%20Vaugirard">Vaugirard</a>, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles.
Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of "faaturuma" (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first <a href="wood%20carving">wood carving</a>s in Tahiti were with a <a href="guava">guava</a> wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.

He completed "Oviri" in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20des%20Beaux-Arts">Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts</a> 1895 "salon" opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was "literally expelled" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to <a href="Bengt%20Danielsson">Bengt Danielsson</a>, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to "<a href="Le%20Soir">Le Soir</a>", bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.

At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on "Oviri":
I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the "Tueuse" ("The Murderess"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.

Art historian <a href="Christopher%20Gray">Christopher Gray</a> mentions three plaster casts, the fissured surfaces of which suggest that they were taken from a prior undocumented wood carving no longer extant. One was given to <a href="George-Daniel%20de%20Monfreid">Daniel Monfreid</a> and now belongs to the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20d%C3%A9partemental%20Maurice%20Denis%20%26quot%3BThe%20Priory%26quot%3B">Musée départemental Maurice Denis "The Priory"</a> in <a href="Saint-Germain-en-Laye">Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>. Another version in plaster, with the surface finish of wood, was kept by <a href="Gustave%20Fayet">Gustave Fayet</a>, and subsequently formed part of the collection of his son, Léon. The third version was kept by the artist who made the casts. A number of bronzes were produced, including the version placed on Gauguin's grave at <a href="Atuona">Atuona</a>, cast by the and erected 29 March 1973.

Oviri has long blonde or grey hair reaching to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, while the aperture at the back of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a <a href="Gray%20Wolf">wolf</a> cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the <a href="Medea">vengeful mother</a>, influenced by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a>'s 1838 painting, "<a href="Medea%23Many%20endings">Medea About to Kill Her Children</a>". A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.

The association between the woman and a wolf stems from a remark <a href="Edgar%20Degas">Edgar Degas</a> made defending Gauguin's work at the poorly received 1893 <a href="Durand-Ruel">Durand-Ruel</a> exhibition, when Degas quoted <a href="Jean%20de%20La%20Fontaine">La Fontaine's</a> fable "<a href="The%20Dog%20and%20the%20Wolf">The Dog and the Wolf</a>", which is usually taken as implying that freedom should not be exchanged for comfort or financial gain: "You see, Gauguin is the wolf." In "Oviri", the mature wolf, the European Gauguin, perishes while the whelp, the Gauguin of Tahiti, survives.
The Tahitian myths had largely disappeared by Gauguin's time (he based his own accounts on other sources without acknowledgement), as had most artefacts associated with that culture. His representation of "Oviri" is largely a work of imagination, informed by a collection of what he described as his "little world of friends" and which he took with him to Tahiti on his first visit. These included <a href="Odilon%20Redon">Odilon Redon</a>'s <a href="lithograph">lithograph</a> "La Mort", photographs of subjects such as at <a href="Borobudur">Borobudur</a>, <a href="Java">Java</a>, and an from an 18th dynasty tomb at <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a>. Other sources that have been suggested include an <a href="Dur-Sharrukin">Assyrian</a> relief of <a href="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> clutching a lion cub now in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, and a <a href="Majapahit%20Terracotta">Majapahit terracotta</a> figure from the <a href="Jakarta%20History%20Museum">Djakarta museum</a>.

Oviri's head seems based on mummified skulls of chieftains in the <a href="Marquesas%20Islands">Marquesas Islands</a>, whose eye sockets were traditionally encrusted with mother-of-pearl and worshiped as divine. Elements of her body may draw from <a href="Borobudur">Borobudur</a> images of <a href="fecundity">fecundity</a>. Thus life and death were evoked in the same image. In a letter to Mallarmé trying to raise a public subscription to purchase the work, Morice titled the sculpture "Diane Chasseresse" ("Diana the Huntress"), an allusion to the ancient Greek goddess <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a> of the hunt, moon and childbirth. He made the same reference in his poems on "Oviri". Barbara Landy interprets the life and death theme as indicating Gauguin's need to abandon his civilised ego in a return to the natural state of the primitive savage. The work is related to the 1889 ceramic "Black Venus", which shows a woman kneeling over a severed head resembling the artist.

<a href="Nancy%20Mowll%20Mathews">Nancy Mowll Mathews</a> believes the creatures in her arms and at her feet are actually foxes, animals Gauguin had used in his 1889 wood carving "Be in Love, You Will Be Happy" and in his 1891 Pont-Aven oil painting "The Loss of Virginity". In an 1889 letter to <a href="%C3%89mile%20Bernard%20%28painter%29">Émile Bernard</a>, he described the "<a href="Soyez%20amoureuses%20vous%20serez%20heureuses">Soyez amoureuses</a>" fox as an "Indian symbol of perversity". There is a long tradition in Asian folklore of foxes having the power to transform into women (for example in Japanese "<a href="Y%C5%8Dkai">Yōkai</a>" or "<a href="Kitsune">Kitsune</a>" folklore).

Gauguin depicts the "Oviri" figure in at least one drawing, two watercolour transfer <a href="monotype">monotype</a>s and two woodcuts. It is possible that the woodcuts were created in Pont-Aven in the summer of 1894; before the ceramic. The last to appear is probably the drawing in what is apparently the first issue of Gauguin's <a href="Papeete">Papeete</a> broadsheet "<a href="Le%20Sourire">Le Sourire</a>" "(The Smile: A Serious Newspaper)" published between August 1899 and April 1900. It was accompanied by the inscription "Et le monstre, entraînant sa créature, féconde de sa semence des flancs généreux pour engendrer Séraphitus-Séraphita" ("And the monster, embracing its creation, filled her generous womb with seed and fathered Séraphitus-Séraphita"). Séraphitus-Séraphita is an allusion to <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac's</a> novel "<a href="S%C3%A9raph%C3%AEta">Séraphîta</a>" which features an <a href="androgynous">androgynous</a> hero. In this first issue of "Le Sourire", he reviewed a local <a href="Maohi">Maohi</a> author's play by that dealt with incest (among other themes), and invokes 'Séraphitus-Séraphita'. The review congratulated the play's "savage author" and ended with a plea for women's liberation through the abolition of marriage. The accompanying drawing is distinctly androgynous.

Art historians have put forward various theories as to the seeming multiplicity of meanings inherent in Gauguin's representation. Most obviously the figure invokes Tahitian legend and themes of death and superstition. It reflects the artist's view of female sexuality; a common motif in 19th century art was the connection between long, wild hair and evil femininity. Related is the delight Gauguin took from its alternative title "savage" and the implications of a brutal, bloodthirsty deity, which seems to refer as much to himself as the goddess.

Gauguin's figure invokes the Polynesian goddess <a href="Hina%20%28goddess%29%23Tuamotu%20and%20Tahiti">Hina</a>, depicted by Morice as a <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana-like</a> deity clutching a wolf cub, "monstrous and majestic, drunk with pride, rage and sorrow". He titled an 1894 self-portrait in plaster as "Oviri". The original is lost but a number of bronze casts survive. He used double mirrors to capture his familiar Inca profile, the result reprising his "<a href="Jug%20in%20the%20Form%20of%20a%20Head%2C%20Self-Portrait">Jug in the Form of a Head, Self-Portrait</a>". This was one of the earliest occasions Gauguin applied the term "Oviri" to himself. "Gauguin sometimes also referred to himself as Oviri, the savage ...", writes . The Stuttgart version of his 1892 oil painting "<a href="Where%20Do%20We%20Come%20From%3F%20What%20Are%20We%3F%20Where%20Are%20We%20Going%3F">E haere oe i hia (Where Are You Going?)</a>" depicts a woman clutching a wolf cub. Pollitt remarks that this stocky, sculptural and androgynous figure gives a first glimpse of "Oviri".

"Oviri" was the title of a favourite Tahitian song—a melancholy tune of love and longing that mentions the subject's "savage, restless heart". It recounts the love between two women for each other, both of whom have grown silent and cold. Gauguin translated the verse in his series of romanticised journal "<a href="Noa%20Noa">Noa Noa</a>" (Tahitian for "fragrance", a written project he undertook to examine his Tahitian experience, which he accompanied with a series of ten woodcuts); the only one of his songs reprinted in the Tahitian newspaper "La Guêpes" when he became editor. Danielsson believes the song echoes Gauguin's dual attachment to his Danish wife Mette and his then "vahine" (Tahitian for "woman") <a href="Merahi%20metua%20no%20Tehamana">Teha'amana</a>, his young native wife and the focal point of "Noa Noa".

"Noa Noa" contains an account of a journey into the mountains with a young man whom he eventually understands as sexless, leading him to meditate on the "androgynous side of the savage" in his manuscript. Ben Pollitt notes that in Tahitian culture the craftsman/artist, neither warrior/hunter nor homemaker/carer, was conceived androgynously, an ambiguous gender position that appealed to Gauguin's subversive nature. Taylor believes Morice may have been describing Gauguin in his 1897 poem "Shining Hina of the Woods" as part of two long extracts from their collaboration on "Noa Noa". Gray views the sculpture as representing "the expression of Gauguin's profound disillusionment and discouragement".

"Noa Noa" is part of Gauguin's documentation of his experiences as a colonial visitor to Tahiti in 1891–1893. He first used the term "Noa Noa" to describe the scent of Tahitian women: "A mingled perfume, half animal, half vegetable emanated from them; the perfume of their blood and of the <a href="gardenia%20taitensis">gardenia taitensis</a>, which they wore in their hair". On his return to Paris in 1893, Gauguin was apprehensive about exhibiting his Tahitian works. "Noa Noa" was to provide the context necessary for the public to comprehend the new motifs presented at his Durand-Ruel exhibition. It was not completed in time for the opening of the exhibition.

Gauguin asked that "Oviri" be placed on his grave, which seems to indicate that he saw the figure as his "alter ego". According to Mathews, he saw the fox as changeable in its gender as he was, and thus symbolic of dangerous sexuality. A number of sources indicate that Gauguin was suffering a syphilitic rash that prevented him from travelling to Tahiti for several months. She suggests the orifice is a "<a href="pars%20pro%20toto">pars pro toto</a>" for the woman who infected him.

The anthropologist believes "Oviri" was intended as an <a href="epithet">epithet</a> to reinforce Gauguin's "persona" as a "civilised savage". In his final letter to Morice, the artist wrote that ""You" were wrong that day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work there is nothing that can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable."

Whether or not the sculpture was to be exhibited at the "<a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20des%20Beaux-Arts">Salon de la Nationale</a>", it was scheduled for the café proprietor Lévy at 57 rue Saint-Lazare, with whom Gauguin had concluded an agreement to represent him before his last departure for Tahiti. It failed to sell, and Charles Morice was unable to raise public money to acquire it for the nation. Gauguin had thought his only likely interested patron would be <a href="Gustave%20Fayet">Gustave Fayet</a>, who did eventually buy it for 1,500 francs, but in 1905, after Gauguin's death.

Gauguin was celebrated by the Parisian <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> after the posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the <a href="Salon%20d%27Automne">Salon d'Automne</a> in 1903 and 1906. The power evoked by his work led directly to "<a href="Les%20Demoiselles%20d%27Avignon">Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</a>" in 1907. According to <a href="David%20Sweetman">David Sweetman</a>, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist in Paris. Durrio was a friend of Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.

Art historian <a href="John%20Richardson%20%28art%20historian%29">John Richardson</a> writes:
The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy.

Both Sweetman and Richardson point to the Gauguin "Oviri" as a major influence. First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was probably a direct influence on "Les Demoiselles". <a href="David%20Sweetman">David Sweetman</a> writes, "Gauguin's statue "Oviri," which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in printmaking, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"."

In 2006, a bronze version of "Oviri" sold at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> New York for US$251,200.

The Author's Farce

The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town is a play by the English playwright and novelist <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>, first performed on 30 March 1730 at the <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">Little Theatre, Haymarket</a>. Written in response to the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal</a>'s rejection of his earlier plays, "The Author's Farce" was Fielding's first theatrical success. The Little Theatre allowed Fielding the freedom to experiment, and to alter the traditional comedy genre. The play ran during the early 1730s and was altered for its run starting 21 April 1730 and again in response to the <a href="Actor%20Rebellion%20of%201733">Actor Rebellion of 1733</a>. Throughout its life, the play was coupled with several different plays, including "The Cheats of Scapin" and Fielding's "<a href="Tom%20Thumb%20%28play%29">Tom Thumb</a>".

The first and second acts deal with the attempts of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a <a href="puppet%20theatre">puppet theatre</a> play titled "The Pleasures of the Town", about the Goddess Nonsense's choice of a husband from <a href="allegorical">allegorical</a> representatives of theatre and other <a href="literary%20genre">literary genre</a>s. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a <a href="Story%20within%20a%20story%23Play%20within%20a%20play">play within a play</a>, in which the characters in the puppet play are portrayed by humans. "The Author's Farce" ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities.

The play established Fielding as a popular London playwright, and the press reported that seats were in great demand. Although largely ignored by critics until the 20th century, most agree that the play is primarily a commentary on events in Fielding's life, signalling his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries. Fielding's play within a play satirised the way in which the London theatre scene, in his view, abused the literary public by offering new and inferior genres. "The Author's Farce" is now considered to be a critical success and a highly skilled satire.

Most of Fielding's plays were written in five acts, but "The Author's Farce" was written in three. The opening introduces the main character, Harry Luckless, and his attempts to woo Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood. The play begins in much the same way as Fielding's earlier romance-themed comedies, but quickly becomes a different type of play, mocking the literary and theatrical establishment. Luckless is trying to become a successful writer, but lacks the income that would allow him to concentrate on his writing. Although others try to support him financially, Luckless refuses their help; when his friend, Witmore, pays his rent behind his back, Luckless steals the money from Mrs. Moneywood. In the second act, Luckless seeks assistance to help finish his play, "The Pleasures of the Town", but is poorly advised, and the work is rejected by his local theatre. Luckless revises his play and succeeds in finding an alternative venue, leading to the third act, in which the work is performed as a puppet show, with actors taking the place of the puppets.

The third act is dominated by the puppet show, a play within the play. It begins when the Goddess of Nonsense chooses a mate from a series of suitors along the <a href="Styx">River Styx</a>. All dunces, the suitors include Dr. Orator, Sir Farcical Comic, Mrs. Novel, Bookseller, Poet, Monsieur Pantomime, Don Tragedio and Signior Opera. The goddess eventually chooses a foreign <a href="castrato">castrato</a> opera singer as her favourite — Signior Opera — after he sings an aria about money. Mrs. Novel then claims that she loved Signior Opera, and died giving birth to his child. At this revelation, the goddess becomes upset, but is quick to forgive. The play within the play is interrupted by Constable and Murdertext, who arrive to arrest Luckless "for abusing Nonsense", but Mrs. Novel persuades Murdertext to let the play finish. Someone from the land of <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Banten">Bantam</a> then arrives to tell Luckless that he is the prince of Bantam. News follows that the King of Bantam has died, and that Luckless is to be made the new king. The play concludes with the revelation that Luckless's landlady is in reality the Queen of "Old <a href="Brentford">Brentford</a>" and that her daughter, Harriot, is now royalty. An epilogue in which four poets discuss how the play should end is brought to a conclusion by a cat, in the form of a woman.

Fielding uses Luckless and "The Author's Farce" to portray aspects of his life, including his experience with the London theatre community. The plot serves as revenge for the Theatre Royal's rejection of <a href="Henry%20Fielding%27s%20early%20plays%231727%E2%80%931728">Fielding's earlier plays</a>. However, this and his being forced into minor theatres proved beneficial, because it allowed him more freedom to experiment with his plays in ways that would have been unacceptable at larger locations. This experimentation, beginning with "The Author's Farce", is an attempt by Fielding to try writing in formats beyond the standard five-act comedy play. Though he returned to writing five-act plays later, many of his plays contain plot structures that differ from those common to contemporary plays. To distinguish his satirical intent, Fielding claims that the work was written by "Scriblerus Secundus," which places his play within an earlier literary tradition. The name refers to the <a href="Scriblerus%20Club">Scriblerus Club</a>, a satirical group whose members included <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>, <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>, <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a>, and <a href="John%20Arbuthnot">John Arbuthnot</a>. Fielding's use of the pseudonym connects his play to the satirical writings of the Scriblerus Club's members, and reveals their influence on his new style, such as incorporating in their work the styles of the entertainments that they were ridiculing. Fielding thus allows the audience to believe that he is poking fun at others, less discriminating than themselves, and less able to distinguish good art from bad. Fielding also borrowed characters from the work of the Club's members, such as the Goddess of Nonsense, influenced by Pope's character from "<a href="The%20Dunciad">The Dunciad</a>", <a href="Dulness">Dulness</a>, who is at war with reason. Nonsense, like Dulness, is a force that promotes the corruption of literature and taste, to which Fielding adds a sexual element. This sexuality is complicated, yet also made comical, when Nonsense chooses a castrated man as her mate. Her choice emphasises a lack of morality, one of the problems that Fielding believed dominated 18th-century British society. Despite the link to Dulness, the general satire of the play more closely resembles Gay's "<a href="Beggar%27s%20Opera">Beggar's Opera</a>" than the other works produced by the Scriblerus Club.

"The Author's Farce" is not a standard comedy; rather, it is a <a href="farce">farce</a>, and as such employs petty forms of humour like slapstick. Instead of relying on rhetorical wit, Fielding incorporates dramatic incongruities. For example, actors play puppets in a life-size version of a puppet play. Fielding's purpose in relying on the farce tradition was specifically to criticise society as a whole. Like others, Fielding believed that there was a decline in popular theatre related to the expansion of its audience, therefore he satirises it, its audiences, and its writers throughout "The Author's Farce". Speaking of popular entertainment in London, Fielding's character Luckless claims, "If you must write, write nonsense, write operas, write entertainments, write "Hurlothrumbos", set up an "Oratory" and preach nonsense, and you may meet with encouragement enough." Luckless's only ambition is to become successful. Many of the characters in the play believe that the substance of a play matters little as long as it can earn a profit. Harriot believes that the only important characteristic of a lover is his merit, which, to her, is his ability to become financially successful. Fielding later continues this line of attacks on audiences, morality, and genres when he criticises <a href="Samuel%20Richardson">Samuel Richardson</a>'s <a href="epistolary%20novel">epistolary novel</a> "<a href="Pamela%2C%20or%20Virtue%20Rewarded">Pamela</a>", in which a nobleman makes advances upon a servant-maid with the intent of making her his mistress.

The blending of the fictional and real worlds at the end of the play represents the inability of individuals to distinguish between fictional and real experience. The final act of the play also serves as Fielding's defence of traditional hierarchical views of literature. He satirises new literary genres with low standards by using personified versions of them during the puppet show. In particular, Fielding mocks how contemporary audiences favoured Italian opera, a dramatic form that he regarded with contempt. Fielding considered it "a foreign intruder that has weaned the public from their native entertainments". The character Signior Opera, the image of the favoured castrato singer within the puppet show, is a parody of the foreigners who performed as singers, along with the audiences that accepted them. Additionally, the character serves as a source of humour that targets 18th-century literary genres; after the character Nonsense chooses the castrato Signior Opera as her husband, Mrs Novel objects, declaring that she gave birth to his child. This act would be physically impossible because Opera is a castrato, and it pokes fun at how the genres and the public treated such individuals. Fielding was not alone in using the castrato image for humour and satire; <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a> connects the castrato singer with politics and social problems, and many other contemporary works mock women who favour eunuchs.

Many aspects of the play are drawn from Fielding's own experiences. During Act II, the characters Marplay and Sparkish, two theatre managers, offer poor advice to Luckless on how to improve his play, which they then reject. This fictional event mirrors Fielding's own life when <a href="Colley%20Cibber">Colley Cibber</a> and <a href="Robert%20Wilks">Robert Wilks</a> of the Theatre Royal rejected "<a href="The%20Temple%20Beau">The Temple Beau</a>". Cibber was an inspiration for the character of Marplay and Wilks for Sparkish, but Sparkish does not appear in the revised version of 1734, after Wilks's death. In his place Fielding introduces a character who mocks <a href="Theophilus%20Cibber">Theophilus Cibber</a>, Colley's son, and his role in the <a href="Actor%20Rebellion%20of%201733">Actor Rebellion of 1733</a>. Another biographical parallel involves the relationship between Luckless and Mrs Moneywood, which is similar to Fielding's own relationship with Jan Oson, his landlord during his stay in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a> in early 1729. There Fielding incurred a debt of about £13 (equivalent to about £1,760 as of 2008), and a legal case was brought against him. Abandoning his personal property, Fielding fled to London; Oson's seizure of Fielding's possessions mirrors Mrs Moneywood's threats to seize those belonging to Luckless. Other characters are modelled on well-known personalities of whom Fielding was aware though they were not personal acquaintances:: Mrs Novel is <a href="Eliza%20Haywood">Eliza Haywood</a>, a writer, actress, and publisher; Signior Opera is <a href="Senesino">Senesino</a>, a famous Italian <a href="contralto">contralto</a> <a href="castrato">castrato</a>; Bookweight is similar to <a href="Edmund%20Curll">Edmund Curll</a>, a bookseller and publisher known for unscrupulous publication and publicity; Orator is <a href="John%20Henley%20%28clergyman%29">John Henley</a>, a clergyman, entertainer, and well-known orator; Monsieur Pantomime is <a href="John%20Rich%20%28producer%29">John Rich</a>, a director and theatre manager; and Don Tragedio is <a href="Lewis%20Theobald">Lewis Theobald</a>, an editor and author. Sir Farcical Comick is another version of Colley Cibber, but only in his role as an entertainer.

Fielding drew inspiration from many literary sources and traditions as well as from his own life. The structure and plot of "The Author's Farce" are similar to those of <a href="George%20Farquhar">George Farquhar</a>'s "Love and a Bottle" (1698), in that both plays describe the relationship between an author and his landlady. The plays only deal with the same generalised idea however; the particulars of each are different. Fielding also drew on the Scriblerus Club's use of satire and the humour common to traditional <a href="Restoration%20drama">Restoration</a> and <a href="Augustan%20drama">Augustan drama</a>. Many of Luckless's situations are similar to those found within various traditional British dramas, including <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Buckingham</a>'s "<a href="The%20Rehearsal%20%28play%29">The Rehearsal</a>" (1672), a satirical play about staging a play. It is possible that Pope's "<a href="Dunciad">Dunciad Variorum</a>", published on 13 March 1729, influenced the themes of the play and the plot of the puppet show. The Court of Nonsense in the puppet show are related to the Court of Dulness in "The Dunciad" and the Court of Nonsense in <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>'s "<a href="Mac%20Flecknoe">Mac Flecknoe</a>". The Scriblerus Club style of humour as a whole influences "The Author's Farce", and it is possible that Fielding borrowed from Gay's "<a href="Three%20Hours%20after%20Marriage">Three Hours after Marriage</a>" (1717) and "The Beggar's Opera" (1728). In turn, Fielding's play influenced later Scriblerus Club works, especially Pope's fourth book of his revised "Dunciad" and possibly Gay's "The Rehearsal at Goatham".

"The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town" was written during 1729. The first press announcement of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the "<a href="Daily%20Post%20%28London%20newspaper%29">Daily Post</a>", stating that it was in rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play was expected to be a popular entertainment. It opened on Easter Monday, 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside "The Cheats of Scapin". The last act was later made into the companion piece to "<a href="Hurlothrumbo">Hurlothrumbo</a>" for one show.

Fielding altered and rewrote "The Author's Farce" for its second run beginning on 21 April 1730, when it shared the bill with his earlier play "<a href="Tom%20Thumb%20%28play%29">Tom Thumb</a>". This combination continued through May and June and was later billed for a revival on 3 July 1730. Starting on 1 August 1730, the third act of "The Author's Farce" was revived by the Little Theatre during the week of the <a href="Tottenham%20Court%20Road">Tottenham Court</a> fair. On 17 October 1730 an advertisement in the "Daily Post" announced that a new prologue was to be added. A version without the prologue followed before the play's run ended, to be replaced by "The Beggar's Wedding" by <a href="Charles%20Coffey">Charles Coffey</a>. "The Author's Farce" was briefly revived in November 1730 and January 1731, but only the first two acts of the play were shown. It was paired with the <a href="afterpiece">afterpiece</a> "Damon and Phillida", which was later replaced by "The Jealous Taylor" in January 1731. Performances continued into February and March 1731. Productions in 1732 included a new prologue, now lost, that had been added for the 10 May 1731 performance.

On 31 March 1731, "The Author's Farce" was paired with the "Tom Thumb" remake, "<a href="The%20Tragedy%20of%20Tragedies">The Tragedy of Tragedies</a>", as a replacement for "<a href="The%20Letter%20Writers">The Letter Writers</a>", the original companion piece. Although both "Tragedy of Tragedies" and "The Author's Farce" were main shows, they alternated on the billing until the 18 June 1731 performance, the final showing of any Fielding play in the Little Theatre except for a 12 May 1732 benefit show of "The Author's Farce". The last documented non-puppet version was performed on 28 March 1748 by Theophilus Cibber as a two-act companion piece for a benefit show. The "Pleasures of the Town" act was performed as a one-act play outside London throughout the century, including a 15-show run at Norwich in 1749 and during the 1750s, and a production at York during the 1751–52 theatre season. Additionally, there were benefit shows that included the third act at a variety of locations, including Dublin, on 19 December 1763 and Edinburgh in 1763. There were also many performances of the puppet theatre versions, including a travelling show by Thomas Yeates, titled "Punch's Oratory, or The Pleasures of the Town", which started in 1734.

In response to the <a href="Actor%20Rebellion%20of%201733">Actor Rebellion of 1733</a>, Fielding produced a revised version of "The Author's Farce", incorporating a new prologue and epilogue. Performed at the Theatre Royal, it was advertised in the "Daily Journal", opening with an inferior replacement cast for some of the important characters. It was joined by "The Intriguing Chambermaid" and "The Harlot's Progress". These were the only performances of the revised version, which was printed together with "The Intriguing Chambermade" (1734) and included a letter by an unknown writer, possibly Fielding himself. The 1734 edition of the play was printed in 1750, and it was used for all later publications until 1966. Printed texts of the play were included in <a href="Arthur%20Murphy%20%28writer%29">Arthur Murphy</a>'s 1762 "Works of Henry Fielding" and <a href="George%20Saintsbury">George Saintsbury</a>'s 1893 "Works of Henry Fielding". The latter includes "The Author's Farce" along with only two other plays. The 1903 "Works of Henry Fielding", edited by G. H. Maynadier, included only the first two acts. Only three scenes were included in Alfred Howard's "The Beauties of Fielding", which collected passages from Fielding's works. George Saintsbury included "The Author's Farce" and two other plays in a Fielding collected edition of 1893, but ignored the others.

The success of "The Author's Farce" established Fielding as a London playwright; writing in 1998, Harold Pagliaro describes the play as Fielding's "first great success". Catherine Ingrassia, in 2004, attributes its popularity to Fielding's satirical attack on the archetypal woman writer, specifically Haywood. Among contemporary accounts the "Daily Post" of 2 May 1730 reported that the play received universal approval, and on 6 May that seats were in great demand. The 7 May issue of the "<a href="Grub%20Street%20Journal">Grub Street Journal</a>" noted that the play was popular among "Persons of Quality"; many notable figures attended the show, including on the first night <a href="John%20Perceval%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Egmont">John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont</a>, and <a href="Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Frederick, Prince of Wales</a>, whose presence was mentioned in the 28 April 1730 "London Evening Post" and the 15 May 1730 "Daily Post". The only surviving comments from any of those who saw the play come from the diary of the Earl of Egmont, who reported that "The Author's Farce" and "Tom Thumb" "are a ridicule on poets, several of their works, as also of operas, etc., and the last of our modern tragedians, and are exceedingly full of humour, with some wit."

The play was hardly discussed at all during the 18th century, and the 19th century mostly followed the same trend. A chapter on the play is included in Frederick Lawrence's "Life of Fielding" (1855), and it is mentioned by <a href="Leslie%20Stephen">Leslie Stephen</a> and <a href="Henry%20Austin%20Dobson">Austin Dobson</a>, who focus on what the play says about Grub Street and Fielding. Most later critics agree with Dobson's judgement that the play primarily provides a commentary on events in Fielding's life, and marks his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries. Charles Woods, writing in 1966, argues that "The Author's Farce" was an integral part of Fielding's career, and dismisses a political reading of the work. Some years earlier, in 1918, <a href="Wilbur%20Lucius%20Cross">Wilbur Lucius Cross</a> had held that the play revealed Fielding's talent for writing farces and <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a>s. Writing in 1993, Martin and Ruthe Battestin maintain that the play "was [Fielding's] first experiment in the irregular comic modes ... where his true genius as a playwright at last found scope". They further assert that Fielding was the first to offer audiences "a kind of pointed, inventive foolery", and that his talent for "ridicule and brisk dialogue" and for devising "absurd yet expressionistic plots" was unmatched even in 20th-century theatre. Earlier, <a href="Frederick%20Homes%20Dudden">Frederick Homes Dudden</a>, had described the puppet show in the third act as "a highly original satire on the theatrical and quasi-theatrical amusements of the day." <a href="F.%20W.%20Bateson">F. W. Bateson</a> included the play in his 1963 list of "satirical extravaganzas".

J. Paul Hunter, in his 1975 comparison of Fielding's theatrical style and form, notes that while "many of the literary and theatrical jibes are witty," the slow pacing and lack of dramatic conflict make the play seem "essentially untheatrical". Pat Rogers disagrees, reasoning that "Few livelier theatrical occasions can ever have been seen than the original runs of "The Author's Farce", with their mixture of broad comedy, personal satire, tuneful scenes and rapid action." Robert Hume, in 1988, comments that the literary structure of "The Author's Farce" is "ramshackle but effective", although he considers that "Fielding's parody of recognition scenes is done with verve" and "the 'realistic' part of the show is a clever combination of the straightforward and the ironic." Writing in 1998, Thomas Lockwood explains various aspects that make the play great, putting particular emphasis on the "musical third act", which he believes "shows a gift for brilliant theatrical arrangement". Lockwood praises the play's conclusion in particular, and the ever-increasing tempo of events following Murdertext's "explosive invasion".

Jersey Act

The Jersey Act was introduced to prevent the registration of most American-bred <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> horses in the British "<a href="General%20Stud%20Book">General Stud Book</a>". It had its roots in the desire of the British to halt the influx of American-bred <a href="horse%20racing">racehorse</a>s of possibly impure bloodlines during the early 20th century. Many American-bred horses were exported to Europe to race and retire to a <a href="horse%20breeding">breeding</a> career after a number of US states <a href="Gambling%20in%20the%20United%20States%23History">banned gambling</a>, which depressed Thoroughbred racing as well as breeding in the United States. The loss of breeding records during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and the late beginning of the registration of American Thoroughbreds led many in the <a href="Horse%20racing%20in%20Great%20Britain">British racing</a> establishment to doubt that the American-bred horses were purebred.

In 1913, the <a href="Jockey%20Club">Jockey Club</a> and the owners of the "General Stud Book" passed a regulation named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, <a href="Victor%20Child%20Villiers%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Jersey">Lord Jersey</a>, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.

Before the introduction in 1913 of what became popularly known—"with questionnable taste" according to a correspondent writing in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"—as the Jersey Act, Thoroughbred horses in the United Kingdom were registered in the "General Stud Book", the <a href="Breed%20registry">stud book</a> for British and Irish Thoroughbreds. The rules allowed a horse to be registered if all of the horse's ancestors were registered in the "General Stud Book" or if it had been bred outside of Britain or Ireland and was registered in the stud book of its country of origin. Overall the "General Stud Book" had the most stringent rules for registration of Thoroughbreds at the time, around 1900; other countries, including the United States, France, Australia and Russia, were considered by the British and Irish to be much laxer and to have allowed some non-Thoroughbred horses into their national stud books.

The <a href="Gambling%20in%20the%20United%20States%23History">outlawing of race-track betting</a> in parts of the United States between 1900 and 1913 led to a large influx of American-bred horses into Britain and Ireland, giving rise to fears among British breeders that they would be swamped by the American bloodlines and their own stock would become worthless. The biggest state to outlaw betting was New York, which passed the <a href="Hart%E2%80%93Agnew%20Law">Hart–Agnew Law</a> in 1908. By 1911, the average price for <a href="Yearling%20%28horse%29">yearlings</a> sold at auction was at a record low of $230 ($ as of 2019). Before 1900, most horses were imported into Britain to race, and rarely stayed for a breeding career. The outlawing of gambling resulted in large numbers of American horses that could no longer be supported, and many were shipped to Europe for racing. Because of the downturn in the horse market in the US, it was assumed that most of the horses sent to Europe would stay there permanently and, after retirement from the racetrack, would enter their breeding careers outside the US. Between 1908 and 1913, over 1500 Thoroughbreds were exported from the United States. Those exported included 24 horses who had been or would later become champions – among them <a href="Artful">Artful</a>, <a href="Colin%20%28horse%29">Colin</a>, <a href="Henry%20of%20Navarre%20%28horse%29">Henry of Navarre</a>, <a href="Peter%20Pan%20I">Peter Pan</a>, and <a href="Ballot%20%28horse%29">Ballot</a>.

The "<a href="American%20Stud%20Book">American Stud Book</a>", the registration book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much later than the "General Stud Book", and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the "American Stud Book" or other national stud books, unlike the "General Stud Book" rules. In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the "General Stud Book" rules. Adding to the problem was the fact that American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with <a href="Iroquois%20%28horse%29">Iroquois</a>, who won the 1881 <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a>.

<a href="James%20Ben%20Ali%20Haggin">J. B. Haggin</a>, an American breeder and owner of <a href="Elmendorf%20Farm">Elmendorf Farm</a>, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, including the <a href="1908%20Grand%20National">1908</a> <a href="Grand%20National">Grand National</a> steeplechase winner <a href="Rubio%20%28horse%29">Rubio</a>, and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began to limit the number of training licences at <a href="Newmarket%20Racecourse">Newmarket Racecourse</a>, turning away a number of American breeders. The "General Stud Book" rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the "General Stud Book", but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered.

The owners of the "General Stud Book", <a href="Weatherbys">Weatherbys</a>, consulted with the Jockey Club, the United Kingdom's racing authority, and discussions were held about the problems in pedigrees recorded in the "American Stud Book". At a meeting of the Jockey Club in spring 1913, <a href="Victor%20Child%20Villiers%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Jersey">Victor Child Villiers, Lord Jersey</a>, the club's senior steward, proposed a resolution limiting the registration of American bloodlines. It passed unanimously in May, and a new regulation was placed in the "General Stud Book", Volume 22:
Although named the Jersey Act by a critical foreign press, after Lord Jersey, the new regulation did not have the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse, not by the United Kingdom government. Nor was it promulgated by the Jockey Club, which had no authority over registration, only over racing matters. The regulation required that any horse registered in the "General Stud Book" trace in every line to a horse that had already been registered in the "General Stud Book", effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.

The new rule was not applied retroactively, therefore all American-bred horses registered before 1913 remained on the register, and their descendants were also eligible for registration. Of the 7,756 mares in Volume 27 of the "General Stud Book", published in 1933, 930 would have been ineligible under the new rule. The Jersey Act did have an immediate impact however, as the winner of the 1914 Epsom Derby, <a href="Durbar%20%28horse%29">Durbar II</a>, was ineligible for registration, as his dam, Armenia, was bred in the United States and was not herself eligible for the "General Stud Book".

The main problem for American breeders was the presence of the blood of <a href="Lexington%20%28horse%29">Lexington</a> in their breeding programs. Lexington's pedigree on his dam's side was suspect in the eyes of British racing authorities, and as he had been the leading sire of racehorses in the United States for 16 years, his descendants were numerous. Most American-bred Thoroughbreds traced to Lexington at least once, and he was not the only horse with suspect bloodlines registered in the "American Stud Book".

Most British breeders thought the regulation necessary and welcomed it, whereas most American breeders found it insulting, and believed that it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market. The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though, including even one senior member of the Jockey Club, <a href="George%20Coventry%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Coventry">Lord Coventry</a>, whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration. Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition, probably owing to the effect of the gambling bans in the United States on the domestic horse market. The American <a href="The%20Jockey%20Club">Jockey Club</a> did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication, the "Racing Calendar", and no mention of it appears in the Jockey Club's meeting minutes for 1913. Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming.

The Jersey Act did not prevent the racing of horses containing the banned bloodlines, as horses with the suspect breeding raced and won in England, but they were considered to be "half-bred". A number of American-bred horses carrying the lines of Lexington had already been imported into England, including <a href="Americus%20%28horse%29">Americus</a>, <a href="Rhoda%20B">Rhoda B</a>, and <a href="Sibola">Sibola</a>, and because they were <a href="grandfather%20clause">grandfathered in</a>, they and their descendants were allowed to be registered in the "General Stud Book". Nor did it prevent the racing of horses that were not registered in the "General Stud Book"; it just prevented registration in the "General Stud Book". American bloodlines, whether registered in the "General Stud Book" or not, dominated English racing in the 1920s and 1930s. Horses that were ineligible for "General Stud Book" registration, but were allowed to race, were identified with a <a href="Maltese%20cross">Maltese cross</a> in programs and auction listings.

A number of American breeders, including the then-chairman of the American Jockey Club, <a href="William%20Woodward%2C%20Sr.">William Woodward, Sr.</a>, lobbied hard throughout the 1930s to have the regulation removed. Woodward, and other defenders of the American bloodlines, argued that the racing performance of the horses proved their purity, even if they could not produce papers that did so. Woodward declared in 1935 that "If we do not get together, we will grow apart." Those arguing for keeping the Jersey Act in effect pointed out that the "General Stud Book" is a record of bloodlines, not a work recording racing ability.

The Jersey Act's major effect was the opposite of what was intended. In the years before the Second World War, British and Irish breeders had relied on imported Thoroughbreds from France to enrich their breeding lines, a source that was unavailable during the war, and concerns were beginning to be expressed that the situation might lead to excessive inbreeding. Additionally, by the end of the war American-bred lines were some of the most successful racing lines in the world, effectively making the British and Irish breeding programmes that did not use them second-rate, and harming the rebuilding of English racing. There were even calls for the creation of an international stud book to record all Thoroughbred pedigrees, thus eliminating any perceived slight on the bloodlines that were excluded from the "General Stud Book".

Weatherbys, publishers of the "Stud Book", approached the Jockey Club in 1948 to ask if it agreed that the Jersey Act was "too restrictive". The rule was subsequently modified in June 1949, after the racing careers of a number of horses such as <a href="Tourbillon%20%28horse%29">Tourbillon</a> and <a href="Djebel">Djebel</a> persuaded the Jockey Club to reconsider. A number of French-bred Thoroughbreds began to race in England after the Second World War, but because they carried American lines they were considered half-breds. In 1948 two of England's five <a href="British%20Classic%20Races">classic races</a> were won by half-bred horses, <a href="My%20Babu">My Babu</a> and <a href="Black%20Tarquin">Black Tarquin</a>, prompting the Jockey Club to amend the rule in the preface to the "General Stud Book", to state that:

The amendment removed the stigma of not being considered purebred from American-bred horses. A major consideration was that by the late 1940s most of the horses with suspect pedigrees were so far back in most horses' ancestry that it no longer made much sense to exclude them. Neither did it make much sense to exclude some of the most successful racehorses in Europe from registration. Weatherby's further amended its regulations in 1969, introducing the word "thoroughbred" to describe the horses registered in previous volumes of the "General Stud Book". In 2006, <a href="Blood-Horse%20Publications">Blood-Horse Publications</a>, publisher of "<a href="The%20Blood-Horse%20magazine">The Blood-Horse</a>" magazine, chose the "repeal" of the Jersey Act as the 39th most important moment in American Thoroughbred horse racing history.

Steve Dodd

Steve Dodd (1 June 1928 – 10 November 2014) was an <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australian</a> actor, notable for playing indigenous characters across seven decades of Australian film. After beginning his working life as a stockman and rodeo rider, Dodd was given his first film roles by prominent Australian actor <a href="Chips%20Rafferty">Chips Rafferty</a>. His career was interrupted by six years in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, and limited by <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecasting</a>.

Dodd performed in several major Australian movies, including "<a href="Gallipoli%20%281981%20film%29">Gallipoli</a>" and "<a href="The%20Chant%20of%20Jimmie%20Blacksmith%20%28film%29">The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith</a>", in which he played Tabidgi, the murdering uncle of the lead character. He also held minor parts in Australia-based international film productions including "<a href="The%20Coca-Cola%20Kid">The Coca-Cola Kid</a>", "<a href="Quigley%20Down%20Under">Quigley Down Under</a>" and "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>". He likewise appeared in minor roles in early Australian television series, such as "<a href="Homicide%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29">Homicide</a>" and "<a href="Rush%20%281970s%20TV%20series%29">Rush</a>", as well as later series including "<a href="The%20Flying%20Doctors">The Flying Doctors</a>". In 2013, Dodd was honoured with the Jimmy Little Lifetime Achievement Award at the 19th <a href="Deadly%20Awards">Deadly Awards</a> at the <a href="Sydney%20Opera%20House">Sydney Opera House</a>. He died in November 2014.

Dodd, also known as Mullawa or Mulla walla (flying fish), was an <a href="Arrernte%20people">Arunta or Arrente</a> Indigenous man from central Australia. It is unclear if Dodd was from the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> or <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>: one source states he was born in <a href="Alice%20Springs%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Alice Springs</a>, and another states he was born at the <a href="Hermannsburg%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Hermannsburg Mission</a>, to the town's south-west. However a third source suggests <a href="Oodnadatta%2C%20South%20Australia">Oodnadatta</a>, across the border in South Australia, while Dodd himself, in a 2011 interview, stated he was South Australian. A 1953 newspaper report states that he was from <a href="Coober%20Pedy">Coober Pedy</a> and had been resident at Colebrook Home, which housed Indigenous children from northern South Australia; some residents subsequently identified as members of the <a href="Stolen%20Generation">Stolen Generation</a>. The only record of a birth date is in the Department of Veterans' Affairs' "Nominal Roll of Australian Veterans of the Korean War", which gives 1 June 1928.

In 1966 he was reported to be a bachelor; later sources shed no light on his marital status. In 1971 he remarked in an interview that his father and six brothers were living in the Northern Territory.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Indigenous Australian men played significant roles as <a href="Stockman%20%28Australia%29">stockmen</a> in the Australian pastoral industry, and as entertainers participating in competitive demonstrations of stockmen's skills, referred to as rough riding. Dodd worked as a stockman, horse breaker and <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a> rider prior to and during his acting career, including a period working for rider and entertainer <a href="Smoky%20Dawson">Smoky Dawson</a>. He was a member of the Rough Riders Association, and gave exhibition rides at the <a href="Calgary%20Stampede">Calgary Stampede</a> in 1964.

Dodd served in <a href="Korean%20War">Korea</a>, during a six-year stint in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>, with the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a>; his service number was 41018. Interviewed in May 2011 he indicated that he "was the first Aboriginal to sign up from South Australia to go to Korea". A photograph of him in uniform in Korea is amongst images on permanent display at the Australian War Memorial. From 1969 to at least 1973 Dodd worked as a guide for <a href="Airlines%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Airlines of New South Wales</a>, escorting tours to <a href="Uluru">Uluru</a> and other locations in central Australia. Dodd has stated that he demonstrated <a href="boomerang">boomerang</a> and spear-throwing at <a href="Expo%2070">Expo 70</a>, and at an <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> (though which year is unknown). He was also a participant in a re-enactment of Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s landing in Australia, as part of the <a href="Australian%20Bicentenary">Australian Bicentenary</a> celebrations.

In 1985, Dodd was living in <a href="Manly%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Manly, New South Wales</a>, having spent fifteen years in Sydney's northern suburbs. For the last two decades of his life, Dodd lived at <a href="St%20Georges%20Basin%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">St Georges Basin</a> on the south coast of New South Wales, where he died on 10 November 2014, aged 86.

Dodd's first opportunity to act in <a href="Cinema%20of%20Australia">Australian film</a> came in 1946, when actor Chips Rafferty noticed Dodd on the set of "<a href="The%20Overlanders%20%28film%29">The Overlanders</a>" and gave him a small role. It was the first of three Rafferty movies in which Dodd secured a part, the second being "<a href="Bitter%20Springs%20%28film%29">Bitter Springs</a>" in 1950. This film was notable for being "a serious study of the relations of white settlers and Aborigines" and "more honest than most Australian film-makers ventured to be at that time".

Film writer Bruce Molloy described the film as a "lucid and dramatically effective representation" of black–white conflict in colonial Australia, giving Indigenous Australians "a degree of justice long denied them in cinematic representation".
Dodd was working on "Bitter Springs" as a tracker and interpreter for actor <a href="Michael%20Pate">Michael Pate</a> when Rafferty arranged for him to have an on-screen role. There was a positive relationship between the Indigenous Arrente people and the cast and crew, particularly Rafferty, involved in the location filming for "Bitter Springs" in the area of <a href="Quorn%2C%20South%20Australia">Quorn</a> in northern South Australia. Michael Pate said that Rafferty "wasn't a prejudiced person ... Chips was a person who appreciated the Aborigine [sic] very much ... he got on very well with the people". Dodd, meanwhile, appreciated Rafferty's vision for an Australian film industry and its potential to provide opportunities for Indigenous Australians.

Rafferty was the star of the film that gave Dodd his third minor screen role, "<a href="Kangaroo%20%281952%20film%29">Kangaroo</a>" (1952).

In 1957, the <a href="Rank%20Organisation">J Arthur Rank Organisation</a>, an English company, came to Australia to make a film adaptation of "<a href="Robbery%20Under%20Arms">Robbery Under Arms</a>", an Australian colonial novel by <a href="Thomas%20Alexander%20Browne">Rolf Boldrewood</a>. Dodd travelled to Britain and the United States with the company for six months; in what role is unknown. He said he worked with Rafferty on a fourth film, "<a href="Wake%20in%20Fright">Wake in Fright</a>", in 1971, but Dodd's name does not appear in published cast lists. In the same year, he was cast in the role of an Aboriginal caretaker for a film he said was called "Sacrifice".

On stage, Dodd performed the role of Darky Morris in a 1966 <a href="J.C.%20Williamson">J.C. Williamson</a> stage production of "Desire of the Moth", with a season of nearly three months in Melbourne and Sydney. In 1971, he appeared in an early Sydney production of <a href="Kevin%20Gilbert%20%28author%29">Kevin Gilbert</a>'s seminal work, "The Cherry Pickers".

There were numerous small television roles for Dodd. His work for Smoky Dawson included appearing in a television production, "Adventure with Smoky Dawson: Tim Goes Walkabout", broadcast in June 1966. In other television work, Dodd participated in a <a href="Seven%20Network">Channel 7</a> documentary series about pioneering Australian transport company <a href="Cobb%20and%20Co">Cobb and Co</a>, and also worked on several documentary programs for the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>. Dodd had minor roles in many early Australian TV dramas of the 1960s and 1970s, including "<a href="Skippy%20the%20Bush%20Kangaroo">Skippy the Bush Kangaroo</a>", "<a href="Division%204">Division 4</a>", "Delta" (1969), "Riptide" (1969), "Woobinda – Animal Doctor" (1970), "<a href="Spyforce">Spyforce</a>" (1972–73), "<a href="Homicide%20%28Australian%20series%29">Homicide</a>" (1974), and "<a href="Rush%20%281970s%20TV%20series%29">Rush</a>" (1976). One of these, "Woobinda – Animal Doctor", marked the first appearance of an Indigenous Australian in a television series lead role – not by Dodd, but by a Bindi Williams, playing an adopted son of the show's star. In 1973 it was reported that a television film "Marra Marra" featuring prominent Aboriginal actors <a href="David%20Gumpilil">David Gumpilil</a> and <a href="Bob%20Maza">Bob Maza</a>, together with Dodd and Zac Martin, had been completed.

Although Dodd obtained small parts in several television series, for many years he and his fellow Aboriginal actors found themselves included in only minor and typecast roles in television productions. According to Indigenous actor, historian and activist <a href="Gary%20Foley">Gary Foley</a>, Dodd joked that "he was sick of roles where his total dialogue was, 'he went that way, Boss!'" Reflecting on this issue, a commentator remarked on the 1978 film "<a href="Little%20Boy%20Lost%20%281978%20film%29">Little Boy Lost</a>": "There are many irrelevant scenes, the most obvious one being where Tracker Bindi (Steve Dodd), an Aboriginal, is introduced – yet another tired reinforcement of a false stereotype."

Dodd contributed to several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as <a href="Indigenous%20land%20rights">land rights</a> and race relations, were the central subjects. These appearances included "Bitter Springs" (mentioned above) and "<a href="The%20Chant%20of%20Jimmie%20Blacksmith">The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith</a>" (1978), the first of two films in which he appeared alongside <a href="Jack%20Thompson%20%28actor%29">Jack Thompson</a>. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by <a href="Angela%20Punch%20McGregor">Angela Punch McGregor</a>). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, "a tribal elder, ... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as "wonderful as sots: ... Steve Dodds [sic], who is tried for murder and simply says, 'You'd think it would take a good while to make up your mind to kill someone and then to kill them, but take my word for it, it only takes a second'".

Dodd's career was busiest in the 1980s, and by 1985 it was reported that he had acted in 55 movies or television features. In 1981 he played Billy Snakeskin in the film "<a href="Gallipoli%20%281981%20film%29">Gallipoli</a>", about the fate of young men who participated in the World War I <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of 1915. This was followed by parts in "Chase Through the Night" and "Essington", both in 1984. In 1985 he played the role of Mr Joe in "The Coca-Cola Kid", an Australian romantic comedy with an international cast including <a href="Eric%20Roberts">Eric Roberts</a> and <a href="Greta%20Scacchi">Greta Scacchi</a>. In 1986 he appeared in the film "Short Changed", while through the mid-1980s he had minor parts in the popular television series "<a href="The%20Flying%20Doctors">The Flying Doctors</a>" (1985–1988).

"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" was not the only film in which Dodd appeared that addressed topical Indigenous issues of the day. A decade after "Jimmie Blacksmith", Dodd performed in "<a href="Ground%20Zero%20%281987%20film%29">Ground Zero</a>", again with Jack Thompson in one of the lead roles. This film is a thriller based on claims that Indigenous Australians were used as human guinea pigs in the <a href="British%20nuclear%20tests%20at%20Maralinga">British nuclear tests at Maralinga</a>. The film uses as its context the <a href="McClelland%20Royal%20Commission">McClelland Royal Commission</a>, which was investigating radioactive contamination at the site. In the film, Dodd plays a minor character named Freddy Tjapaljarri.

Sources differ on whether Dodd had a part in "<a href="Evil%20Angels%20%28film%29">Evil Angels</a>" (released as "A Cry in the Dark" outside of Australia and New Zealand), the 1988 film about the <a href="Azaria%20Chamberlain%20disappearance">Azaria Chamberlain disappearance</a>, with Dodd's name not included in the cast list published by "Australian Film 1978–1994", but appearing in the longer cast listing provided by IMDb. In 1988 he played a minor role in "<a href="Kadaicha">Kadaicha</a>", an unreleased <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> about a series of unexplained murders. In 1990 Dodd appeared in two films: "Quigley Down Under", a <a href="western%20%28genre%29">western</a> made in Australia but starring American <a href="Tom%20Selleck">Tom Selleck</a> and Briton <a href="Alan%20Rickman">Alan Rickman</a>; and "The Crossing", an Australian drama set in a country town.

Dodd's career returned to politically contentious Indigenous issues when he played a minor role, of Kummengu, in the 1991 film "<a href="Deadly%20%28film%29">Deadly</a>". This film is a police drama based around the death of an Indigenous man in police custody. As in "Ground Zero", the subject was very topical: the movie was released at the same time as the report of the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20into%20Aboriginal%20Deaths%20in%20Custody">Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</a>, which had for four years been examining why so many Indigenous Australians <a href="Aboriginal%20deaths%20in%20custody">died in police detention</a>.

In 1999, Dodd was one of three actors in "Wind", a short film portraying the pursuit of an old Aboriginal man (Dodd) by a young black tracker and a white police sergeant. That same year was marked by the most commercially successful film of his career, "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>". Later, Dodd played minor roles in an episode of television series "<a href="The%20Alice">The Alice</a>" (2006) and the movies "My Country" (2007) and "Broken Sun" (2008); by this time his career in film and television had lasted for over sixty years.

In 2013, Dodd received the Jimmy Little Lifetime Achievement Award at the <a href="Deadly%20Awards%202013">19th Deadly Awards</a> at the <a href="Sydney%20Opera%20House">Sydney Opera House</a>. Departing from tradition by presenting the award to someone who was not primarily a musician, the organisers described Dodd as "an actor that created a pathway for others across the entire arts and music sectors to follow, at a time when typecasting stereotypes and discrimination was the 'norm' in Australia's arts industry".

Portrait of Monsieur Bertin

Portrait of Monsieur Bertin is an 1832 oil on canvas painting by <a href="Jean-Auguste-Dominique%20Ingres">Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres</a>. It depicts <a href="Louis-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Bertin">Louis-François Bertin</a> (1766–1841), the French writer, art collector and director of the pro-royalist "<a href="Journal%20des%20d%C3%A9bats">Journal des débats</a>". Ingres completed the portrait during his first period of success; having achieved acclaim as a <a href="History%20painting">history painter</a>, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the French upper-middle class. Ingres presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal <a href="July%20Monarchy">reign</a> of <a href="Louis%20Philippe%20I">Louis Philippe I</a>. He is physically imposing and self-assured, but his real-life personality shines through – warm, wry and engaging to those who had earned his trust.

The painting had a prolonged genesis. Ingres agonised over the pose and made several preparatory sketches. The final work faithfully captures the sitter's character, conveying both a restless energy and imposing bulk. It is an unflinchingly <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realistic</a> depiction of ageing and emphasises the furrowed skin and thinning hair of an overweight man who yet maintains his resolve and determination. He sits in three-quarter profile against a brown ground lit from the right, his fingers are pronounced and highly detailed, while the polish of his chair reflects light from an unseen window.

Ingres' portrait of Bertin was a critical and popular success, but the sitter was a private person. Although his family worried about caricature and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Paris Salon</a> of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Bonnat">Léon Bonnat</a> and later modernists including <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> and <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Vallotton">Félix Vallotton</a>. Today art critics regard it as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Musée du Louvre</a> since 1897.

Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, the year of the portrait. He befriended Ingres either through his son <a href="%C3%89douard%20Bertin">Édouard Bertin</a>, a student of the painter, or via <a href="%C3%89tienne-Jean%20Del%C3%A9cluze">Étienne-Jean Delécluze</a>, Ingres' friend and the "Journal"'s art critic. In either case the genesis of the commission is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of <a href="Louis%20Philippe%20I">Louis Philippe</a> and the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">Bourbon Restoration</a>. He was a director of the "<a href="Le%20Moniteur%20Universel">Le Moniteur Universel</a>" until 1823, when the "<a href="Journal%20des%20d%C3%A9bats">Journal des débats</a>" became the recognised voice of the <a href="Liberalism">liberal</a>-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize <a href="Absolute%20monarchy">absolutism</a>. He eventually gave his support to the <a href="July%20Monarchy">July Monarchy</a>. The "Journal" supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.
It was completed within a month, during Ingres' frequent visits to Bertin's estate of retreat, <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20des%20Roches%20%28Bi%C3%A8vres%29">Le Château des Roches</a>, in <a href="Bi%C3%A8vres%2C%20Essonne">Bièvres, Essonne</a>. Ingres made daily visits, as Bertin entertained guests such as <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, his mistress <a href="Juliette%20Drouet">Juliette Drouet</a>, <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>, and later <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> and <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Charles Gounod</a>. Ingres later made drawings of the Bertin family, including a depiction of his host's wife and sketches of their son Armand and daughter-in-law, Cécile. The portrait of Armand evidences his physical resemblance to his father.

Ingres' early career coincided with the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> movement, which reacted against the prevailing <a href="Neoclassicism%23Painting%20and%20the%20decorative%20arts">neoclassical</a> style. Neoclassicism in French art had developed as artists saw themselves as part of the cultural center of Europe, and France as the successor to Rome. Romantic painting was freer and more expressive, preoccupied more with colour than with line or form, and more focused on style than on subject matter. Paintings based on classical themes fell out of fashion, replaced by contemporary rather than historical subject matter, especially in portraiture. Ingres resisted this trend, and wrote, "The history painter shows the species in general; while the portrait painter represents only the specific individual—a model often ordinary and full of shortcomings." From his early career, Ingres' main source of income was <a href="Commission%20%28art%29">commissioned</a> portraits, a genre he dismissed as lacking in grandeur. The success of his "<a href="The%20Vow%20of%20Louis%20XIII">The Vow of Louis XIII</a>" at the 1824 Salon marked an abrupt change in his fortunes: he received a series of commissions for large history paintings, and for the next decade he painted few portraits. His financial difficulties behind him, Ingres could afford to concentrate on historical subjects, although he was highly sought-after as a portraitist. He wrote in 1847, "Damned portraits, they are so difficult to do that they prevent me getting on with greater things that I could do more quickly."

Ingres was more successful with female than male portraits. His 1814 "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Madame%20de%20Senonnes">Portrait of Madame de Senonnes</a>" was described as "to the feminine what the Louvre's Bertin is to the masculine". The sitter for his 1848 "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Baronne%20de%20Rothschild">Portrait of Baronne de Rothschild</a>" looks out at the viewer with the same directness as Bertin, but is softened by her attractive dress and relaxed pose; she is engaging and sympathetic rather than tough and imposing.

Ingres was self-critical and consumed by self-doubt. He often took months to complete a portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.

The earliest study has Bertin standing and leaning on a table in an almost <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>ic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.

Frustrated by his inability to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and just as long as you want me to come, I am at your orders.'" After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. 

Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. <a href="Henri%20Delaborde%20%28painter%29">Henri Delaborde</a> said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Emmanuel%20Amaury%20Duval">Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval</a> (who said he had heard the story from Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café. Bertin said that Ingres, confident that he had finally established the pose for the portrait, "came close and speaking almost in my ear said: 'Come sit tomorrow, your portrait is [as good as] done.'" Bertin's final pose reverses the usual relationship between the two men. The artist becomes the cool, detached observer; Bertin, usually calm and reasoned, is now restless and impatient, mirroring Ingres' irritation at spending time on portraiture.

Bertin is presented as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as "crab-like claws ... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are the sleeves of his coat." The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and <a href="cravat">cravat</a> revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian <a href="Robert%20Rosenblum">Robert Rosenblum</a>, his "nearly ferocious presence" is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar.
The painting is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are the whites of his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a>. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer in a manner that is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by <a href="Nicolas%20Poussin">Nicolas Poussin</a>'s 1650 "Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting", Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.
Ingres seems to have adapted elements of the approach and technique of <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger">Hans Holbein</a>'s 1527 "Portrait of <a href="William%20Warham">William Warham</a>", now in the Louvre. Neither artist placed much emphasis on colour, preferring dark or cool tones. The Warham portrait seems to have informed the indicators of Bertin's aging and the emphasis on his fingers. Jacques-Louis David also explored hyper-realism in his depictions of Cooper Penrose (1802) and <a href="Emmanuel%20Joseph%20Siey%C3%A8s">Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès</a> (1817). In the later painting, David shows tiny glints of light reflecting on the sitter's chair and painstakingly details "every wayward curl of [Sieyès'] closely cropped auburn hair."

The Greek <a href="meander%20%28art%29">meander</a> pattern at the foot of the wall is unusually close to the <a href="picture%20plane">picture plane</a>, confining the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Leo%20X%20%28Raphael%29">Portrait of Pope Leo X</a>" (c. 1519) by <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the <a href="Hilt%23Pommel">pommel</a> on the pope's chair.
The painting is signed "J.Ingres Pinxit 1832" in capitals at the top left, and "L.F. Bertin", also in capitals, at the upper right. The frame is the original, and thought to have been designed by Ingres himself. It shows animals around a sinuous and richly carved grapevine. Art historians Paul Mitchell and Lynn Roberts note that the design follows an old French tradition of placing austere male portraits within "exuberantly carved" frames. The frame closely resembles that of Raphael's c. 1514–15 "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Baldassare%20Castiglione">Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione</a>", a painting that influenced Ingres, especially in colour and tone. A similar frame was used for Ingres's 1854 painting of "<a href="Joan%20of%20Arc%20at%20the%20Coronation%20of%20Charles%20VII">Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII</a>".

"Monsieur Bertin" was exhibited at the 1833 <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Salon</a> alongside his 1807 "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Madame%20Duvaucey">Portrait of Madame Duvaucey</a>". It met with near universal praise to become his most successful artwork to that point. It sealed his reputation as a portraitist, reaching far enough into public consciousness to become a standard for newspaper political satires. Today it is considered his greatest portrait. Ingres viewed all this as a mixed blessing, remarking that "since my portraits of Bertin and <a href="Louis-Mathieu%20Mol%C3%A9">Molé</a>, everybody wants portraits. There are six that I've turned down, or am avoiding, because I can't stand them." Before the official exhibition, Ingres displayed the painting in his studio for friends and pupils. Most were lavish in their praise, although Louis Lacuria confided to a friend that he feared people might "find the colouring a bit dreary". He proved correct; at the Salon, critics praised the draftsmanship, but some felt the portrait exemplified Ingres' weakness as a colourist. It was routinely faulted for its "purplish tone"—which the ageing of the oil medium has transformed over time to warm greys and browns. Bertin's wife Louis-Marie reportedly did not like the painting; his daughter, <a href="Louise%20Bertin">Louise</a>, thought it transformed her father from a "great lord" to a "fat farmer".
Given the standings of the two men, the painting was received in both social and political terms. A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either "bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the <a href="July%20Monarchy">July Monarchy</a>, writers at the "<a href="La%20Gazette%20%28France%29">La Gazette de France</a>" viewed the portrait as the epitome of the "opportunism and cynicism" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered "what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism".

Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian <a href="Albert%20Boime">Albert Boime</a> described them as "powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic <a href="Nadar%20%28photographer%29">Félix Tournachon</a> was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a "fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: "A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature".

The work's <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a> attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter. Art historian Geraldine Pelles sees Bertin as "at once intense, suspicious, and aggressive". She notes that there is a certain amount of <a href="Psychological%20projection">projection</a> of the artist's personality and recalls Théophile Silvestre's description of Ingres; "There he was squarely seated in an armchair, motionless as an Egyptian god carved of granite, his hands stretched wide over parallel knees, his torso stiff, his head haughty". Some compared it to <a href="Balthasar%20Denner">Balthasar Denner</a>, a German realist painter influenced by <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>. Denner, in the words of Ingres scholar Robert Rosenblum, "specialised in recording every last line on the faces of aged men and women, and even reflections of windows in their eyes." The comparison was made by Ingres' admirers and detractors alike. In 1833, Louis de Maynard of the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge-lyc%C3%A9e%20Amp%C3%A8re">Collège-lycée Ampère</a>, writing in the influential "L'Europe littéraire", dismissed Denner as a weak painter concerned with hyperrealistic "curiosities", and said that both he and Ingres fell short of the "sublime productions of Ingres' self-proclaimed hero, Raphael."

The following year Ingres sought to capitalise on the success of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting "<a href="The%20Martyrdom%20of%20Saint%20Symphorian">The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian</a>" at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.

Bertin bequeathed the portrait to his daughter Louise (1805–1877) on his death. She passed it to her niece Marie-Louise-Sophie Bertin (1836–1893) wife of Jules Bapst, a later director of the "Journal des débats". They bequeathed it to their niece Cécile Bapst, its last private owner. In 1897 Cécile sold it to the Musée du Louvre for 80,000 <a href="francs">francs</a>.

The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. <a href="Jean-Joseph%20Benjamin-Constant">Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant</a>'s monochrome and severe 1896 "Portrait of Alfred Chauchard" is heavily indebted, while <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Bonnat">Léon Bonnat</a>'s stern 1892 portrait of the aging <a href="Ernest%20Renan">Ernest Renan</a> has been described as a "direct citation" of Ingres' portrait.
Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>'s 1906 "Portrait of Gertrude Stein". Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to <a href="Robert%20Rosenblum">Robert Rosenblum</a>, "Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her "massive, monumental presence". In 1907 the Swiss artist <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Vallotton">Félix Vallotton</a> depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting <a href="%C3%89douard%20Vuillard">Édouard Vuillard</a> to exclaim, "That's Madame Bertin!"

The influence continued through the 20th century. <a href="Gerald%20Kelly">Gerald Kelly</a> recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> between 1952 and 1961. In 1975 <a href="Marcel%20Broodthaers">Marcel Broodthaers</a> produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and <a href="Mademoiselle%20Caroline%20Rivi%C3%A8re">Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière</a>.

Henry Wrigley

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Henry Neilson Wrigley, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a>, <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">AFC</a> (21 April 1892 – 14 September 1987) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). A pioneering flyer and aviation scholar, he piloted the first trans-Australia flight from <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> in 1919, and afterwards laid the groundwork for the RAAF's air power doctrine. During World War I, Wrigley joined the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> and saw combat with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, earning the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>; he later commanded the unit and published a history of its wartime exploits. He was awarded the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> for his 1919 cross-country flight.

Wrigley was a founding member of the RAAF in 1921 and held staff posts in the ensuing years. In 1936, he was promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> and took command of <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>. Raised to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> soon after the outbreak of World War II, he became <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Personnel%20%28Australia%29">Air Member for Personnel</a> in November 1940. One of his tasks was organising the newly established <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> and selecting its director, <a href="Clare%20Stevenson">Clare Stevenson</a>, in 1941. He was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> the same year. Wrigley served as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a>, London, from September 1942 until his retirement from the military in June 1946. He died in 1987 at the age of ninety-five. His writings on air power were collected and published posthumously as "The Decisive Factor" in 1990.

Henry Neilson Wrigley was born on 21 April 1892 in <a href="Collingwood%2C%20Victoria">Collingwood</a>, a suburb of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, to Henry and Beatrice Wrigley. He was educated at <a href="Richmond%2C%20Victoria">Richmond Central School</a> and at <a href="Melbourne%20High%20School">Melbourne High School</a>, where he joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadets</a>. Studying at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, he became a state school teacher and a member of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">militia</a> prior to the outbreak of World War I. He joined the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) on 5 October 1916. Wrigley trained as a pilot under the tutelage of Lieutenant <a href="Eric%20Harrison%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Eric Harrison</a> at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> in <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, before departing Melbourne on 25 October aboard a troopship bound for Europe.

After further training in England, Wrigley was posted to France and flew on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron AFC</a> (also known until 1918 as No. 69 Squadron, <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>). Operating <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20R.E.8">Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8</a>s, the unit was engaged in <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>, <a href="artillery">artillery-spotting</a> and <a href="close%20air%20support">ground support</a> duties. Having been promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28OF-2%29">captain</a>, Wrigley was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for his "exceptional devotion to duty", in particular his persistence in pressing home an attack against enemy infantry on 29 October 1918 in the face of "intense machine gun and rifle fire"; the honour was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 3 June 1919. Wrigley later observed that most wartime aircraft were "impossible to fight in", and that senior officers were "too occupied with coaxing aeroplanes into the air and teaching pilots to bring them down again without breaking their necks" to consider the wider implications of air power.

Wrigley became No. 3 Squadron's commanding officer in January 1919, and returned to Australia on 6 May. Later that year he took part in the first transcontinental flight across Australia, from Melbourne to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, to coincide with the first <a href="1919%20England%20to%20Australia%20flight">England-to-Australia flight</a>. Accompanied by his mechanic and former schoolmate, Sergeant <a href="Arthur%20William%20Murphy">Arthur "Spud" Murphy</a>, Wrigley departed Point Cook on 16 November and arrived in Port Darwin on 12 December, having travelled some in forty-seven flying hours. The men flew in a single-engined <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a>, with no radio, over unmapped and often hazardous terrain, and surveyed seventeen potential landing fields along the way. Wrigley considered the choice of Murphy as his cohort "a particularly happy one" but called the aircraft they were assigned "an obsolete type, even for training purposes", while conceding that "it was structurally sound and airworthy". In recognition of their achievement the men were each awarded the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a>, <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 12 July 1920. Such was the perceived danger of the expedition that while making preparations for the flight back they received a telegram from the Defence Department ordering them to dismantle the B.E.2 and return with it by ship.

On 1 January 1920, Wrigley transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Corps">Australian Air Corps</a> (AAC), a temporary organisation formed by the Army following disbandment of the wartime AFC. He was appointed <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> at Central Flying School the following month. In 1921, Wrigley joined the newly established <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) as a <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>. Popularly known as "Wrig", he was one of the original twenty-one officers on the Air Force's strength at its formation that March. For the next seven years he held staff posts at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, beginning with the position of staff officer to the Director of Personnel and Training. On 5 July 1922, Wrigley married Marjorie Rees; the couple had a son and a daughter. The same month, he replaced Flight Lieutenant <a href="Frank%20McNamara%20%28VC%29">Frank McNamara</a> as Staff Officer (Operations and Intelligence). He served as RAAF Training Officer from March 1923 to April 1925—during which time he was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>—before being appointed Director of Organisation and Staff Duties. In November 1927, he took part in an attempt to make the first night flight from Sydney to Melbourne. Taking off from <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a> in an <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>, Wrigley and his co-pilot were in the air for six hours and covered before a broken fuel line forced them to land for repairs; they completed the journey the following day.
Wrigley travelled to England in 1928 to attend <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, becoming one of the first RAAF officers to complete the course. Remaining in England, he was appointed Australian <a href="Air%20Liaison%20Officer">Air Liaison Officer</a> to the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> in 1929. That October, he initiated correspondence with the British Air Council to discuss a proposal for the RAAF to adopt as its own the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s motto "<a href="Per%20ardua%20ad%20astra">Per Ardua Ad Astra</a>"; informal approval was granted by letter to Wrigley in March 1930. Returning to Australia, he became Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters in October 1930, and Director of Organisation and Staff Duties in December 1931. He was promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in December 1932. In 1935 he published his history of No. 3 Squadron, "The Battle Below", which was considered an authoritative treatment on the subject of <a href="Close%20air%20support">army co-operation</a>. He was promoted <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in July 1936, and that October took over as commanding officer of <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, from Group Captain McNamara. Wrigley handed over the station's command to Group Captain <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a> in February 1939. In May 1939, Wrigley served as the senior expert assessor on the panel of an inquiry into three recent accidents involving <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s; the full report handed down in October found that training on the type followed the syllabus, but that pilots needed more practical experience in dealing with in-flight incidents, as human error was the likely explanation for at least one crash.

As part of the RAAF's reorganisation following the outbreak of World War II, No. 1 Group was formed under Wrigley's command in Melbourne on 20 November 1939, to oversee the operations of air bases and units in Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. Promoted <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>, in 1940 Wrigley served as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a>, the successor organisation to No. 1 Group, before taking up the position of Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in November that year. He was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1941 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. As AMP, Wrigley's responsibilities included organising the <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> (WAAAF), established on 25 March 1941 as the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in the country. He believed that recruiting servicewomen was essential to augment the many ground staff required to support the war effort, and considered that while such an organisation should be constitutionally separate from the RAAF, its members should be closely integrated within the current force structure.

The <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) was at this time an RAF officer, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a>, who hoped to see his daughter Sybil-Jean, a veteran of Britain's <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Air Force</a>, take charge of the WAAAF. Wrigley successfully argued against this, telling Burnett that there had already been "enough public outcry" over a non-Australian being named CAS, and there would be "a further public outcry" if anyone other than an Australian was appointed WAAAF Director. On 21 May, he selected <a href="Berlei">Berlei</a> executive <a href="Clare%20Stevenson">Clare Stevenson</a> as WAAAF Director, passing over temporary appointee <a href="Mary%20Bell%20%28aviator%29">Mary Bell</a>, wife of a serving RAAF group captain. Wrigley chose Stevenson on the basis of her management background and because she was not a "socialite". Bell, who was offered the position of Deputy Director, chose to resign from the WAAAF on learning of Stevenson's appointment, but Wrigley later convinced her to rejoin. Meanwhile, Wrigley played a leading part in the development of the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Force%20Cadets">Air Training Corps</a>, formed in April 1941 to facilitate basic training for youths aged sixteen to eighteen who hoped to become RAAF aircrew.
Wrigley's promotion to acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> was announced in May 1941, making him only the third member of the RAAF—after <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a> and <a href="Stanley%20Goble">Stanley Goble</a>—to attain this rank. In September 1942, he was posted to London to take over from Frank McNamara as AOC <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a>. For a time, he was involved in a tug-of-war with Air Marshal Williams over just who was in charge. Williams, who commanded Overseas Headquarters at its inception in December 1941, with McNamara as his deputy, had subsequently been appointed as the RAAF's representative to <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, leaving McNamara in charge of the London office until Wrigley arrived. The Minister for Air, <a href="Arthur%20Drakeford">Arthur Drakeford</a>, was in favour of Williams commanding the RAAF offices in both the US and UK while Wrigley acted for him in London, despite Wrigley having been appointed AOC. Wrigley's diary recorded that when Williams returned to London in October 1942 to attend a conference, he began "throwing his weight around" and "intriguing to have himself made AOC, and possibly AOC in C [Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief] of all RAAF units and personnel outside Australia and the SW Pacific". Although Williams departed England in January 1943, the matter was only fully laid to rest in mid-1943, when the CAS, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, advised Williams that it was impractical for him to command offices in both Washington and London.

As AOC RAAF Overseas Headquarters, Wrigley was responsible for looking after the interests of RAAF aircrew stationed in the European and the Middle Eastern theatres, liaising between the British Air Ministry and the Australian government regarding technical developments and information on the <a href="Pacific%20War">war in the Pacific</a>, and negotiating revisions to the terms of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> (EATS). The role had little influence on the deployment of Australian personnel for the air offensive in Europe, who were subject to RAF policy and strategy even when they belonged to RAAF squadrons. According to the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of Australia in the war</a>, Wrigley and his predecessors could hardly do more than "retard the centrifugal forces affecting Australian disposition, and repair the worst administrative difficulties arising from wide dispersion".
Wrigley became a familiar and popular figure for the thousands of Australian airmen who passed through London during the war, and was known to take off his jacket and tend bar at Codgers, the headquarters' watering hole. An EATS graduate later remarked that "under Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley we got tremendous service ... I was in North Africa, Italy, Sardinia, Corsica and then back in the United Kingdom. We got our mail, we got our comforts ... Not only that, when some cow went and pinched 100 quid from me when I was on leave in London, the next day, with a shaking hand, I was able to sign for another 100 quid and have a good time."

In March 1943, following negotiations that had begun the previous year, Wrigley signed a revision of EATS that finally recognised Australia's "national aspirations" regarding concentration of her airmen in RAAF squadrons as opposed to them being scattered throughout RAF units, reasonable prospects of promotion and rotation for staff, and pay and other conditions of service confirmed as being per RAAF stipulations. The official history contended that "for the most part Australia was still left chasing a dream rather than a reality", as many clauses in the agreement were "subject to operational exigencies" and to be adhered to only "as far as possible". Wrigley toured the Mediterranean in September, visiting <a href="No.%20459%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 459 Squadron</a> in the Middle East, and travelling to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> to interview ground staff of <a href="No.%20450%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 450 Squadron</a> over their grievances concerning lack of promotion and leave; his presence was considered to have defused this situation.

Wrigley's son Ronald enlisted in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> in September 1944 and served until his demobilisation in 1946. The end of hostilities in Europe on 7 May 1945 raised a major logistical challenge for Wrigley as the senior officer responsible for some 13,500 RAAF personnel spread across Britain, the Mediterranean, and the continent, only a minority of whom were in nominally Australian squadrons, the bulk serving with RAF establishments. "The task was energetically met", according to the official history; fewer than 1,000 RAAF personnel remained in RAF units by 1 September, although repatriation continued through into the new year.

Wrigley was forcibly retired from the RAAF in 1946, along with other senior commanders and veterans of World War I, ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. Keenly disappointed with the decision, Wrigley was officially discharged on 6 June. He found it difficult to secure civilian employment because, "by the time I got back, all the worthwhile jobs round Australia had been snapped up by people, not only air force people but other people on the spot". After an unsuccessful attempt to run his own retail business, he "eventually earned a living by taking on some administrative jobs which carried on for a few years". Wrigley was made an honorary air vice marshal in July 1956. In 1966 he became executive officer of the Victorian Overseas Foundation, and later a trustee. He published "Aircraft and Economic Development: The RAAF Contribution" through the <a href="Royal%20Aeronautical%20Society">Royal Aeronautical Society</a> in 1969. In March 1971, he was among a select group of surviving founding members of the RAAF who attended a celebratory dinner at the <a href="Hotel%20Canberra">Hotel Canberra</a> to mark the service's <a href="Golden%20Jubilee">Golden Jubilee</a>; his fellow guests included Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams, Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Bill Anderson</a>, Air Commodore <a href="Hippolyte%20De%20La%20Rue">Hippolyte De La Rue</a>, and Wing Commander <a href="Lawrence%20Wackett">Sir Lawrence Wackett</a>. After the death of his first wife, Marjorie, Wrigley married Zenda Edwards on 5 January 1972. In December 1979, he was the guest of honour at celebrations marking sixty years of flying at Darwin; the RAAF flew him from Point Cook to Darwin to commemorate his historic 1919 flight with Arthur Murphy. Wrigley wrote a history of the Victorian branch of the United Services Institution in 1980. Aged ninety-five, he died in Melbourne on 14 September 1987.

Throughout his life, Wrigley was an "inveterate note-taker" who compiled extensive documentation concerning the theory and practice of air power, on which he lectured among colleagues in the RAAF during the 1920s. The concepts that he propagated included <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a>, the need for an air force to be separate from the other branches of the armed services, control of the air as a means of carrying out offensive strikes, and the substitution of aerial forces for ground troops. While arguing for the independence of the air arm, Wrigley was quick to dispel any notion that it would simply "arrive from God knows where, drop [its] bombs God knows where, and go off again God knows where"; rather it should act in concert with the army and navy in furtherance of government policy. He is thus credited with laying the foundations for the RAAF's modern air power doctrine, which would eventually be codified as the "Air Power Manual" in 1990. Wrigley's widow bequeathed twenty volumes of his writings, maps, and photographs to the <a href="RAAF%20Museum">RAAF Museum</a> at Point Cook after his death; they were edited and published by Air Commodore Brendan O'Loghlin and Wing Commander Alan Stephens in 1990 as "The Decisive Factor: Air Power Doctrine by Air Vice-Marshal H.N. Wrigley". In 1996, Wrigley's former residence as commanding officer of RAAF Station Laverton prior to World War II was christened Wrigley House in his honour. His name is also borne by Henry Wrigley Drive, approaching <a href="Darwin%20International%20Airport">Darwin International Airport</a>. In March 2010, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of Air Force</a>, Air Marshal <a href="Mark%20Binskin">Mark Binskin</a>, established the AVM H.N. Wrigley Prize for air power analysis, as part of the annual Chief of Air Force Essay Competition.

Vernon Sturdee

<a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir Vernon Ashton Hobart Sturdee, (16 April 1890 – 25 May 1966) was an <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> commander who served two terms as <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>. A regular officer of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Engineers">Royal Australian Engineers</a> who joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> in 1908, he was one of the original <a href="Australian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps">Anzacs</a> during the First World War, participating in the <a href="Landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Gallipoli</a> on 25 April 1915. In the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">campaign</a> that followed, he commanded the 5th Field Company, before going on to lead the 8th Field Company and the <a href="4th%20Pioneer%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">4th Pioneer Battalion</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. In 1918 he was seconded to General Headquarters (GHQ) <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> as a staff officer.

Promotion was stagnant between the wars, and Sturdee remained at his wartime rank of <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> until 1935. He served in a series of staff posts, and attended the <a href="Command%20and%20Staff%20College">Staff College</a> at <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a> in <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a> and the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> in Britain. Like other regular officers, he had little faith in the government's "<a href="Singapore%20strategy">Singapore strategy</a>", and warned that the Army would have to face an effective and well-equipped <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> opponent.

Ranked <a href="colonel">colonel</a> at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sturdee was raised to <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">lieutenant general</a> in 1940 and became Chief of the General Staff. He proceeded to conduct a doomed defence of the islands to the north of Australia against the advancing Japanese forces. In 1942, he successfully advised the government to divert the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> troops returning from the Middle East to Australia. He then became head of the Australian Military Mission to Washington, D.C., where he represented Australia before the <a href="Combined%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Combined Chiefs of Staff</a>. As commander of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Army">First Army</a> in New Guinea in 1944–45, Sturdee directed the fighting at <a href="Aitape%E2%80%93Wewak%20campaign">Aitape</a>, and on <a href="New%20Britain%20campaign">New Britain</a> and <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville</a>. He was charged with destroying the enemy when opportunity presented itself, but had to do so with limited resources, and without committing his troops to battles that were beyond their strength.

When the war ended, Sturdee took the surrender of Japanese forces in the <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> area. As one of the Army's most senior officers, he succeeded General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a> as Commander in Chief of the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a> in December 1945. He became the Chief of the General Staff a second time in 1946, serving in the post until his retirement in 1950. During this term, he had to demobilise the wartime Army while fielding and supporting the Australian contingent of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> in Japan. He developed a structure for the post-war Army that included regular combat formations. As a result, the Australian Regular Army was formed, laying the foundations for the service as it exists today.

Vernon Ashton Hobart Sturdee was born in <a href="Frankston%2C%20Victoria">Frankston, Victoria</a>, on 16 April 1890, the son of Alfred Hobart Sturdee and his wife Laura Isabell, née Merrett. Alfred Sturdee, a medical practitioner from England, came from a prominent naval family and was the brother of <a href="Doveton%20Sturdee">Doveton Sturdee</a>, who later became an <a href="admiral%20of%20the%20fleet">admiral of the fleet</a>. Alfred emigrated to Australia in the 1880s, travelling as a ship's doctor. He served in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a>, where he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> after he rode under fire to a <a href="wikt%3Adonga">donga</a> near the enemy's position to aid wounded men. Re-enlisting in the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a> as a <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> in January 1905, he was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> in August 1908 and <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> in December 1912. He later commanded the 2nd Field Ambulance at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> and, with the rank of <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, was Assistant Director of Medical Services of the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Division</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. He received three more mentions in despatches and was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a>. His Australian-born wife Laura, known as Lil, was the sister of <a href="Charles%20Merrett">Charles Merrett</a>, a prominent businessman and <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> officer. Her half-brother, Colonel Harry Perrin, was another Militia officer.

Vernon Sturdee was educated at <a href="Melbourne%20Grammar%20School">Melbourne Grammar School</a>, before being apprenticed to an engineer at Jaques Brothers, <a href="Richmond%2C%20Victoria">Richmond, Victoria</a>. Commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the Corps of Engineers, the Militia's engineer component, on 19 October 1908, he was promoted to <a href="first%20lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Engineers">Royal Australian Engineers</a>, as the permanent component was then known, on 1 February 1911. He married Edith Georgina Robins on 4 February 1913 at St Luke's Church of England, <a href="Fitzroy%20North%2C%20Victoria">North Fitzroy</a>, Melbourne.

Sturdee joined the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 25 August 1914 with the rank of lieutenant. He was promoted to captain on 18 October, and appointed <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> of the 1st Division Engineers. He embarked from Melbourne for Egypt on the former <a href="Peninsular%20and%20Oriental%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company">P&O</a> <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> <a href="RMS%20Orvieto">RMS "Orvieto"</a> on 21 October 1914. He participated in the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a> on <a href="Anzac%20Day">25 April 1915</a>, disembarking from the transport before 9:00. His duties included supervising the engineer stores park on the beach at <a href="Anzac%20Cove">Anzac Cove</a>, as well as the construction of <a href="jam%20tin%20grenade">jam tin grenade</a>s. He was evacuated twice for hospital treatment for <a href="enteric%20fever">enteric fever</a> and for serious damage to his stomach lining from internal burns as a result of too much "<a href="Condy%27s%20crystals">Condy's crystals</a>" disinfectant being put into drinking water. As a result, he was to suffer stomach problems for the rest of his life. In July, Sturdee contracted <a href="influenza">influenza</a> and was evacuated from Anzac Cove.

Sturdee was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> on 28 August 1915, and in September assumed command of the 5th Field Company, a unit raised in Egypt to support the newly formed <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">2nd Division</a>. From then until the end of the campaign, he was responsible for all <a href="Military%20engineering">engineering</a> and <a href="Mining%20%28military%29">mining</a> work at Steele's, Quinn's and Courtney's Posts, three of the northernmost and most dangerous and exposed parts of the line. He departed Anzac Cove for the last time on 17 December 1915, two days before the final evacuation.

On returning to Egypt after the evacuation of Anzac, Sturdee assumed responsibility for the provision of hutting at the AIF reinforcement camp at <a href="Tall%20al%20Kabir">Tel el Kebir</a>. There was already another 5th Field Company in Egypt, which had been raised in Australia. Accordingly, Sturdee's 5th Field Company was renumbered 8th, and assigned to the <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th Division</a> when it was formed in February 1916. This move gave the new division an experienced field company, but at the expense of items of the company's mail going to France for a time and arriving back in Egypt marked "Not Fifth, try Eighth."
The 5th Division moved to France in June 1916, where it participated in the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Fromelles">Battle of Fromelles</a> in July. During the action, Sturdee's 8th Field Company supported the <a href="8th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">8th Infantry Brigade</a>. A trench dug by the former facilitated the latter's withdrawal across <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>. For his service at Gallipoli and Fromelles, he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>, and awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>. Heavy losses in the fighting at Fromelles prevented the 5th Division from participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>. To free up another division to participate, <a href="II%20ANZAC%20Corps">II ANZAC Corps</a> organised "Franks Force" to take over a divisional frontage in the <a href="Houplines">Houplines</a> sector, and Sturdee became its Commander Royal Engineers (CRE). When the 5th Division finally moved to the Somme sector in November, he became CRE in charge of the road from <a href="Albert%2C%20Somme">Albert</a> to <a href="Montauban-de-Picardie">Montauban</a>.

On 13 February 1917, Sturdee was appointed to command the 4th Pioneer Battalion, with the rank of <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>. <a href="Pioneer%20%28military%29">Pioneer</a> battalions were organised as infantry but contained a high percentage of tradesmen and were employed on construction tasks under engineer supervision. Over the next nine months the 4th Pioneer Battalion maintained roads, built camps, laid cables and dug trenches and dugouts. By 1917, the Australian government was pushing strongly for <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> officers holding Australian commands and staff posts to be replaced by Australians. As part of this "Australianisation" of the <a href="Australian%20Corps">Australian Corps</a>, Sturdee became CRE of the 5th Division on 25 November 1917, replacing a British Army officer. On 27 March 1918, Sturdee was seconded to General Headquarters (GHQ) <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> as a staff officer, remaining there until 22 October 1918. This provided a rare opportunity, for an Australian officer, of observing the workings of a major headquarters engaged in active operations. For his service on the Western Front, Sturdee was mentioned in despatches a second time, and appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> for his work at GHQ.

Sturdee embarked for Australia on 16 November 1918, and his AIF appointment was terminated on 14 March 1919. He was entitled to his AIF rank of lieutenant colonel as an honorary rank, but his substantive rank was still only that of a captain. He was given the <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1920, but this did not become substantive until 1 April 1932. Sturdee initially served as Senior Engineer Officer on the staff of the <a href="3rd%20Military%20District%20%28Australia%29">3rd Military District</a> at <a href="Victoria%20Barracks%2C%20Melbourne">Victoria Barracks, Melbourne</a>. In 1921, he attended the <a href="Command%20and%20Staff%20College">Staff College</a> at <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a> in <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a>. He was an instructor in military engineering and surveying at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a> from 16 February to 31 December 1924, before returning to Melbourne to serve on the staff of the <a href="4th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">4th Division</a> until 26 March 1929. Posted to the United Kingdom, he served at the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> and attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> in 1931. From 1 January 1931 to 31 December 1932, he was the military representative at the <a href="High%20Commission%20of%20Australia%20in%20London">High Commission of Australia in London</a>.

Sturdee was Director of Military Operations and Intelligence at Army Headquarters in Melbourne from 14 February 1933 to 1 March 1938, a period "when the Army was at rock bottom", and then served as Director of Staff Duties until 12 October 1938. He was given the brevet rank of colonel on 1 July 1935; this became temporary on 1 July 1936 and finally substantive on 1 July 1937, over twenty years after he had become a lieutenant colonel in the AIF. He was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> in 1939 for his services on the Army Headquarters staff.

Like his predecessor as Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, Colonel <a href="John%20Lavarack">John Lavarack</a>, and many other officers, Sturdee had little faith in the government's "<a href="Singapore%20strategy">Singapore strategy</a>", which aimed to deter Japanese aggression through the presence of a powerful British fleet based at <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. In 1933, Sturdee told senior officers that the Japanese 

In 1939, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>, Lieutenant General <a href="Ernest%20Squires">Ernest Squires</a>, implemented a reorganisation of the Army in which the old military districts were replaced by larger commands led by lieutenant generals. On 13 October 1939, Sturdee was promoted from colonel to lieutenant general and assumed control of the new Eastern Command. He had to supervise the raising, training and equipping of the new <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> units being formed in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, as well as the now-conscript Militia.

On 1 July 1940, Sturdee accepted a demotion to <a href="major%20general%20%28Australia%29">major general</a> in order to become the commander of Second AIF's newly raised <a href="8th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">8th Division</a>, receiving the Second AIF serial number NX35000. His period in this command was brief. On 13 August 1940, the Chief of the General Staff, General <a href="Brudenell%20White">Sir Brudenell White</a>, was killed in the <a href="1940%20Canberra%20air%20disaster">Canberra air disaster</a>. Sturdee was restored to his rank of lieutenant general and appointed Chief of the General Staff. As such, he was responsible for the training and maintenance of the AIF in the Middle East and the Far East—although not their operational control—and for the administration and training of the Militia.

As the prospect of war with Japan became more likely, so also did the need to make appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a <a href="Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-chief</a>. In April 1941, the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for the Army</a>, <a href="Percy%20Spender">Percy Spender</a>, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or <a href="Army%20Council%20%281904%29">Army Council</a> as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate <a href="General%20officer%20commanding">GOC</a> Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General <a href="Iven%20Mackay">Sir Iven Mackay</a> was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph%20%28Sydney%29">Sunday Telegraph</a>" and "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" advocated the appointment.

Sturdee attempted to defend the islands to the north of Australia as best he could. With only one AIF infantry brigade available, the <a href="23rd%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">23rd</a>, he could only afford to protect the islands most strategically important to the defence of Australia. He sent the 2/21st Infantry Battalion to <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambon</a>, the 2/22nd to <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>, and the <a href="2/40th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/40th Infantry Battalion</a> and <a href="2/2nd%20Commando%20Squadron%20%28Australia%29">2/2nd Independent Company</a> to <a href="Timor">Timor</a>. Sturdee knew that their prospects were slim but expected them "to put up the best possible defence" with what resources they had, and hopefully slow the Japanese advance to allow time for reinforcements to arrive in Australia. When there were doubts about the morale of one commander, Sturdee replaced him with a staff officer from Army Headquarters who volunteered for the position despite being well aware of the odds. All the garrisons were overrun after a spirited defence, except for the 2/2nd Independent Company, which managed to hold on in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a>.

In February 1942, on advice from Lavarack that the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> would soon fall, Sturdee urged the Australian government that the 17,800 troops returning from the Middle East, originally bound for <a href="Java">Java</a>, be diverted to Australia. Sturdee contended that Java could not be held, and that Allied resources should instead be concentrated in an area from which an offensive could be launched. The best place for this, he argued, was Australia. When <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> backed his Chief of the General Staff, it brought him into conflict with British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and United States President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who suggested that the AIF be diverted to Burma. In the end, Curtin won his point, and subsequent events vindicated Sturdee's appreciation of the situation. Official historian Lionel Wigmore concluded: 

In March 1942, the Military Board was abolished and General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a> was appointed Commander in Chief. Blamey decided that after the hectic events of the previous months, Sturdee needed a rest and appointed him as Head of the Australian Military Mission to Washington, D.C., where the war's strategy was now being decided. Sturdee accepted on condition that after a year's duty in Washington he would be appointed to an important command. In Washington, Sturdee represented Australia before the <a href="Combined%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Combined Chiefs of Staff</a> and managed to obtain the right of direct access to the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the United States Army</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a>. For his services as Chief of the General Staff, Sturdee was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> on 1 January 1943.

Sturdee returned to Australia and assumed command of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Army">First Army</a> on 1 March 1944. His headquarters was initially located in Queensland, but on 2 October 1944 it commenced operations in <a href="Lae">Lae</a>, and Sturdee assumed command of the troops in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. These included Lieutenant General <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a>'s <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a>, with its headquarters at <a href="Torokina">Torokina</a> on <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a>; Major General <a href="Alan%20Ramsay">Alan Ramsay</a>'s <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th Division</a> on <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>; Major General <a href="Jack%20Stevens">Jack Stevens</a>' <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> at <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a>; and the <a href="8th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">8th Infantry Brigade</a> west of <a href="Madang">Madang</a>. On 18 October, Blamey issued an operational instruction that defined the role of the First Army: "by offensive action to destroy enemy resistance as opportunity offers without committing major forces."

Sturdee was concerned by this order's ambiguity and sought clarification from Blamey. The Commander in Chief responded by stating that "my conception is that action must be of a gradual nature" involving the use of patrols to determine Japanese strengths and positions before large offensives were undertaken. The situation on New Britain was straightforward enough; the enemy was known to be stronger than the Australian forces there—although it was not realised just how much stronger—and so the best that could be done was to eliminate small numbers of Japanese troops by aggressive patrolling. At Aitape, Stevens was tasked on the one hand with pushing the Japanese back far enough to protect the airfields; but on the other, with not allowing the 6th Division to become heavily engaged since it might be required for use elsewhere. On Bougainville, Savige had the strength and ability to conduct a major campaign, but Blamey counselled caution.
Juggling a number of contradictory requirements, Sturdee had to conduct three widely separated campaigns, the <a href="Aitape%E2%80%93Wewak%20campaign">Aitape–Wewak campaign</a>, the <a href="New%20Britain%20campaign">New Britain campaign</a> and the <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville Campaign</a>, and do so with limited resources. Shipping, which was controlled by <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s GHQ <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, was a source of "continual anxiety". On 18 July 1945, Sturdee wrote to Savige:

Sturdee's operations were effective. On Bougainville, at a cost of 516 Australian dead and 1,572 wounded, Savige's troops had occupied much of the island and killed 8,500 Japanese; another 9,800 died from malnutrition and disease. On New Britain, where 74 Australians died and 140 were wounded, the heavily outnumbered 5th Division had overrun central New Britain. Meanwhile, the 6th Division at Aitape and Wewak had lost 442 dead and 1,141 wounded while clearing the Japanese from the coast and driving them into the mountains, killing 9,000 and taking 269 prisoners.

On 6 September 1945, Sturdee received the surrender of Japanese forces in the First Army area from General <a href="Hitoshi%20Imamura">Hitoshi Imamura</a>, the commander of the <a href="Japanese%20Eighth%20Area%20Army">Japanese Eighth Area Army</a>, and Admiral <a href="Jinichi%20Kusaka">Jinichi Kusaka</a>, the commander of the South East Area Fleet, in a ceremony held on the deck of the British <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> at Rabaul. The two Japanese swords handed over in the surrender ceremony, together with the sword worn by Sturdee, which was his father's, were presented to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> by Lady Sturdee in 1982. For his service in the final campaigns, Blamey recommended Sturdee for a knighthood, but this was reduced to a third mention in despatches.

In November 1945, the Minister for the Army, <a href="Frank%20Forde">Frank Forde</a>, informed Blamey that the government had decided to re-establish the Military Board and he should therefore vacate his office. Sturdee became acting Commander in Chief on 1 December 1945. On 1 March 1946, the post of Commander in Chief was abolished and Sturdee became Chief of the General Staff again. There was much work to be done; the wartime Army had a strength of 383,000 in August 1945, of whom 177,000 were serving outside Australia.
These troops had to be demobilised, but what should replace the wartime Army had not yet been determined. Sturdee and his Vice Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General <a href="Sydney%20Rowell">Sydney Rowell</a>, had to develop an appropriate structure. The proposal submitted to <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Australia">Cabinet</a> called for <a href="national%20service">national service</a>, a regular army of 33,000 and reserves of 42,000, but the government baulked at the £20m per annum price tag. A smaller force of 19,000 regulars and 50,000 reservists at a cost of £12.5m per annum was finally approved in 1947. Conditions of service were also overhauled.

At the same time, the Army had to handle huge stockpiles of equipment, stores and supplies. Some were far in excess of the Army's needs and had to be disposed of. Hospitals still had to be run, although some were transferred to the <a href="Department%20of%20Repatriation">Department of Repatriation</a>. The Army had to maintain its schools and training establishments. Moreover, the Army had to field and maintain part of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> in Japan. Over next fifty years, operations would be conducted by the new <a href="Australian%20Regular%20Army">Australian Regular Army</a> that Sturdee created, rather than the Militia or specially enlisted expeditionary forces.

Sturdee retired on 17 April 1950. In recognition of his services, he was created a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> on 1 January 1951. In retirement, he continued to live in <a href="Kooyong%2C%20Melbourne">Kooyong, Melbourne</a>. He became a director of the Australian arm of <a href="Standard%20Telephones%20and%20Cables">Standard Telephones and Cables</a> and was honorary colonel of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Electrical%20and%20Mechanical%20Engineers">Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers</a> from 1951 to 1956. The Army named the <a href="Landing%20Ship%20Medium">Landing Ship Medium</a> <a href="Australian%20landing%20ship%20medium%20Vernon%20Sturdee%20%28AV%201355%29">"Vernon Sturdee"</a> after him. He died on 25 May 1966 at the <a href="Repatriation%20General%20Hospital%2C%20Heidelberg">Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg</a>. He was accorded a funeral with full military honours, and cremated. Lieutenant General <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Sir Edmund Herring</a>, a boyhood friend from Melbourne Grammar, was principal pall bearer. Sturdee was survived by his wife, their daughter and one of their two sons. Before he died, he burned all his private papers. "I have done the job," he said. "It is over."

Deadalive

"Deadalive" (or "DeadAlive") is the fifteenth episode of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%208%29">eighth season</a> of the science fiction <a href="television%20series">television series</a> "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>". It was written by executive producers <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> and <a href="Frank%20Spotnitz">Frank Spotnitz</a>, and was directed by <a href="Tony%20Wharmby">Tony Wharmby</a>. "Deadalive" explores the series' alien <a href="Mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">mythology</a> <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a>. Following its North American premiere on April 1, 2001, it received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen household rating</a> of 7.3 and was watched by 12.4 million viewers. "Deadalive" garnered mixed reviews from television critics; while most were happy with the return of actor <a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>, some criticized the episode's <a href="plot%20hole">plot hole</a>s. It later won the show's last <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>, for <a href="53rd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">Outstanding Makeup</a>.

The season centers on <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) special agents <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) and her new partner <a href="John%20Doggett">John Doggett</a> (<a href="Robert%20Patrick">Robert Patrick</a>)—following the alien abduction and death of her former partner, <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, known as <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s. In this episode, agent Mulder is buried. After the body of alien abductee <a href="Billy%20Miles%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Billy Miles</a> (<a href="Zachary%20Ansley">Zachary Ansley</a>) revives before an autopsy, assistant director <a href="Walter%20Skinner">Walter Skinner</a> (<a href="Mitch%20Pileggi">Mitch Pileggi</a>) orders Mulder's body to be exhumed. When Mulder's body is uncovered, weak <a href="vital%20signs">vital signs</a> are discovered. Meanwhile, rogue FBI agent <a href="Alex%20Krycek">Alex Krycek</a> (<a href="Nicholas%20Lea">Nicholas Lea</a>) uses a <a href="nanobot">nanobot</a> infection in Skinner's blood as leverage to make him kill Scully's unborn child. Eventually, Mulder is revived and reunites with Scully.

"Deadalive" was a story milestone for the series, re-introducing Duchovny after his abduction by aliens planning to colonize Earth in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%207%29">seventh-season</a> finale "<a href="Requiem%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Requiem</a>". Spotnitz and Carter deliberately wrote and structured the episode in such a way so as to imply that Duchovny had been written out of the series. "Deadalive" featured several elaborate-make-up scenes, which head make-up effects artist Matthew Mungle was given only six days to complete. The episode has been analyzed for its themes of disease, suffering, healing, salvation and resurrection; Mulder seemingly rising from the dead has been seen as an allusion to the <a href="resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection of Jesus</a>.

In the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%207%29">seventh-season</a> finale "<a href="Requiem%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Requiem</a>", FBI special agent <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) was abducted by aliens. In the eighth-season premiere "<a href="Within%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Within</a>", <a href="John%20Doggett">John Doggett</a> (<a href="Robert%20Patrick">Robert Patrick</a>) took his place on the X-Files, and worked with <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) to find Mulder. In "<a href="This%20Is%20Not%20Happening">This Is Not Happening</a>", Scully, Doggett and FBI assistant director <a href="Walter%20Skinner">Walter Skinner</a> (<a href="Mitch%20Pileggi">Mitch Pileggi</a>) discovered several returned abductees. Although nearly all were in critical condition, a <a href="UFO%20religion">UFO cult</a>, led by the mysterious Absalom (<a href="Judson%20Scott">Judson Scott</a>), was using <a href="List%20of%20minor%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Jeremiah%20Smith">Jeremiah Smith</a>'s (<a href="Roy%20Thinnes">Roy Thinnes</a>) healing powers to treat the abductees. Scully headed to their compound, only to discover Mulder's deceased body in the woods.

Three months after Mulder's funeral, Doggett is offered a transfer from the X-Files. He realizes that if he leaves, the office will be closed, as Scully will soon be on <a href="maternity%20leave">maternity leave</a>. Meanwhile, a <a href="fishing%20trawler">fishing trawler</a> finds the decomposing body of <a href="Billy%20Miles%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Billy Miles</a> (<a href="Zachary%20Ansley">Zachary Ansley</a>)—an alien abductee who was taken at the same time as Mulder. When Miles revives on the autopsy table, Skinner, despite Doggett's objections, orders that Mulder's body be exhumed and brought to a hospital, fearing that he may have been <a href="buried%20alive">buried alive</a>. When the casket is opened, a decomposing Mulder, contrary to all scientific expectations, shows weak <a href="vital%20signs">vital signs</a>.

Meanwhile, Scully notices that Miles (now on <a href="life%20support">life support</a>) has two heartbeats. At the FBI, Kersh unsuccessfully tries to convince Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. A short while later, as Skinner walks down a hallway, rogue agent <a href="Alex%20Krycek">Alex Krycek</a> (<a href="Nicholas%20Lea">Nicholas Lea</a>) activates <a href="nanobot">nanobot</a>s that he had <a href="S.R.%20819">previously placed</a> in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains that he has a vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to <a href="Baby%20William">her baby</a> for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.

From her medical findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus is keeping the abductees alive long enough to cause a radical transformation to take place, similar to the one that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek in the parking lot of the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.

Later, Scully is sitting by Mulder's bedside when he regains consciousness. He stares blankly at Scully, and asks "Who are you?" At first, Scully thinks that Mulder does not remember her. However, she quickly realizes that he is actually playing a practical joke. They laugh, and Mulder asks, "Did anybody miss me?" Scully responds with tears. Later at the FBI, Kersh expresses his disappointment that Doggett did not take his advice to abandon Mulder's case and rescinds his offer to promote him. He indicates that he will continue to work on The X-Files with Scully and Mulder.

At the beginning of season seven, several cast and crew members felt it would be the show's last. Desiring closure if the show was cancelled, "X-Files" creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> brought back several characters from the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28pilot%20episode%29">series' pilot</a> for the season finale "<a href="Requiem%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Requiem</a>"; this included most notably Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley. After an <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%208%29">eighth season</a> of the show was confirmed, the mythology of the ongoing alien story arc for the series changed for both practical and artistic reasons. Former series lead <a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a> left full-time participation in the series after a lengthy lawsuit during the previous season. To replace him, the show's producers hired <a href="Robert%20Patrick">Robert Patrick</a>, although Duchovny eventually agreed to return for half of season eight's episodes. As such, "Deadalive" was one of the first episodes that Duchovny participated in full-time. Further, <a href="Frank%20Spotnitz">Frank Spotnitz</a>, executive producer and co-writer of "Deadalive", noted that the original mythology of the show had been "wrapped up" much earlier in "<a href="One%20Son">One Son</a>" and "<a href="Closure%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Closure</a>". To create a "new chapter" in the mythology, and to work around Duchovny's absence, the storyline for the eighth season focused largely on the search for Mulder in the first half and the introduction of Super Soldiers in the second. Due to the change in style and actors, Carter felt that the eighth season of "The X-Files" was the end of the "Mulder-Scully era".

Spotnitz wanted "Deadalive" to open in a way that would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He concluded that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that "the death of the hero [of the series] was shocking enough", but that no one expected "Deadalive" to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as <a href="Sheila%20Larken">Sheila Larken</a>, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in <a href="post-production">post-production</a>. Spotnitz later called the sequence "a fun scene to write and stage" and "a great tease".

On Duchovny's request, Spotnitz and Carter wrote a larger role for Skinner than usual, giving him the "<a href="moral%20dilemma">moral dilemma</a>" of whether or not to kill Scully's unborn child or Mulder. In the end, Spotnitz called the effects of his actions, particularly the aftermath of taking Mulder off life support, a "nice sort of unexpected turn". Scully's role in "Deadalive" was partly based on the 1954 film "<a href="Magnificent%20Obsession%20%281954%20film%29">Magnificent Obsession</a>", in which a young man's behavior causes him to accidentally blind a woman. To atone for this turn of events, he becomes a doctor to cure her. Spotnitz noted, "that movie was on my mind and not in a good way when we were imagining Scully in this operating room where Mulder was being worked on."

"Deadalive" was the second episode directed by Tony Wharmby, after the Spotnitz-penned "<a href="Via%20Negativa%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Via Negativa</a>". Spotnitz later praised the directing of "Deadalive" as "fantastic". The majority of the episode—like others from seasons six to nine—was filmed in and around the Los Angeles area. Spotnitz managed to secure sufficient funds to enable the fishing trawler scene to be filmed off the Los Angeles coast, a situation with which he was "very pleased". He also said that after the series' move from Vancouver following the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%205%29">fifth season</a>, the <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover%20Building">J. Edgar Hoover Building</a> set became more important to the show than before. For this reason, the scene in which Skinner collapses was filmed almost entirely on an FBI hallway set. This sequence recalls the sixth-season episode "<a href="S.R.%20819">S.R. 819</a>", which featured Skinner being poisoned with nanobots by Krycek.

Make-up effects artist Matthew Mungle was responsible for portraying the decomposition of Mulder's and Miles's bodies. Spotnitz was particularly impressed with Miles's autopsy scene, calling it "something new to do [in the] late stage of the game". Since human bodies which have decomposed in water become "grotesque[ly] ... disfigured", Miles's body was "a toned-down version of what the reality would be." To create the scene, plaster bandages were used to create a cast of the front and back of Ansley's body; these, in turn, were used to create a fiberglass cast. This was sculpted over with water clay to create the appearance of a bloated body. Afterwards, a mold of the clay was made and a body suit created with latex. As the project proceeded, Mungle sent photos to Carter, who gave final approval. In Miles's shower scene, a mix of "red goo", which included strawberry jam, was placed on Ansley's skin. Fake skin, created from thin pieces of <a href="Ethyl%20carbamate">urethane</a>, was then placed on top of this mixture and warm water was pumped through to create the illusion of shedding flesh. Mungle reportedly had only six days to complete the prosthetics for the episode. Mungle later noted that after being told what the scene would entail he asked, "if we can figure something out, could we show it on TV?" While the studio approved the footage, Spotnitz later called the sequence "awfully graphic"; he was surprised the sequence got past censors since it would be difficult to show in a <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system%23Ratings">PG-rated</a> film.

Due to Duchovny's contract, he was only available for shooting on certain days. Spotnitz commented on the irony of "paying all this money to get [Duchovny's] services for a limited time" only to have him spend most of the episode "in a hospital bed, semi-dead". He later lamented the limited access to Duchovny as it prevented the "most satisfying use of the actor or character". Some scenes featuring Mulder were filmed using different people. For instance, the scene in which Mulder is exhumed was filmed with a double who wore a mask of Duchovny's face. Head make-up artist Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf later said "It was brilliant, because nobody knew that." For the shots of the stunt double as well as of Duchovny later in the episode, she used egg whites and a <a href="Facial%23Facial%20mask">facial mask</a> to give Mulder's skin a "really cool, old, dried-up cracked skin effect."

"Deadalive", along with other eighth-season episodes, explores the themes of "human resurrection and salvation ... disease, suffering, and healing". These emerged in the season's premiere, "Within", when Scully is shown Mulder's tombstone. The arc would continue in "<a href="The%20Gift%20%28The%20X-Files%29">The Gift</a>", which explored the implications of Mulder's inoperable brain tumor and featured the resurrection of a temporarily deceased John Doggett. In "Deadalive", the theme of resurrection reappears in full force: Billy Miles is found dead but revives. Likewise, Mulder is buried for three months, but is brought back to life. This sub-theme would continue into the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%209%29">ninth season</a> in episodes such as "<a href="Audrey%20Pauley">Audrey Pauley</a>".

The episode is one of many to feature Mulder as a Christlike figure. In "We Want to Believe", Amy Donaldson writes that the episode is the most dramatic of Mulder's "multiple resurrections". She compares his resurrection to <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">Jesus's</a>, who Mulder "outdo[es]" by "staying in the grave for three months instead of simply three days." During Mulder's funeral the minister reads John 11:25–26: "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". According to scripture, Jesus spoke these words when he raised <a href="Lazarus%20of%20Bethany">Lazarus of Bethany</a> from the dead, and many biblical scholars note that the verse foreshadows his own resurrection. Previously, in the seventh-season's "<a href="Millennium%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Millennium</a>", the verse was used by a <a href="Necromancy">necromancer</a>, but for the wrong reason. The necromancer wanted to raise the dead by reciting the verse, but only their bodies returned as <a href="zombie">zombie</a>s. In "Deadalive", Mulder returns from the dead in both mind and body.

Donaldson also draws parallels between the eighth season of the show and the <a href="Gospels">Gospels</a>, and between the ninth season and the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>. In the Gospels, Jesus is brought back to life but then leaves his followers, allowing them to spread his message; this is recorded in Acts, the fifth book of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. In "The X-Files", Mulder follows a similar course. After returning to life in "Deadalive", he investigates several cases before disappearing at the beginning of season nine in "<a href="Nothing%20Important%20Happened%20Today">Nothing Important Happened Today</a>". During the ninth season, his quest is continued by Scully, Doggett and <a href="Monica%20Reyes">Monica Reyes</a>.

"Deadalive" premiered on American television on April 1, 2001. The episode earned a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen household rating</a> of 7.3 with an 11-percent share, meaning it was viewed by 7.3 percent of all television-equipped households, and 11 percent of those watching television. It was watched by 12.4 million viewers overall. It won for Outstanding Makeup For a Series at the <a href="53rd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">53rd Primetime Emmy Awards</a> in 2001; it would be the last Emmy win for "The X-Files". "Deadalive" was first released as a single-episode DVD in the United Kingdom on August 6, 2001 for <a href="DVD%20region%20code%23Region%20codes%20and%20countries">Region 2</a>. On November 4, 2003 the episode was released as part of the eighth season DVD box set. The episode was later included on "<a href="The%20X-Files%20Mythology%2C%20Volume%204%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Super%20Soldiers">The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers</a>", a DVD collection of episodes in the <a href="Colonist%20%28The%20X-Files%29%23%26quot%3BSuper%20Soldiers%26quot%3B">Super Soldiers</a> story arc.

The episode received mixed reviews; many critics praised the return of Fox Mulder, although others felt that the episode had various <a href="plot%20hole">plot hole</a>s and was overcomplicated. <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", gave "Deadalive" a full five stars and called its humor and simplistic plot the "icing on the cake." They praised its stylistic difference from the preceding episode, "This Is Not Happening", which they described as "atmospheric and doom-laden". The two called "Deadalive" a "slice of sci-fi hokum, with action scenes, bits of grisly horror [and] a reexamination of the show's mythology". Jessica Morgan from <a href="Television%20Without%20Pity">Television Without Pity</a> gave the episode an "A−" and wrote, "Never go away again, David! I take back everything bad I ever said about you! I love you as much as ever!"

Likewise George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the "<a href="Contra%20Costa%20Times">Contra Costa Times</a>" praised the on-screen return of characters such as Mulder and Krycek. They felt so many eighth-season episodes worked well because "Chris Carter seems to be taking an even more active role in the series that is most closely identified with him." Zack Handlen of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" awarded the episode a "B+" and wrote that, "it’s a measure of a show’s effectiveness to see how convincingly the writers can threaten a major character, and have that character’s subsequent survival not be a cheat", in regards to Mulder's resurrection. He applauded the fact that the episode is suspenseful, even though the ending has a certain inevitability. Handlen also positively commented on both Anderson's performance—although pointing out that she "is largely pushed to the side for the majority" of the episode—and Lea's reappearance, noting that "it's always fun to see Krycek". However, he argued that the conclusion "makes less sense the more you think about it", but that the final scene with Mulder and Scully "makes up for the contrivance."

Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from "<a href="Cinefantastique">CFQ</a>" gave the episode one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized its storyline, noting a number of plot holes—such as Mulder's survival for three months without food or water—and the fact that his body was neither autopsied nor embalmed. Tom Kessenich, in "Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files", called the plot "wooden and convoluted" and felt that it "set the stage for ... the countdown toward the end of Fox Mulder's time on "The X-Files"". However, he complimented Anderson on her "effective" performance.

"<a href="SFX%20%28magazine%29">SFX</a>" magazine ranked the episode as the sixth "Top 10 Resurrections", reasoning that it allowed Mulder to be around for the <a href="The%20Truth%20%28The%20X-Files%29">series finale</a> a year later. However, the magazine felt his return made "poor Robert Patrick’s Agent Doggett a bit superfluous", and that the plot was rather complicated. In a list comparing "<a href="Fringe%20%28TV%20series%29">Fringe</a>" episodes with those of the "X-Files", <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO Networks</a> writer Alex Zalben named "Deadalive" as the best resurrection story, beating out "Fringe"s "<a href="Unearthed%20%28Fringe%29">Unearthed</a>". Zalben cited the "emotional reunion at the end" as the deciding factor, though "both [episodes] kind of suck".

Museum of Bad Art

The Museum Of Bad Art (MOBA) is a privately owned museum whose stated aim is "to celebrate the labor of artists whose work would be displayed and appreciated in no other forum". It was originally in <a href="Dedham%2C%20Massachusetts">Dedham</a> with current branches in <a href="Somerville%2C%20Massachusetts">Somerville</a>, <a href="Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts">Brookline</a>, and <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Massachusetts">South Weymouth</a> in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. Its permanent collection includes over 700 pieces of "art too bad to be ignored", 25 to 35 of which are on public display at any one time.

MOBA was founded in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a painting he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection needed its own viewing space. The museum then moved to the basement of a theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: "While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst." To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators are not interested in displaying deliberate <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a>.

MOBA has been mentioned in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a>, featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. <a href="Deborah%20Solomon">Deborah Solomon</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a>" noted that the attention the Museum Of Bad Art receives is part of a wider trend of museums displaying "the best bad art". The museum has been criticized for being <a href="anti-art">anti-art</a>, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, "We are here to celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously."

The Museum Of Bad Art was established in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature piece—"Lucy in the Field with Flowers"—protruding from between two trash cans on a <a href="Roslindale%2C%20Massachusetts">Roslindale</a>-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited "Lucy" in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found. When Wilson acquired another "equally lovely" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled "The Opening of the Museum Of Bad Art".

Regular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in <a href="West%20Roxbury%2C%20Massachusetts">West Roxbury, Massachusetts</a>, as hundreds of people attended the receptions. The founders' initial attempt at dealing with their constrained exhibition space was to create the Virtual Museum Of Bad Art, a CD-ROM with a cast of 95 people that presented the MOBA art collection in a fictional imaginary museum. This fictional MOBA allowed the visitors not only to view the paintings but to go behind the scenes in the fictional museum.

Word of the museum's collection continued to spread until, according to "Permanent Interim Acting Director" Louise Reilly Sacco, "it got completely out of hand" when a group of senior citizens on a tour bus stopped to see it. In 1995 the display space was moved to the basement of the Dedham Community Theatre, a building with an aesthetic described in 2004 as "ramshackle". The museum in Dedham had no fixed operating hours, instead being open while the theater upstairs was open. As "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" notes, the art collection was appropriately placed "just outside the men's room", where sounds and smells carry to the collection and the constant flushing of the toilet "supposedly helps maintain a uniform humidity", according to the "<a href="South%20China%20Morning%20Post">South China Morning Post</a>".

In MOBA's early days, the museum hosted traveling shows; on one occasion the works were hung from trees in the woods on <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> for the "Art Goes Out the Window—The Gallery in the Woods". <a href="Aesthetics%20of%20music%23Bad%20music">Bad music</a> was played during the public viewings to complete the ambiance. In an exhibition titled "Awash in Bad Art", 18 pieces of art were covered in shrink wrap for "the world's first drive-thru museum and car wash". Marie Jackson, formerly the Director of Aesthetic Interpretation noted, "We didn't put any watercolors in there." A 2001 exhibition, "Buck Naked—Nothing But Nudes" featured all of the MOBA nudes hung in a local spa.

MOBA features its works in rotating collections. In 2003, "Freaks of Nature" focused on landscape artwork "gone awry". A 2006 exhibit titled "Hackneyed Portraits" was designed to "pick up some of the slack" when the <a href="David%20Hockney">David Hockney</a> show at Boston's <a href="Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston">Museum of Fine Arts</a> closed. MOBA unveiled its show "Nature Abhors a Vacuum and All Other Housework" in 2006; this format continues on the museum's website.

A second gallery opened in 2008 at the <a href="Somerville%20Theatre">Somerville Theatre</a> in <a href="Davis%20Square">Davis Square</a>, <a href="Somerville%2C%20Massachusetts">Somerville, Massachusetts</a>, where the collection was placed near both the women's and men's restrooms. Although the original gallery was free and open to the public, the second is free with admission to the theater or with a pass requested from the museum. Exhibitions titled "Bright Colors / Dark Emotions" and "Know What You Like / Paint How You Feel" have been held in the academic gallery at <a href="Montserrat%20College%20of%20Art">Montserrat College of Art</a> in <a href="Beverly%2C%20Massachusetts">Beverly, Massachusetts</a>. One of MOBA's goals is "to take bad art on the road", according to Sacco. Pieces from MOBA's collection have been on display in museums in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, <a href="Taipei">Taipei</a>, and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>.

In February 2009, MOBA announced a fundraiser to assist the <a href="Rose%20Art%20Museum">Rose Art Museum</a> at <a href="Brandeis%20University">Brandeis University</a>, which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the <a href="global%20financial%20crisis%20of%202008%E2%80%932009">global financial crisis of 2008–2009</a>, made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in <a href="Madoff%20investment%20scandal">Bernard Madoff's investment scheme</a>. Current MOBA curator and <a href="Balloon%20modelling">balloon artist</a>/musician Michael Frank placed "Studies in Digestion"—a four-panel piece showing four renditions of the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on <a href="eBay">eBay</a> for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99. It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.

In 2010, the museum opened a third location in the offices of the Brookline Interactive Group.

In December 2012, the branch at the Dedham Community Theater closed to convert the space into a screening room. Another branch has since opened at the New England Wildlife Center in <a href="South%20Weymouth%2C%20Massachusetts">South Weymouth</a>.

The loss of two MOBA works to theft has drawn media attention and enhanced the museum's stature. In 1996, the painting "Eileen", by R. Angelo Le, vanished from MOBA. "Eileen" was acquired from the trash by Wilson, and features a rip in the canvas where someone slashed it with a knife even before the museum acquired it, "adding an additional element of drama to an already powerful work", according to MOBA.

The museum offered a reward of $6.50 for the return of "Eileen", and although MOBA donors later increased that reward to $36.73, the work remained unrecovered for many years. The <a href="Boston%20Police%20Department">Boston Police</a> listed the crime as "larceny, other", and Sacco was reported saying she was unable to establish a link between the disappearance of "Eileen" and a notorious heist at Boston's famed <a href="Isabella%20Stewart%20Gardner%20Museum">Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</a> that occurred in 1990. In 2006–10 years after "Eileen" was stolen—MOBA was contacted by the purported thief demanding a $5,000 ransom for the painting; no ransom was paid, but it was returned anyway.

Prompted by the theft of "Eileen", MOBA staff installed a fake video camera over a sign at their Dedham branch reading (in Comic Sans): "Warning. This gallery is protected by a fake security camera". Despite this deterrent, in 2004 Rebecca Harris' "Self Portrait as a Drainpipe" was removed from the wall and replaced with a ransom note demanding $10, although the thief neglected to include any contact information. Soon after its disappearance the painting was returned, with a $10 donation. Curator Michael Frank speculates that the thief had difficulty <a href="Fence%20%28criminal%29">fencing</a> the portrait because "reputable institutions refuse to negotiate with criminals."

Although the museum's motto is "Art too bad to be ignored", MOBA holds rigorous standards as to what they will accept. According to Marie Jackson, "Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards." As stated in the introduction to "The Museum Of Bad Art: Masterworks", the primary attribute of an "<a href="Work%20of%20art">objet d'art</a>" to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should "[result] in a compelling image", or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an "Oh my God" quality.

An important criterion for inclusion is that a painting or sculpture must not be boring. Michael Frank says they are not interested in commercial works like "<a href="Dogs%20Playing%20Poker">Dogs Playing Poker</a>": "We collect things made in earnest, where people attempted to make art and something went wrong, either in the execution or in the original premise." Montserrat College of Art used MOBA's exhibition as a demonstration to its students that "sincerity is still important, and pureness of intent is valid".

MOBA accepts unsolicited works if they meet its standards. Frequently, curators consider works by artists who display an intensity or emotion in the art that they are unable to reconcile with their level of skill. The museum dedicated a show to "relentless creativity" in an exhibition titled "I Just Can't Stop" that was covered by local news and <a href="CNN">CNN</a>. Other artists are clearly technically proficient, but attempted an experiment that did not end well. Michael Frank has compared some of the works at MOBA with <a href="outsider%20art">outsider art</a> or art brut; some MOBA artists' works are also included in other galleries' outsider collections. Dean Nimmer, a professor at the <a href="Massachusetts%20College%20of%20Art">Massachusetts College of Art</a> (also holding the title of MOBA's Executive Director of Good Taste), noted the parallels between the Museum Of Bad Art's standards and those of other institutions: "They take the model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria to acceptance for bad work ... [Their rules] are very similar to a gallery or museum that says 'Well, our area is really installation art or realist paintings or neo-post-modern abstractions.

MOBA does not collect art created by children, or art traditionally perceived as lesser in quality, such as <a href="black%20velvet%20painting">black velvet painting</a>s, <a href="Paint%20by%20number">paint-by-numbers</a>, <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a>, or factory-produced art—including works specifically created for tourists. Curators are also not interested in crafts such as <a href="Rug%20making%23Hooking">latch hook rug</a> kits. MOBA curators suggest that more appropriate venues for such works would be the "Museum of Questionable Taste, The International Schlock Collection, or the National Treasury of Dubious Home Decoration".

The Museum Of Bad Art has been accused of being anti-art, or taking works that were sincerely rendered and mocking them. However, Scott Wilson insists that a work of art accepted into MOBA is a celebration of the artist's enthusiasm. Marie Jackson reiterated this thought, saying "I think it's a great encouragement to people... who want to create [and] are held back by fear, and when they see these pieces, they realize there's nothing to be afraid of—just go for it." Louise Reilly Sacco agreed, stating, "If we're making fun of something, it's the art community, not the artists. But this is a real museum. It's 10 years. It's 6,000 people on a mailing list. It's recognition all over the world." Curators insist that artists whose works are selected by MOBA enjoy the attention and that it is a <a href="Win-win%20game">win-win</a>; the museum gains another work of art, and the artist receives exposure in a museum. A 1997 article in "<a href="The%20Chicago%20Tribune">The Chicago Tribune</a>" stated that none of the 10 to 15 artists who had stepped forward to acknowledge their work in MOBA had been upset.

Many of the works in MOBA are donated, often by the artists themselves. Others come from yard sales or <a href="thrift%20stores">thrift stores</a>; the Trash Collectors Union in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> has donated works rescued from imminent demise. Occasionally a painting may be purchased; at one time MOBA's policy was not to spend more than $6.50 on any piece. More recently, twice and even three times that amount has been paid for an exceptional work. Those pieces not retained by the museum are included in a "Rejection Collection" that may be sold at auction. In the past, some proceeds went to the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> for providing so many of MOBA's pieces; the museum itself usually benefits from most auctions.

Each painting or sculpture MOBA exhibits is accompanied by a brief description of the medium, size, name of the artist, as well as how the piece was acquired, and an analysis of the work's possible intention or symbolism. "<a href="Museums%20Journal">Museums Journal</a>" noted that the discussion accompanying each work would most likely have most visitors reduced "to hysterics". The captions—described as "distinctly tongue-in-cheek commentaries" by David Mutch of the "<a href="Christian%20Science%20Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a>"—were primarily written by Marie Jackson, until the "dissolution of the MOBA interpretative staff"; the task was then taken over by Michael Frank and Louise Reilly Sacco.

Many of MOBA's works generate extensive discourse from visitors. "Lucy in the Field with Flowers" (oil on canvas by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite with the news media and patrons. As the first work acquired by the museum, "Lucy" is "a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found "Lucy" or she found him.

Kate Swoger of "<a href="The%20Gazette%20%28Montreal%29">The Montreal Gazette</a>" called "Lucy" a "gorgeous mistake", describing her thus: "an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other". Author <a href="Cash%20Peters">Cash Peters</a>, using less florid language, summarized it as "the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass".

MOBA's statement about "Lucy" reads: "The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face—every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out 'masterpiece'." "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the "endless layers of mysteries" the image offers: "What is <a href="Norman%20Mailer">Norman Mailer</a>'s head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or <a href="F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16s</a> skimming the hills?"

"Lucy" granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, became a fan of MOBA after seeing the portrait in a newspaper. She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure what happened to her arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from."

"Sunday on the Pot With George" (acrylic on canvas by John Gedraitis; donated by Jim Schulman) has been deemed "iconic" by Bella English of "The Boston Globe", who assures the work is "100 percent guaranteed to make you burst out laughing". Wilson has pointed to "George" as an example of a technically well-executed piece of art using a subject not usually seen rendered in paint.

Many admirers of the first work donated to MOBA are hypnotized by the image of a portly man wearing "Y-front" underwear while sitting on a chamber pot, in <a href="pointillist">pointillist</a> <a href="impressionism">impressionism</a> similar to the style of <a href="Georges%20Seurat">Georges Seurat</a>. One critic speculates the pointillist style in "George" may have been acquired "from watching too much TV". The title refers to the <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> musical "<a href="Sunday%20in%20the%20Park%20with%20George">Sunday in the Park with George</a>", which contains a dramatic recreation of Seurat's painting "<a href="A%20Sunday%20Afternoon%20on%20the%20Island%20of%20La%20Grande%20Jatte">A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte</a>". Author Amy Levin suggests that "George" is a pastiche of Seurat's painting. The subject of this painting has been "tentatively identified" by the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Improbable%20Research">Annals of Improbable Research</a>"—the creators of the <a href="Ig%20Nobel">Ig Nobel</a> award—as <a href="John%20Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</a>, former <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">United States Attorney General</a>.

A visitor was so moved by "George" he felt compelled to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing "Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took in this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing "George" brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept." MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: "Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching around the edge of the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet."

In contrast to the pointillist impressionism of "George", the museum also features a "fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism", according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's "Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt" (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), inspired this description by MOBA: "We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt." MOBA enjoys the mystery as much as any other aspect of art, however.

Newman, a professional artist from Minneapolis, responded to the curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure how to use a canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a <a href="dachshund">dachshund</a>, she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a <a href="grass%20skirt">hula skirt</a> she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying "I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you."

Travel writer Cash Peters identifies six characteristics common to many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a> and <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>, masters of landscapes, who "could probably paint with their eyes shut" to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their eyes shut, as skies are often painted in any color but blue, <a href="flora">flora</a> are created without reference to any existing plant organisms, and <a href="fauna">fauna</a> appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply <a href="perspective%20%28visual%29">perspective</a> inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work. Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor "mixed media": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition.

Since late 2008, MOBA has been experimenting with allowing the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be "interpretated". The "Guest Interpretator's Collection" is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and these interpretations are added as each contest ends. A professor at <a href="Boston%20University">Boston University</a> offered his thoughts: "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests a commitment to the abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need to pick up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!"

The Museum Of Bad Art has been mentioned in hundreds of international publications, as well as in Boston-area travel guides highlighting offbeat attractions. It has inspired similar collections or events in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>.

<a href="Commedia%20Beauregard">Commedia Beauregard</a>, a theatre company whose mission focuses on translation, was inspired by MOBA's mission to create their Master Works series of short play festivals. The company commissioned six playwrights to write short plays based on MOBA artworks. "Master Works: The MOBA Plays" was originally performed in January and February 2009 in <a href="Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>. The plays were based on the MOBA pieces "Mana Lisa", "Invasion of the Office Zombies", "My Left Foot", "Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt", "Gina's Demons", and "Lulli, Fowl and Gravestone". After moving to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, the company again produced "The MOBA Plays" in March and April 2011, using three of the original plays and translating three new paintings.

Museum visitors can sign a guest book, and leave comments. One Canadian visitor wrote: "This collection is disturbing, yet I can't seem to look away...Just like a hideous car accident." Another visitor warns: "Her nipples follow you around the room. Creepy!"

Response to MOBA's opening and continued success is, for some, evocative of the way art is treated in society. MOBA works have been described as "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of <a href="Ed%20Wood">Ed Wood</a>. Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In "Gullible's Travels", Cash Peters contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a>'s <a href="J.%20Paul%20Getty%20Museum">Getty Museum</a>; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.

In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco participated in a panel discussion with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in "Architecture Boston". She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, "Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, to have their own opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly ... frees us." Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to "fix" the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.
Jason Kaufman, a <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a> professor who teaches the sociology of culture, wrote that MOBA is part of a social trend he calls "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum Of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles." Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art. The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in <a href="Arlington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a>, that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, "If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?"

<a href="Deborah%20Solomon">Deborah Solomon</a>, in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a>", asserted that MOBA's success reflects a trend in modern art among artists and audiences. The arrival of <a href="abstraction">abstraction</a> and <a href="modern%20art">modern art</a> in the early 20th century made art appreciation more esoteric and less accessible for the general community, showing that "the American public ... think[s] of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre of experts whose taste and rituals [seem] as mysterious as those of Byzantine priests." Bad art is in vogue, as a movement that rejects the anti-sentimentalism that marked earlier disdain for artists such as <a href="Norman%20Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> or <a href="Gustave%20Moreau">Gustave Moreau</a>, according to Solomon. Garen Daly, a MOBA fan on several Boston-area <a href="Arts%20council">art councils</a>, stated in 1995, "I go to a lot of openings, and sometimes they're pretty damn stuffy." Not only does the Museum Of Bad Art offer different fare for the eyes, but instead of the wine and cheese that is provided for most museum and art gallery visitors, a MOBA show provides its patrons with <a href="Kool-Aid">Kool-Aid</a>, <a href="Fluffernutter">Fluffernutter</a>s and <a href="cheese%20puffs">cheese puffs</a>.

The Museum Of Bad Art has been used in academic studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in "<a href="Perspectives%20on%20Psychological%20Science%23Journals">Perspectives on Psychological Science</a>", researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make "gut" judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art. The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing "Very Attractive" and "Very Unattractive". The study found that those who reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings. Study participants identified and rated MoMA art higher quality, but those who used conscious reasoning did not find MoMA art more attractive than those who rated with "gut" judgments. Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that people who make quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy.

In another study that appeared in the "<a href="British%20Psychological%20Society">British Journal of Psychology</a>", researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from <a href="ArtCyclopedia">ArtCyclopedia</a> by artists such as <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>, <a href="Georgia%20O%27Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>, and <a href="Georges-Pierre%20Seurat">Georges-Pierre Seurat</a>, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.

Temple of Eshmun

The Temple of Eshmun () is an ancient <a href="place%20of%20worship">place of worship</a> dedicated to <a href="Eshmun">Eshmun</a>, the <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n god of healing. It is located near the <a href="Awali%20%28river%29">Awali river</a>, northeast of <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a> in southwestern <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. The site was occupied from the 7th century BC to the 8th century AD, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king <a href="Eshmunazar%20II%20sarcophagus">Eshmunazar II</a> in the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid era</a> ( 529–333 BC) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by <a href="Bodashtart">Bodashtart</a>, <a href="Yatan-milk">Yatan-milk</a> and later monarchs. Because the continued expansion spanned many centuries of alternating independence and foreign <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a>, the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences.

The sanctuary consists of an <a href="esplanade">esplanade</a> and a grand court limited by a huge <a href="limestone">limestone</a> terrace wall that supports a monumental <a href="podium">podium</a> which was once topped by Eshmun's Graeco-Persian style <a href="marble">marble</a> temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual <a href="Ritual%20purification">ablution</a> basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern <a href="Awali%20%28river%29">Awali</a>) and from the sacred "Ydll" spring; these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of Eshmun. The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician texts</a>, providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon.

The Eshmun Temple was improved during the early <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as <a href="Early%20Christianity">Christianity</a> replaced <a href="paganism">paganism</a> and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local <a href="Treasure%20hunting">treasure hunters</a> who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. <a href="Maurice%20Dunand">Maurice Dunand</a>, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the <a href="Lebanese%20Civil%20War">Lebanese Civil War</a> in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of <a href="Israel">Israel</a> from <a href="Southern%20Lebanon">Southern Lebanon</a>, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> tentative list.

Eshmun was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the <a href="Ancient%20Canaanite%20religion">Phoenician pantheon</a> and the main male divinity of <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>n deity <a href="Tammuz%20%28deity%29">Tammuz</a>. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes.

The myth of Eshmun was related by the sixth century Syrian <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonist philosopher</a> <a href="Damascius">Damascius</a> and ninth century <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch of Constantinople</a>, <a href="Photios%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Photius</a>. They recount that Eshmun, a young man from <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, was hunting in the woods when <a href="Astarte">Astarte</a> saw him and was stricken by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he <a href="Emasculation">emasculated</a> himself with an <a href="axe">axe</a> and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of <a href="heaven">heaven</a>.

From a historical perspective, the first written mention of Eshmun goes back to 754 BC, the date of the signing of the treaty between <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n king <a href="Ashur-nirari%20V">Ashur-nirari V</a> and Mati'el, king of <a href="Arpad%2C%20Syria">Arpad</a>; Eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty.

Eshmun was identified with <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a> as a result of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from <a href="Amrit">Amrit</a> and <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a> from the third century BC. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the <a href="Awali%20%28river%29">Awali</a> river which was dubbed "Asclepius fluvius", and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.

In the 9th century BC, the <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n king <a href="Ashurnasirpal%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Ashurnasirpal II</a> conquered <a href="Mount%20Lebanon">the Lebanon</a> mountain range and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along with every other <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n city. These payments stimulated Sidon's search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion, which peaked in the 8th century BC.
When Assyrian king <a href="Sargon%20II">Sargon II</a> died in 705 BC, the Sidonian king <a href="Luli">Luli</a> joined with the <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptians</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> in an unsuccessful rebellion against Assyrian rule, but was forced to flee to <a href="Kition">Kition</a> (modern <a href="Larnaca">Larnaca</a> in Cyprus) with the arrival of the Assyrian army headed by <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a>, Sargon II's son and successor. Sennacherib instated <a href="Ittobaal">Ittobaal</a> on the throne of Sidon and reimposed the annual tribute.
When <a href="Abdi-Milkutti">Abdi-Milkutti</a> ascended to Sidon's throne in 680 BC, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king <a href="Esarhaddon">Esarhaddon</a> laid siege to the city. Abdi-Milkutti was captured and beheaded in 677 BC after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon was stripped of its territory, which was awarded to <a href="Baal%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Baal I</a>, the king of rival <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> and loyal <a href="vassal">vassal</a> to Esarhaddon. Baal I and <a href="Esarhaddon%27s%20Treaty%20with%20Ba%27al%20of%20Tyre">Esarhaddon signed a treaty</a> in 675 in which Eshmun's name features as one of the deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.

Sidon returned to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13 years (586–573 BC) by the <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>n king <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Nebuchadnezzar II</a>. Nevertheless, the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>. Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia's chief city in the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> (529–333 BC). During this period, <a href="Xerxes%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Xerxes I</a> awarded king Eshmunazar II with the <a href="Sharon%20plain">Sharon plain</a> for employing Sidon's fleet in his service during the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a>.

Eshmunazar II displayed his new-found wealth by constructing numerous temples to Sidonian divinities. Inscriptions found on the king's <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> reveal that he and his mother, Amashtarte, built temples to the gods of Sidon, including the Temple of Eshmun by the "Ydll source near the cistern".

As two series of inscriptions on the foundations of the monumental podium attest, construction of the sanctuary's podium did not begin until the reign of King <a href="Bodashtart">Bodashtart</a>. The first set of inscriptions bears the name of Bodashtart alone, while the second contains his name and that of the crown prince Yatan-milk. A Phoenician inscription, located upstream from the temple, that dates to the 14th year of Bodashtart's reign, alludes to water adduction works from the Awali river to the "Ydll" source that was used for <a href="ritual%20purification">ritual purification</a> at the temple.

The Eshmun sanctuary was damaged by an earthquake in the fourth century BC, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium.

The temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a> during the early Roman Empire and until the advent of Christianity, when the cult of Eshmun was banned during the <a href="Persecution%20of%20pagans%20in%20the%20late%20Roman%20Empire">Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire</a> and a Christian church was built at the temple site across the <a href="Roman%20roads">Roman street</a> from the podium. Remnants and mosaic floors of a <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> church can still be seen on the site.

A Roman colonnade was built in the third century, probably by emperor <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a>, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of <a href="Phoenicia%20under%20Roman%20rule">Phoenicia under Roman rule</a>. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a <a href="nymphaeum">nymphaeum</a> with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain.

Another earthquake hit Sidon around 570 AD; <a href="Antoninus%20of%20Piacenza%20%28pilgrim%29">Antoninus of Piacenza</a>, an Italian Christian pilgrim, described the city as partly in ruins. For many years after the disappearance of the cult of Eshmun, the sanctuary site was used as a quarry: Emir <a href="Fakhr-al-Din%20II">Fakhr-al-Din II</a>, for example, used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century.

The site later fell into oblivion until the 19th century

Between 1737 and 1742, <a href="Richard%20Pococke">Richard Pococke</a>, an English <a href="Anthropology">anthropologist</a>, toured the Middle East and wrote of what he thought were ruins of <a href="defensive%20wall">defensive wall</a>s built with stone blocks near the Awali river. When the French <a href="Oriental%20studies">orientalist</a> <a href="Ernest%20Renan">Ernest Renan</a> visited the area in 1860, he noticed that the Awali bridge <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s were built of finely <a href="Rustication%20%28architecture%29">rusticated</a> blocks that originated from an earlier structure. He also noted in his report, <a href="Mission%20de%20Ph%C3%A9nicie%20%281865%E2%80%931874%29">"Mission de Phénicie"</a>, that a local treasure hunter told him of a large edifice near the Awali bridge.

In 1900, local clandestine treasure hunters digging at the Eshmun Temple site haphazardly discovered inscriptions carved onto the temple's walls. This discovery stirred the interest of Theodore Macridy, curator of the <a href="Istanbul%20Archaeology%20Museums">Museum of Constantinople</a>, who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903. Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904. In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who surveyed the temple complex. The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD.

During the <a href="Lebanese%20Civil%20War">Lebanese Civil War</a> and the <a href="South%20Lebanon%20conflict%20%281985%E2%80%932000%29">Israeli occupation of South Lebanon (1985–2000)</a>, the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth; it was cleared and recovered its former condition after the Israeli withdrawal. Today the Eshmun sanctuary can be visited all year round and free of charge, it is accessible from an <a href="Interchange%20%28road%29">exit ramp</a> off the main Southern Lebanon highway near Sidon's northern entrance. The site holds a particular <a href="archaeology">archaeological</a> importance since it is the best preserved Phoenician site in Lebanon; it was added to the <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage</a> Tentative List's Cultural category on , 1996.

In literature, the temple of Eshmun figures in Nabil Saleh's 2009 novel, "The Curse of <a href="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>" as the setting where Bomilcar falls in love and rescues princess Chiboulet from the evil design of one of the temple's priests.

A number of ancient texts mention the Eshmun Temple and its location. The <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician</a> inscriptions on the <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> of Eshmunazar II, a Sidonian king, commemorate the construction of a "house" for the "holy prince" Eshmun by the king and his mother, queen Amashtart, at the "Ydll source by the cistern".
<a href="Dionysius%20Periegetes">Dionysius Periegetes</a>, an ancient <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="travel%20writer">travel writer</a>, identified the <a href="Eshmun">Eshmun</a> temple by the Bostrenos River, and Antonin de Plaisance, a 6th-century AD <a href="Italians">Italian</a> <a href="Christian%20pilgrimage">pilgrim</a> recorded the shrine as near the river Asclepius fluvius.<a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> and other Sidonian sources describe the sanctuary and its surrounding "sacred forests" of <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a>, the Hellenized name of Eshmun, in written texts.

Located about south of <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> and northeast of Sidon, the Eshmun Temple sits on the southern bank of the modern <a href="Awali%20%28river%29">Awali river</a>, previously referred to as Bostrenos or Asclepius fluvius in ancient text. Citrus groves, known as "Bustan el-Sheikh" (, the grove of the <a href="Sheikh">Sheikh</a>), occupy the ancient "sacred forests" of Asclepius and are a favorite summer picnic location for locals.

Built under <a href="History%20of%20Lebanon%20under%20Babylonian%20rule">Babylonian rule</a> (605–539 BC), the oldest monument at the site is a <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a>al building resembling a <a href="ziggurat">ziggurat</a> that includes an access ramp to a water cistern. Fragments of marble column bases with <a href="Torus">Torus</a> moldings and facetted columns found east of the podium are also attributed to the Babylonian era.

The pyramidal structure was superimposed during <a href="History%20of%20Lebanon%20under%20Persian%20rule">Persian</a> rule by a massive <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> podium constructed from heavily bossed limestone blocks that measured more than across by thick, which were laid down in courses high. The podium stands high, runs into the hillside, and boasts a wide façade. The terrace atop of the podium was once covered by a Greco-Persian style marble temple probably built by <a href="Ionia">Ionic</a> artisans around 500 BC. The marble temple has been reduced to a few remaining stone fragments due to theft.

During the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a>, the sanctuary was extended from the base of the podium across the valley. To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, , dating to the 4th century BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone throne carved of a single block of <a href="granite">granite</a> in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a> figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess <a href="Ashtart">Astarte</a>, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th-century BC chapel—centered on a bull <a href="protome">protome</a> topped <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capital</a>—that remains preserved at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Beirut">National Museum of Beirut</a>.
Widely known as the "Tribune of Eshmun" because of its shape, the altar of Eshmun is a white marble structure dating to the 4th century BC. It is long by wide and tall. Unearthed in 1963 by Maurice Dunand, it stands on a <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="Socle%20%28architecture%29">socle</a>plated with marble blocks that rest against a retaining wall. The altar is adorned with <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Hellenistic style</a> <a href="relief">relief</a> sculptures and is framed by decorative <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">moldings</a>, one of which divides the altar into two distinct <a href="Register%20%28sculpture%29">registers</a> of symmetrical composition. The upper register portrays 18 Greek deities, including two charioteers surrounding the Greek god <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, who is depicted playing a <a href="cithara">cithara</a> (a type of <a href="lyre">lyre</a>). The lower register honors <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, who leads his "<a href="Thiasus">thiasos</a>" (his ecstatic revenue) in a dance to the music of pipe and cithara players. The Tribune is displayed at the National Museum of Beirut.

Northeast of the site, another 3rd century BC temple stands adjacent to the Astarte chapel. Its façade is built with large limestone blocks and displays a two-register relief decoration illustrating a <a href="Bacchanalia">drunken revelry</a> in honor of <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, the Greek god of wine. Among the temple reliefs, one shows a man attempting to seize a large rooster which was the common sacrificial animal for Eshmun-Asclepius.

The Eshmun Temple complex comprises an elaborate <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic installation</a> channeling water from "Ydll" spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals, a series of retaining basins, sacred ablution basins and paved pools. This system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in Phoenician therapeutic cults.

Later vestiges date from the <a href="History%20of%20Lebanon%20under%20Roman%20rule">Roman epoch</a> and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns bordering the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> also built a monumental staircase adorned with <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> patterns that leads to the top of the podium. To the right of the Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a <a href="nymphaeum">nymphaeum</a> with <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niches</a> where statues of the <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the <a href="Maenads">Maenads</a>. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a <a href="Roman%20villa">Roman villa</a>; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the <a href="Season">four seasons</a>. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic <a href="altar">altar</a>, also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations.

Eshmun's cult enjoyed a particular importance at Sidon as he was the chief deity after 500 BC. Aside from the extramural sanctuary at Bustan el-Sheikh, Eshmun also had a temple within the city. The extramural Eshmun Temple was associated with purification and healing; ritual lustral ablutions were performed in the sanctuary's sacred basins supplemented by running water from the Asclepius River and the "Ydll" spring water which was considered to have a sacred character and therapeutic quality.
The healing attributions of Eshmun were combined with his divine consort Astarte's <a href="fertility">fertilizing</a> powers; the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the Eshmun sanctuary. Pilgrims from all over the ancient world flocked to the Eshmun Temple leaving <a href="Votive%20offering">votive</a> traces of their devotion and proof of their cure. There is evidence that from the 3rd century BC onwards there have been attempts to Hellenize the cult of Eshmun and to associate him with his Greek counterpart Asclepius, but the sanctuary retained its curative function.

Apart from the large decorative elements, carved friezes and mosaics which were left <a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>, many artifacts were recovered and moved from the Eshmun Temple to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Beirut">national museum</a>, the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> or are in possession of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities. Some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed <a href="ostracon">ostraca</a> unearthed by Dunand providing rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing in the Phoenician mainland. One of the recovered ostracon bears the <a href="Theophoric%20name">theophoric</a> Phoenician name "grtnt" which suggests that veneration of the lunar-goddess <a href="Tanit">Tanit</a> occurred in Sidon.

A number of fragmented votive life-size sculptures of little children lying on their side and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among the best known of these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a <a href="Kouros">Kouros</a> dating from the 6th century BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.

Among the notable finds is a golden plaque showing <a href="Rod%20of%20Asclepius">a snake curling on a staff</a>, a Hellenic symbol of Eshmun. and a <a href="granite">granite</a> <a href="altar">altar</a> bearing the name of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> <a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> <a href="Achoris">Achoris</a> uncovered in the Eshmun sanctuary. This gift attests to the good relations between the Pharaoh and the kings of Sidon.

The repute of the sanctuary was far reaching. Cypriot pilgrims from <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a> left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble <a href="stele">stele</a> inscribed both in Greek and <a href="Cypriot%20syllabary">Cypriot syllabary</a> at Astarte's shrine; this stele is now in the custody of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities.

Treasure hunters have sought out the Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 artifacts bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site found their way to <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>ine <a href="Antiquities%20trade">antiquities markets</a> where they stirred the interest of the <a href="Ottoman%20empire">Ottoman</a> authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs.
During the civil war, upon a request from then Lebanese director general of antiquities <a href="Maurice%20Chehab">Maurice Chehab</a>, Maurice Dunand moved more than 2000 artifacts from Sidon to a subterranean chamber at the <a href="Byblos%20Castle">Byblos crusader castle</a>, north of Beirut. In 1981, the depot was looted and around 600 sculptures and architectural elements were stolen and smuggled out of Lebanon. Rolf Stucky, ex-director of the Institute of Classical Archeology of <a href="Basel">Basel</a> affirmed during a conference in Beirut in the successful identification and return of eight sculptures to the Lebanese national museum.

GRB 970508

GRB 970508 was a <a href="gamma-ray%20burst">gamma-ray burst</a> (GRB) detected on May 8, 1997, at 21:42 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>; it is historically important as the second GRB (after <a href="GRB%20970228">GRB 970228</a>) with a detected afterglow at other wavelengths, the first to have a direct redshift measurement of the afterglow, and the first to be detected at radio wavelengths. 

A gamma-ray burst is a highly <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> flash associated with an explosion in a distant galaxy and producing <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s, the most energetic form of <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>, and often followed by a longer-lived "afterglow" emitted at longer wavelengths (<a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>, <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>, <a href="visible%20light">optical</a>, <a href="infrared">infrared</a>, and <a href="radio%20waves">radio</a>).

GRB 970508 was detected by the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor on the Italian–Dutch <a href="X-ray%20astronomy">X-ray astronomy</a> satellite <a href="BeppoSAX">BeppoSAX</a>. Astronomer <a href="Mark%20Metzger">Mark Metzger</a> determined that GRB 970508 occurred at least 6 billion <a href="light%20year">light year</a>s from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>; this was the first measurement of the distance to a gamma-ray burst.

Until this burst, astronomers had not reached a consensus regarding how far away GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, but are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at <a href="Physical%20cosmology">cosmological</a> distances and are extremely energetic. Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive, the distance measurement unequivocally placed the source of the GRB outside the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, effectively ending the debate.

GRB 970508 was also the first burst with an observed <a href="radio%20frequency">radio frequency</a> afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer <a href="Dale%20Frail">Dale Frail</a> calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. This provided strong evidence that GRBs are <a href="Theory%20of%20relativity">relativistically</a> expanding explosions.

A gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a highly <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> flash of <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s—the most energetic form of <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>. GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the <a href="Vela%20satellites">Vela satellites</a> (a series of spacecraft designed to detect nuclear explosions in space). The initial burst is often followed by a longer-lived "afterglow" emitted at longer wavelengths (<a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>, <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>, <a href="optical">optical</a>, <a href="infrared">infrared</a>, and <a href="radio">radio</a>). The first GRB afterglow to be discovered was the X-ray afterglow of <a href="GRB%20970228">GRB 970228</a>, which was detected by <a href="BeppoSAX">BeppoSAX</a>, an Italian–Dutch satellite originally designed to study X-rays.

On Thursday May 8, 1997, at 21:42 UTC, BeppoSAX's Gamma Ray Burst Monitor registered a gamma-ray burst that lasted approximately 15 seconds. It was also detected by <a href="Ulysses%20%28spacecraft%29">Ulysses</a>, a robotic space probe designed to study the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, and by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the <a href="Compton%20Gamma%20Ray%20Observatory">Compton Gamma Ray Observatory</a>. The burst also occurred within the field of view of one of BeppoSAX's two <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> Wide Field Cameras. Within a few hours, the BeppoSAX team localized the burst to an error box—a small area around the specific position to account for the <a href="Measurement%20uncertainty">error</a> in the position—with a diameter of approximately 10 <a href="arcminute">arcminute</a>s.
After a rough position of the burst had been determined, <a href="Enrico%20Costa%20%28physicist%29">Enrico Costa</a> of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer <a href="Dale%20Frail">Dale Frail</a> at the <a href="National%20Radio%20Astronomy%20Observatory">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a>'s <a href="Very%20Large%20Array">Very Large Array</a>. Frail began making observations at a <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of 20 centimeters at 01:30 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer <a href="Stanislav%20Djorgovski">Stanislav Djorgovski</a>, who was working with the <a href="Hale%20telescope">Hale telescope</a>. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the <a href="Digitized%20Sky%20Survey">Digitized Sky Survey</a>, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a> observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.

The following evening Djorgovski again observed the region. He compared the images from both nights but the error box contained no objects that had decreased in luminosity between May 8 and May 9. Metzger noticed one object that had increased in luminosity, but he assumed it was a <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a> rather than the GRB afterglow. <a href="Titus%20Galama">Titus Galama</a> and <a href="Paul%20Groot">Paul Groot</a>, members of a research team in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> led by <a href="Jan%20van%20Paradijs">Jan van Paradijs</a>, compared images taken by the <a href="WIYN%20Telescope">WIYN Telescope</a> on May 8 and the <a href="William%20Herschel%20Telescope">William Herschel Telescope</a> on May 9. They were also unable to find any light sources which had faded during that time.

After discovering the burst's X-ray afterglow, the BeppoSAX team provided a more accurate localization, and what Metzger had assumed to be a variable star was still present in this smaller error box. Both the Caltech team and the Amsterdam team were hesitant to publish any conclusions on the variable object. On May 10 <a href="Howard%20Bond">Howard Bond</a> of the <a href="Space%20Telescope%20Science%20Institute">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> published his discovery, which was later confirmed to be the burst's optical afterglow.

On the night between May 10 and May 11, 1997, Metzger's colleague <a href="Charles%20Steidel">Charles Steidel</a> recorded the <a href="spectrum">spectrum</a> of the variable object at the <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">W. M. Keck Observatory</a>. He then sent the data to Metzger, who after identifying a system of <a href="absorption%20lines">absorption lines</a> associated with <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> and <a href="iron">iron</a> determined a <a href="redshift">redshift</a> of "z" = 0.8349 ± 0.0002, indicating that light from the burst had been absorbed by matter roughly 6 billion <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth. Although the redshift of the burst itself had not been determined, the absorbent matter was necessarily located between the burst and the Earth, implying that the burst itself was at least as far away. The absence of <a href="Lyman-alpha%20forest">Lyman-alpha forest</a> features in the spectra constrained the redshift to "z" ≤ 2.3, while further investigation by <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Reichart">Daniel E. Reichart</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> suggested a redshift of "z" ≈ 1.09. This was the first instance in which scientists were able to measure the redshift of a GRB. Several optical spectra were also obtained at the <a href="Calar%20Alto%20Observatory">Calar Alto Observatory</a> at wavelength ranges of and , but no emission lines were identified.

On May 13, five days after the first detection of GRB 970508, Frail resumed his observations with the Very Large Array. He made observations of the burst's position at a wavelength of 3.5 cm and immediately detected a strong signal. After 24 hours, the 3.5 cm signal became significantly stronger, and he also detected signals at the 6 and 21 cm wavelengths. This was the first confirmed observation of a radio afterglow of a GRB.

Over the next month, Frail observed that the luminosity of the radio source fluctuated significantly from day to day but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which <a href="Jeremy%20Goodman">Jeremy Goodman</a> of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> in the Milky Way. Such <a href="radio%20scintillation">radio scintillation</a>s (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3 microarcseconds.

BeppoSAX's Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, operating in the energy range of 40–700 <a href="Electron%20volt">keV</a>, recorded a <a href="fluence">fluence</a> of (1.85 ± 0.3) × 10 <a href="erg">erg</a>/cm (1.85 ± 0.3 <a href="nanojoule">nJ</a>/m), and the Wide Field Camera (2–26 keV) recorded a fluence of (0.7 ± 0.1) × 10 erg/cm (0.7 ± 0.1 nJ/m). BATSE (20–1000 keV) recorded a fluence of (3.1 ± 0.2) × 10 erg/cm (3.1 ± 0.2 nJ/m).

About 5 hours after the burst the <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of the object—a logarithmic measure of its brightness with a higher number indicating a fainter object—was 20.3 ± 0.3 in the <a href="Photometric%20system">U-band</a> (the ultraviolet region of the spectrum) and 21.2 ± 0.1 in the R-band (the red region of the spectrum). The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2 days after the burst was first detected—19.6 ± 0.3 in the U-band at 02:13 UTC on May 11, and 19.8 ± 0.2 in the R-band at 20:55 UTC on May 10.

James E. Rhoads, an astronomer at the <a href="Kitt%20Peak%20National%20Observatory">Kitt Peak National Observatory</a>, analyzed the burst and determined that it was not strongly <a href="Light%20beam">beamed</a>. Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5×10 ergs (5×10 J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3×10 erg (3×10 J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.

Prior to this burst, astronomers had not reached consensus regarding how far away GRBs occur from Earth. Although the <a href="Isotropy">isotropic distribution</a> of bursts suggested that they do not occur within the disk of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's <a href="Galactic%20spheroid">halo</a>, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at <a href="Physical%20cosmology">cosmological</a> distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.

Throughout the month of May the radio scintillations became less noticeable until they ceased altogether. This implies that the radio source significantly expanded in the time that had passed since the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a <a href="Theory%20of%20relativity">relativistically</a> expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.

The afterglow of GRB 970508 reached a peak total luminosity 19.82 days after the burst was detected. It then faded with a <a href="power%20law">power law</a> slope over about 100 days. The afterglow eventually disappeared, revealing the burst's host, an actively star-forming dwarf galaxy with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of "V" = 25.4 ± 0.15. The galaxy was well fitted by an <a href="exponential%20disk">exponential disk</a> with an <a href="ellipticity">ellipticity</a> of 0.70 ± 0.07. The redshift of GRB 970508's optical afterglow, "z" = 0.835, agreed with the host galaxy's redshift of "z" = 0.83, suggesting that, unlike previously observed bursts, GRB 970508 may have been associated with an <a href="active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galactic nucleus</a>.

Faryl

Faryl is the debut album by British <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> <a href="Faryl%20Smith">Faryl Smith</a>, released on 9 March 2009 by <a href="Universal%20Classics%20and%20Jazz">Universal Classics and Jazz</a>. Smith rose to fame after her appearance on the <a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%202%29">second series</a> of "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>", and signed with Universal after the competition. The album was recorded during December 2008 and January 2009 and features the track "River of Light", a song set to "<a href="The%20Blue%20Danube">The Blue Danube</a>" with newly written lyrics. "Faryl" was produced by Jon Cohen, and the backing music was provided by a 60-piece orchestra. As part of the album's promotion, Smith made numerous television and radio appearances and filmed a music video for "River of Light". Around this time, she met with <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">then-Prime Minister</a> <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>.

After its release, "Faryl" became the fastest-selling classical solo album in British chart history, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days, and a total of 29,200 copies in the first week, higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. "Faryl" entered the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> at number 6, rising to number 4 the next week, and was the third album by a "Britain's Got Talent" contestant to reach the top ten in Britain. Smith subsequently embarked on a promotional tour in the US to publicise the album, where it reached number 6 on the classical chart.

"Faryl" was fairly well received by critics, who praised Smith's performances and Cohen's production. However, criticism was directed at the use of the orchestra and at the song choices. As one of the ten best-selling classical albums in the UK in 2009, "Faryl" was nominated for a <a href="Classical%20BRIT%20Award">Classical BRIT Award</a> in the album of the year category, but lost to <a href="Only%20Men%20Aloud">Only Men Aloud</a>'s "<a href="Band%20of%20Brothers%20%28Only%20Men%20Aloud%21%20album%29">Band of Brothers</a>". In 2013, the album was <a href="Record%20certification">certified</a> gold by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a>.

Smith rose to fame when she, aged 12, competed in the <a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%202%29">second series</a> of <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> talent show "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>". During the series, she performed "<a href="Ave%20Maria%20%28Bach/Gounod%29">Ave Maria</a>" and a cover of <a href="Sarah%20McLachlan">Sarah McLachlan</a>'s "<a href="Angel%20%28Sarah%20McLachlan%20song%29">Angel</a>". After her initial performance, she received singing lessons from <a href="Yvie%20Burnett">Yvie Burnett</a>, a move criticised by the press. Although she was at one point the favourite to win, she finished outside the top three in the live final. During the competition, Smith rejected offers of a record deal, and afterwards rejected offers from <a href="Sony%20BMG">Sony BMG</a>, instead signing a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with <a href="Universal%20Classics%20and%20Jazz">Universal Classics and Jazz</a>, the most lucrative ever offered to a schoolgirl.

"Faryl" was recorded in London during Smith's <a href="school%20holiday">Christmas holiday</a> during December 2008 and January 2009, and completed on 3 January. It features a 60-piece orchestra, which was recorded at <a href="Air%20Studios">Air Studios</a>, in London. The album includes the song "River of Light". The track is a recording of "<a href="The%20Blue%20Danube">The Blue Danube</a>", a waltz composed by <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20II">Johann Strauss II</a>, with newly written lyrics. Smith talked about "River of Light" to the press, saying that "The Blue Danube" "now has words put to it. I like it because it's different. Everyone knows the tune and everybody has got high hopes for it." Smith said that her favourite song on the album was her version of the Welsh hymn "<a href="Calon%20L%C3%A2n">Calon Lân</a>". Other songs include Smith's version of "<a href="Amazing%20Grace">Amazing Grace</a>", a cover of "<a href="Annie%27s%20Song">Annie's Song</a>" by <a href="John%20Denver">John Denver</a>, and a version of "<a href="The%20Way%20Old%20Friends%20Do">The Way Old Friends Do</a>", rewritten for Smith by <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Ulvaeus">Björn Ulvaeus</a>. Smith spoke about the song, saying "It was about divorce ... They didn't think it was appropriate for me to sing about that, so Björn changed the lyrics so it's about friendship." The album was produced by Jon Cohen, who has previously worked with artists including the <a href="Operababes">Operababes</a> and <a href="Vanessa%20Mae">Vanessa Mae</a>.

On 23 February, "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" reported that Universal had received the first shipment of "Faryl", but due to a <a href="record%20press">pressing</a> error, though they looked like Smith's albums, they actually contained the music of <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">The Fall</a>'s album "<a href="Imperial%20Wax%20Solvent">Imperial Wax Solvent</a>". Universal was reported to have "severe words" with the pressing plant. The mix-up received attention from the international press, including an article in Canadian magazine "<a href="Exclaim%21">Exclaim!</a>".

Promotion began in January, with performances by Smith at the <a href="Mandarin%20Oriental%20Hotel%23The%20Mandarin%20Oriental%2C%20Hyde%20Park">Mandarin Oriental Hotel</a> and appearances at the debut of the <a href="Oliver%21%232009%20revival">"Oliver!" 2009 revival</a>. Smith also took part in a photoshoot for publicity and cover photos. According to writers for the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", the cover photo was modified to give Smith "a smile worthy of a model from a <a href="Colgate%20%28toothpaste%29">Colgate</a> advert", due to her "gappy teeth". Though generally critical of the move, the report conceded that it was better for Smith's teeth to be digitally straightened, rather than forcing her "to endure a battery of dental surgery". A television advert and music video for "River of Light" were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith also appeared on the cover of April's "<a href="Classic%20FM%20Magazine">Classic FM Magazine</a>". Further promotion in the weeks leading up to the release of "Faryl" included Smith appearing on "<a href="Loose%20Women">Loose Women</a>", "<a href="The%20Paul%20O%27Grady%20Show">The Paul O'Grady Show</a>", <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>, <a href="Radio%20Five%20Live">Radio Five Live</a> and "<a href="BBC%20Breakfast">BBC Breakfast</a>". She also appeared at the <a href="Children%27s%20Champion%20Awards">Children's Champion Awards</a> and met then-<a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>. On the day of the release, there was an album signing in Smith's hometown of <a href="Kettering">Kettering</a>, at the <a href="HMV">HMV</a> branch. Smith said "I definitely want to be at home for the launch. I want to be surrounded by my friends and family because, obviously, it's a big deal for me."

After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, spoke of plans to publicise "Faryl" in the US, saying "America is going to be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of "Faryl" in the US. She appeared on "<a href="The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>" in early May as part of her promotional tour. "Faryl" was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well as it did in the UK. She said that "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." After the release, she was more optimistic, saying "[w]hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on <a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%203%29">the third series of "Britain's Got Talent"</a>, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote "Faryl". She said that "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for "<a href="Wonderland%20%28Faryl%20Smith%20album%29">Wonderland</a>", her second album, which was released in November.

Reviewers were generally impressed by Smith's performances. Pete Paphides, writing for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", said that the songs were performed "with power and restraint", while Johnny Davis, writing for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", said "[y]ou can practically hear Katherine Jenkins weep as Faryl flawlessly executes Amazing Grace". Jason Birchmeier, writing for <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>, considered Smith's performance even more noteworthy because of her young age. However, though he considered Smith's voice impressive, Malcolm Mackenzie, writing for "<a href="The%20London%20Paper">The London Paper</a>", asked "will we care when the kid from Kettering loses her precocious appeal?" Reviewers also responded positively to Cohen's contribution to the album. Paphides claimed that his arrangements "suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist", while Birchmeier claimed that the album was "produced with fine precision".

Reviewers were more critical of the use of the orchestra. Helen Sloan, writing for "Crackerjack" ("<a href="Bristol%20Evening%20Post">Bristol Evening Post</a>") found that the orchestra rendered "the whole thing a bit bland and <a href="movie-soundtrack">movie-soundtrack</a>", and Birchmeier found it to be "a bit overwhelming" by the end of the album. Further, he was critical of the inclusion of "Amazing Grace" and "Ave Maria", considering them to be overly predictable song choices. Though he was pleasantly surprised by some of the inclusions (such as "River of Light" and "The Way Old Friends Do"), he concluded that "[i]t's too bad that [Smith] isn't given more creative material to sing. One hopes her next album is more adventurous."

Overall, Paphides awarded the album 3 out of a possible 5 stars, and compared it favourably to three other <a href="Mothering%20Sunday">Mothering Sunday</a> releases, <a href="Lionel%20Richie">Lionel Richie</a>'s "<a href="Just%20Go%20%28Lionel%20Richie%20album%29">Just Go</a>", <a href="Ronan%20Keating">Ronan Keating</a>'s "<a href="Songs%20for%20My%20Mother">Songs for My Mother</a>" and <a href="Barry%20Manilow">Barry Manilow</a>'s "<a href="The%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20the%20Eighties">The Greatest Songs of the Eighties</a>", considering it stronger than any of the others. Davis also awarded the album 3 out of 5, while Birchmeier was slightly more positive, awarding "Faryl" 3.5 out of 5.

At the beginning of February, "Faryl" was placed at 295 in <a href="Amazon.co.uk">Amazon.co.uk</a>'s best-sellers chart and 13 in its easy listening chart, based on pre-orders alone. A week before its release, the album was in the top 100 selling albums, and was the top-selling opera album. Retailers in the UK ordered more than 80,000 copies of the album in the week leading up to release, which Simon Cable, writing for the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", noted was more than <a href="U2">U2</a>'s recent "<a href="No%20Line%20on%20the%20Horizon">No Line on the Horizon</a>". It also topped the Amazon.co.uk presale chart. On the day of the release, based only on presales, the album was at the number 1 spot on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. The album became the fastest-selling classical solo album in Britain, beating <a href="Hayley%20Westenra">Hayley Westenra</a>'s "<a href="Pure%20%28Hayley%20Westenra%20album%29">Pure</a>", selling 20,000 copies in the first four days. The first week resulted in sales of 29,200 copies, which is higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. "Faryl" officially entered the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> at number 6, and climbed to number 4 the following week. "Faryl" made Smith the third former "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>" contestant to achieve a top ten album, after <a href="Paul%20Potts">Paul Potts</a> (with "<a href="One%20Chance%20%28album%29">One Chance</a>") and <a href="Andrew%20Johnston%20%28singer%29">Andrew Johnston</a> (with "<a href="One%20Voice%20%28Andrew%20Johnston%20album%29">One Voice</a>"). In the US, "Faryl" peaked at 31 on <a href="Top%20Heatseekers">Top Heatseekers</a> Albums chart, and at 6 on the Classical Albums chart, remaining in the charts for one and 17 weeks respectively. By February 2010, over 160,000 copies of "Faryl" had been sold, with over 150,000 of these in the UK. In July 2013, the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> <a href="Record%20certification">certified</a> the album gold, denoting shipments of over 100,000 units in the United Kingdom.

In February 2010, after the release of "Wonderland", "Faryl" was nominated for a <a href="Classic%20Brit%20Awards">Classical BRIT Award</a> in the album category. The category is voted for by the public, and the shortlist comprises the ten best-selling classical albums of the previous year. "Faryl" lost to <a href="Only%20Men%20Aloud">Only Men Aloud</a>'s "<a href="Band%20of%20Brothers%20%28Only%20Men%20Aloud%21%20album%29">Band of Brothers</a>".

Henry Wells (general)

<a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir Henry Wells, (22 March 1898 – 20 October 1973) was a senior officer in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>. Serving as <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> from 1954 to 1958, Wells' career culminated with his appointment as the first <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee</a>, a position marking him as the professional head of the Australian Military. He served in this capacity from March 1958 until March 1959, when he retired from the army.

Born in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, Wells began his career in the Australian Army in 1916 when he entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>. Graduating as a lieutenant three years later, he served in a variety of staff and instructional positions before the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Initially posted to the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a> as a staff officer in 1940, Wells was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made senior liaison officer to <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>. Serving in <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a>, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for his leadership at <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a>. Transferred to the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific theatre</a> in 1943 as a brigadier, he served in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20Campaign">New Guinea Campaign</a> with the headquarters of <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a> and later in the <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">Borneo campaign</a> with I Corps.

Wells was promoted to major general in 1946 and appointed <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a>. Following promotion to lieutenant general, he was made Commander-in-Chief, <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Forces%20Korea">British Commonwealth Forces Korea</a> from 1953 to 1954, serving during the last days of the war. In retirement, Wells was a director of several companies. Aged 75, he died in 1973.

Wells was born in the <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> town of <a href="Kyneton%2C%20Victoria">Kyneton</a> on 22 March 1898, the youngest of seven children to Arthur Wells, a <a href="draper">draper</a>, and his wife Elizabeth (née Carter). Educated at <a href="Kyneton%20Secondary%20College">Kyneton High School</a>, Wells entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in February 1916, where he was a keen sportsman. Graduating from the college in December 1919, he was <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> as a <a href="First%20lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the Australian Army, and posted to England for further training.

On his return to Australia, Wells was appointed as <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> and <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a> of the 8th Light Horse Regiment in 1921. The following year, he was allocated to the 9th Light Horse Regiment. In February 1926, Wells was briefly appointed <a href="brigade%20major">brigade major</a> of the 6th Cavalry Brigade, before becoming an instructor at the Small Arms School, Sydney, during July. On 14 December that year, Wells married Lorna Irene Skippen in a ceremony at St John's Church of England, <a href="Cessnock%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cessnock</a>; the couple would later have two sons.

During 1927, Wells was assigned to the Royal Military College, Duntroon as a company commander and promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a> that December. Returning to the Small Arms School as an instructor in 1931, he was dispatched to England and attended the <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a> between 1935 and 1936. Arriving back in Australia, Wells was made adjutant and quartermaster of the 4th/3rd Battalion, and later brigade major of the <a href="1st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">1st Infantry Brigade</a>. During 1938, he was reposted to Royal Military College, Duntroon as a lecturer on <a href="Military%20tactics">tactics</a>.

On 15 May 1940, Wells transferred to the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> for active service during the Second World War. Promoted to <a href="major">major</a>, he was posted to the headquarters of the 7th Division. Wells proceeded with the division to the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, where, on arriving in December, he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> and posted as senior liaison officer to I Corps. During this time, the Australian <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> and I Corps Headquarters were diverted for service in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Greek Campaign</a>.

Wells arrived in Greece on 7 March 1941, with an advance party of Lieutenant General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey's</a> I Corps staff. On 10 April, a plan was formulated to withdraw Greek and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> troops from their positions in the <a href="Verria">Verria</a> pass of the <a href="Vermion%20Mountains">Vermion Mountains</a> to the River <a href="Aliakmon">Aliakmon</a>. To carry this out, Blamey despatched Wells to coordinate the movement of the 12th Greek Division west to its new position. The withdrawal began on 12 April, but the force's movement was hampered because of lack of vehicles and the division did not arrive until late evening the following day. During this time, Wells travelled between I Corps Headquarters and the 12th Greek Division, organising and coordinating the division's movement, despite frequent air attacks on the roads.

On 24 April 1941, Wells embarked from Greece along with the remainder of the I Corps Headquarters during the British and Commonwealth withdrawal. Commended for his "conspicuous skill, ability and energy" and fostering "mutual confidence and goodwill between the Allied forces", Wells was recommended for the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, but was subsequently appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> for his services in Greece. The announcement of the award was published in a supplement to the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 30 December 1941. Then Brigadier <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a> later wrote of Wells during the campaign: "Tireless in his long journeys, helpful in every possible way, and courageous in all circumstances". For his "gallant and distinguished services" during this time, Wells was additionally <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">Mentioned in Despatches</a>.

Following Greece, the headquarters of I Corps returned to <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a>. Wells was made <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">General Staff Officer</a>, 2nd Grade (GSO2), the deputy chief of staff in charge of planning operations. I Corps was alerted to take part in the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria-Lebanon Campaign</a>, in spite of the fact that since Blamey had been promoted to Deputy Commander in Chief <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a>, the corps lacked a commanding officer. General <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wilson">Sir Henry Maitland Wilson</a>—the British commander in Palestine and <a href="Emirate%20of%20Transjordan">Transjordan</a>—believed that I Corps' loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in the campaign from the outset. Instead, Wilson attempted to exercise command from the <a href="King%20David%20Hotel">King David Hotel</a>. This proved to be a serious error, as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues, and were too remote from the battlefields to exercise the close command required. Following a series of reverses, I Corps headquarters was sent for on 18 June, and Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Lavarack">John Lavarack</a> assumed command that day. The headquarters was confronted by a difficult situation, with almost all reserves committed. Lavarack began regrouping his force, concentrating the 7th Division for a decisive thrust towards <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>. Hard fighting was required before the campaign was brought to a successful conclusion.

Promoted to <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, Wells became General Staff Officer, 1st Grade (GSO1), to the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Division</a> in November 1941. As such, he was the 9th Division's chief of staff, responsible for the full range of staff activities. On 28 June 1942, Wells accompanied Lieutenant General <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Sir Leslie Morshead</a>—Commander of the 9th Division—to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, where they received orders tasking the 9th Division with the defence of Cairo. The pair spent that night and the following day organising plans for the move, before Morshead received further orders on 30 June cancelling his previous instructions and directing the division instead be dispatched to <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Egypt">Alexandria</a>; the move took place on 1 July. Two days later, it was decided that the 24th Infantry Brigade would be sent forward to reinforce the position at <a href="El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a>. The brigade was lacking in equipment, and Wells spent that day arranging equipment for the unit as well as overseeing its preparation; the brigade moved forward the next day. The divisional headquarters proceeded to El Alamein on 7 July, and was posted to the northern flank of the British front line. The unit then spent the remainder of the month <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">in action</a> against <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> forces in the area. For his "distinguished services" during this period, Wells was Mentioned in Despatches a second time.

On 23 October 1942, the British and Commonwealth forces under Lieutenant General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">Bernard Montgomery</a> launched an <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">offensive against Axis forces</a> at El Alamein. The 9th Division took part in the battle, and was initially tasked with the seizure of a section of the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein%23Allied%20plan">Oxalic Line</a>. Over the proceeding twelve days, the Australians heavily contributed to the assault, with Morshead and his staff coordinating the 9th Division's operations; success was claimed on 4 November. Praised for his "ability of high order", Wells was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his efforts in training and preparing the division before the battle, in addition to his labours during the engagement. The notification for the decoration was published in a supplement to the "London Gazette" on 11 February 1943.

In late November 1942, the members of the 9th Division returned to Palestine. In January, the unit embarked from North Africa and sailed home to Australia in preparation for service against the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>.

Wells arrived back in Australia during February 1943. On 15 March, Morshead was appointed to command II Corps, and Wells was transferred along with him to the unit's headquarters as Brigadier, General Staff. He was promoted to temporary <a href="brigadier">brigadier</a> in April. During this time, the combat forces of the corps undertook training in both jungle and amphibious warfare in preparation for its planned deployment to <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Wells took an active hand in organising these exercises, before he moved with the corps headquarters to New Guinea during October.

The movement of II Corps coincided with the vicious fighting around the <a href="Huon%20Peninsula%20campaign">Huon Peninsula</a> and <a href="Finisterre%20Range%20campaign">Finisterre Range</a>. Wells assisted in the planning and coordination of operations over the subsequent months, which culminated in the seizure of Madang during April 1944. Wells was awarded his third Mention in Despatches during this time for his "exceptional services in the field".

In April 1944, II Corps was redesignated as I Corps and returned to Australia, where it established itself on the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a> in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. The following month, Wells proceeded to <a href="Structure%20of%20the%20Australian%20Army%23Land%20Command">Land Command Headquarters</a> in Sydney, where he attended a conference on staff appointments. He returned to the corps eleven days later. During this period, Wells was once again active in organising the unit's training off the Queensland coast, before he was granted a period of leave during August; he returned to duty on 26 September. On 19 July 1945, Wells was upgraded to a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> for his "exceptional ability and outstanding devotion to duty" in conjunction with the "valuable assistance" given throughout the New Guinea campaign to the <a href="General%20Officer%20Commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a>.

During March 1945, Wells acted as one of the eight <a href="pallbearer">pallbearer</a>s for Major General <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Alan Vasey</a> at the latter's funeral. Vasey had been killed in a plane crash just off the coast of Cairns, while en route to assume command of the 6th Division in New Guinea. That same month, it was decided that I Corps would lead an assault against the island of <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. As a consequence, headquarters of I Corps moved to <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a>, where it opened on 24 April. The initial Borneo landings took place on 1 May, with the Australian force in action at <a href="Tarakan%20Island">Tarakan</a>. Over the proceeding engagements, Wells assisted in the organisation and implementation of the operations in Borneo. As the war drew to a close in September 1945, Wells returned to Australia and was posted to Army Headquarters in Melbourne.

In March 1946, Wells was briefly posted as director of military operations at Army Headquarters, before being promoted to temporary <a href="major%20general">major general</a> and appointed <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a>. The following year, he embarked for the United Kingdom where he attended the <a href="Imperial%20Defence%20College">Imperial Defence College</a> in <a href="London">London</a>. During this time, Wells attended an investiture ceremony at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, where he was presented with his Commander of the Order of the British Empire by <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George VI</a>. On his return to Australia in 1949, Wells was made Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. He served in this position until February 1951, when he was appointed General Officer Commanding Southern Command with the rank of temporary lieutenant general. In June of that year, Wells acted as one of the ten pallbearers to Field Marshal <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a> at his <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> in Melbourne.

Wells was appointed Commander-in-Chief, <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Forces%20Korea">British Commonwealth Forces Korea</a>, in 1953. Assuming the role on 11 February, he led the Commonwealth contingent for the next twenty-one months as the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> was coming to an end. Like his predecessors in the position, Wells exercised administrative command only, and had no direct control over battlefield operations. Though its incumbents were considered to have performed well, the role garnered little credit for helping facilitate combat success but was a soft target for criticism when operations did not run smoothly. Wells had been sent to Korea with no instructions regarding the withdrawal of troops and—as armistice talks appeared on the verge of success—he was closely involved in liaison with the heads of Commonwealth governments regarding General <a href="Mark%20Wayne%20Clark">Mark Clark's</a> requests for their commitment to retain forces in the theatre for some period following the end of hostilities.

Raised to substantive lieutenant general on 12 April 1954, Wells was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> that June. He was commended for his "exceptional meritorious service" in Korea, and awarded the United States' <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> in the degree of Commander. Presented with the decoration by General <a href="John%20E.%20Hull">John E. Hull</a> on 19 October, Wells returned to Australia three days later. In December, he was made Chief of the General Staff; the professional head of the Australian Army. Wells' appointment coincided with the commitment of Australian forces to the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, and as such he presided over the deployment of soldiers to the engagement as well as the formation of the first regular brigade group. He was upgraded to a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1956 New Years Honours.

On 23 March 1958, Wells was appointed the first Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC); the professional head of the Australian Military. The position had previously existed as an extension to the responsibilities of the senior service chief—either the <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of Naval Staff</a>, Chief of the General Staff or <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>—but Wells was the first to occupy the position as a separate post. The chairmanship of COSC was created as part of the <a href="Australian%20government">Australian government</a>'s response to a review of the Defence group of departments conducted by Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead in 1957, which recommended greater centralisation of the armed forces. Although the Chairman was the Government's principal military advisor and reported directly to the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>, Wells was not promoted and remained at the same rank as the heads of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Navy</a>, Army and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>. He was also hampered by being given only a small staff. The role of the Chairman, COSC was not strengthened until 1965, when Air Marshal <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Sir Frederick Scherger</a>—who had been appointed to the position in 1961—was promoted to <a href="Air%20Chief%20Marshal%20%28Australia%29">air chief marshal</a> so that he out-ranked the service heads. Wells served in this capacity until his retirement from the Australian military on 22 March 1959.

In retirement, Wells was appointed as a director to several companies, including Broken Hill South Ltd, Metal Manufactures Ltd, Navcot Australia Pty Ltd and Sitmar Line (Australia) Pty Ltd. During April 1961, Wells was appointed honorary colonel of the <a href="Royal%20Victoria%20Regiment">Royal Victoria Regiment</a>. Described as "somewhat reserved and taciturn" during his life, Wells died at <a href="Yarrawonga%2C%20Victoria">Yarrawonga, Victoria</a>, on 20 October 1973, and was survived by his wife and their two sons. His funeral service took place with full military honours at Toorak Presbyterian Church, after which he was cremated. In his will, Wells bequeathed a sizable proportion of his estate to <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Junior Legacy</a>, Melbourne. Wells Road, a street in <a href="Duntroon%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory</a>, is named in his honour.
