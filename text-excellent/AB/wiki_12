D'Oliveira affair

The D'Oliveira affair was a prolonged political and sporting controversy relating to the scheduled 1968–69 tour of South Africa by the <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England cricket team</a>, who were officially representing the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC). The point of contention was whether or not the England selectors would include <a href="Basil%20D%27Oliveira">Basil D'Oliveira</a>, a mixed-race South African player who had represented England in <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> since 1966, having moved there six years earlier. With South Africa under <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>, the potential inclusion by England of a non-white South African in their tour party became a political issue.

A <a href="Cape%20Coloureds">Cape Coloured</a> of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa primarily because the era's <a href="apartheid%20legislation">apartheid legislation</a> seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred him from the all-white Test team. He qualified for <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire County Cricket Club</a> through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister <a href="B.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJ.%20Vorster">B. J. Vorster</a> sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable.

D'Oliveira was omitted from the England team for part of 1968 amid a slump in his batting form, but he marked his return in late August with a score of 158 runs in England's final Test match of the year, against <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. Days later, the MCC selectors omitted D'Oliveira from the team to tour South Africa; they insisted that this was based entirely on cricketing merit, but many in Britain voiced apprehension and there was a public outcry. After <a href="Tom%20Cartwright">Tom Cartwright</a>'s withdrawal because of injury on 16 September, the MCC chose D'Oliveira as a replacement, prompting accusations from Vorster and other South African politicians that the selection was politically motivated. Attempts to find a compromise followed, but these led nowhere. The MCC announced the tour's cancellation on 24 September.

<a href="Sporting%20boycott%20of%20South%20Africa%20during%20the%20Apartheid%20era">Sporting boycotts</a> of South Africa were already under way by 1968, but the D'Oliveira controversy was the first to have a serious effect on South African cricket. The <a href="South%20African%20Cricket%20Board%20of%20Control">South African Cricket Board of Control</a> announced its intention to remove racial barriers in South African cricket in 1969, and formally integrated the sport in 1976. Meanwhile, the boycott movement escalated sharply, leading to South Africa's near-complete isolation from international cricket from 1971, though the country continued to play international rugby into the 1980s, twice allowing mixed-race <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand rugby teams</a> into the country during the 1970s. D'Oliveira played for England until 1972, and for Worcestershire until 1979. South Africa returned to international cricket in 1991, soon after apartheid began to be dismantled.

From the time that European settlers first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided. Following its general election victory <a href="South%20African%20general%20election%2C%201948">in 1948</a>, the <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">National Party</a>, led by <a href="Daniel%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Malan">Daniel Malan</a>, formalised this racism under a government policy called <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>. Under apartheid, different races were kept apart in all aspects of life. This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and <a href="apartheid%20legislation">laws</a>, supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.

From a cricketing viewpoint, the apartheid policy made little difference. Although cricket was played widely among the different racial groups in South Africa, the <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">Test team</a>, which represented the country in international matches, had always been all white. Under apartheid, this became official policy under the government reasoning that black, <a href="coloured">coloured</a> (mixed race) and <a href="Indian%20South%20Africans">Indian</a> players were inherently inferior and not worthy of selection. Different races were forbidden from competing against each other. South African cricket teams did not compete against <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a>, <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> or the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>, but teams from <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>, <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a> continued to visit the country. English cricketers particularly enjoyed tours to South Africa owing to the hospitality they received and the quality of living. The political writer and historian <a href="Peter%20Oborne">Peter Oborne</a> commented: "Relations between the cricket establishments of the two countries were exceptionally warm. Only few visitors noticed, and even fewer cared, that there was something wrong."

During the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20South%20Africa%20in%201948%E2%80%9349">tour of South Africa during 1948–49</a>, the first under apartheid, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> commentator <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> was horrified when he saw a black man assaulted for no reason. This prompted him to visit several <a href="Township%20%28South%20Africa%29">townships</a> where he found black people living in very poor conditions. He contrasted this unfavourably with the luxury of the homes where he was entertained by white families. <a href="Billy%20Griffith">Billy Griffith</a>, one of the touring team, accompanied him on one visit to a township, and was similarly appalled, but did not speak out against it. Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast, and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example was followed by the England batsman and clergyman <a href="David%20Sheppard">David Sheppard</a>, who declined to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of the South African government despite efforts by the MCC to silence him. Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.

From the mid-1950s, the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> began to express concern over apartheid, and there was a growing general awareness in Britain of its effects. In 1960 the <a href="UK%20Prime%20Minister">UK Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>, criticised apartheid in his "<a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">Wind of Change</a>" speech to the South African parliament. However, the British government was cautious; the large number of British passport holders and businesses based in South Africa made them reluctant to force the issue and provoke a confrontation. Additionally, there was support for the policy among some right-wing politicians. When the MCC team <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20South%20Africa%20in%201956%E2%80%9357">toured South Africa in 1956–57</a>, the players observed and were shocked by what they considered to be injustices against the black population. As many players and officials had family and friends in the country, they were disinclined to take a stand, but several condemned the situation in print at the time or later.

Overall attitudes in Britain towards South African cricket began to change in the 1960s. At the time, race was becoming a more emotive matter in Britain and <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20since%20Irish%20independence">immigration from Asia and the Caribbean</a> became an issue in general elections. Racial tensions had risen throughout the 1950s, and race riots had occurred. Tim Quelch, in his review of English cricket in the 1950s, suggests that "[England's] record on race relations had hardly been exemplary". But Jack Williams, in his book "Cricket and Race", suggests that cricket was a force for racial harmony in England given the influx of African-Caribbean and Asian overseas players and the mingling of white and African-Caribbean supporters during several Test series between England and the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>. Against this background, when <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201960">the South African team toured England in 1960</a>, there were some protests against apartheid.

Within South Africa, there was growing realisation among opponents of apartheid that sport could play a role in pressuring the government. During the 1950s, South Africa competed freely in international competition; the governing bodies of the major international sports recognised only the official, all-white South African institutions. By the end of the decade, this began to change. Several non-white sporting organisations within South Africa united and began to influence international opinion. The resulting pressure brought about the suspension of the all-white <a href="South%20African%20Football%20Association">Football Association of South Africa</a> from <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>—for two years from 1961, then after a brief reinstatement, again from 1964—which prevented <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20football%20team">South Africa</a> from participating in the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a>. South Africa was also excluded from international fencing in 1964. However, because neither fencing nor football was closely followed in white South Africa, the impact was limited. <a href="Apartheid-era%20South%20Africa%20and%20the%20Olympics">Suspension from the Olympics</a> had a greater effect; another campaign from within South Africa and the consequent change in international opinion resulted in South Africa being barred from the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Olympics</a> and those that followed.

In 1966, before a tour by the <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand rugby team</a>, the South African government asked New Zealand to field an all-white team (thereby excluding <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> players); the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20Union">New Zealand Rugby Football Union</a> refused and cancelled the tour. As rugby was very popular among white South Africans, this caused concern in that community. The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, by then the secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances. Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket. Efforts to put pressure on the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Conference</a> (ICC) failed, and even when South Africa withdrew from the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.

<a href="Basil%20D%27Oliveira">Basil D'Oliveira</a> was born in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> in 1931 and, coming from a mixed Indian-Portuguese background, formed part of the <a href="Cape%20Coloureds">Cape Coloured</a> community. He demonstrated skill in cricket from an early age, but as the apartheid system classified him as non-white, he was barred from playing <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> in South Africa or representing the national team. He represented and captained a "non-white" South African team which played unofficial international matches. He was left distraught by the cancellation in 1959, at the behest of South African anti-apartheid campaigners, of a proposed visit by a West Indies team which was to compete against non-white sides. Realising that he had achieved all he could as a non-white sportsman in South Africa, he wrote to John Arlott in England to ask for help finding employment as a cricketer.

Arlott enlisted the help of <a href="John%20Kay%20%28cricket%20journalist%29">John Kay</a>, a cricket journalist with expertise in the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29">Lancashire leagues</a>, to find a job for D'Oliveira as a club professional. No teams were initially interested, but when <a href="Middleton%20Cricket%20Club">Middleton</a>'s professional withdrew at the last minute, the club employed D'Oliveira for the 1960 season. After a poor start, he prospered for Middleton. He established a wider reputation by playing televised matches for a team called the "Cavaliers", and took part in overseas tours with some leading cricketers. Several English <a href="county%20cricket%20club">county cricket club</a>s expressed an interest in him, and he eventually joined <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. Qualifying for the county team through residency, he made his debut in 1964 and scored a <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> on his first appearance. By the 1966 season, he had progressed to the point that he was picked for England Test team. D'Oliveira was immediately successful for England; by the following year he was well-established in the team.

From early in his England career, D'Oliveira and his supporters saw the MCC tour of South Africa in 1968–69 as potentially being a key moment in his career. Guy Fraser-Sampson suggests: "Nobody could be in any doubt that the possibility of D'Oliveira being chosen as a member of the England touring party would raise massive political complications". When D'Oliveira visited South Africa to work as a coach in 1966, the subject was raised continually. People speculated whether D'Oliveira would be selected and, if so, whether the South African government would allow him to play. Some of his supporters worried that his acceptance of a place on a tour to South Africa might be interpreted as approval of the political situation there, but D'Oliveira was determined to play, aware of what it would mean to the non-white people of South Africa. In 1967, Griffith flew to South Africa to discuss the forthcoming tour and to seek a solution to any potential problems—the MCC wanted the tour to go ahead without any political trouble. Little came of the meetings; Oborne suggests that both sides simply "agreed to hope that the whole issue went away".

After a successful season for England in 1967, D'Oliveira was chosen to tour the West Indies in 1967–68; this raised awareness in England and South Africa that he was a realistic contender to tour South Africa a year later. However, his opportunities to excel were few in the West Indies; circumstances were against him in several matches, and he had a statistically poor tour. Any mitigating circumstances were offset by problems off the field. D'Oliveira took full advantage of the social opportunities available on a tour of the West Indies and frequently disappeared to parties and other events, often not reappearing until after breakfast. Rumours to this effect reached the press and the MCC tour manager spoke to D'Oliveira about his responsibilities on tour. D'Oliveira said that his behaviour and poor form were partly a result of the pressure placed on him. He was frequently questioned about the South African tour and about race—some groups in the West Indies accused him of "selling out" by playing for England's "white" team.

The position of the South African government towards mixed-race teams was well established by 1967. It was stated explicitly after the visit of Griffith when, in February 1967, the Interior Minister <a href="P.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BK.%20Le%20Roux">P. K. Le Roux</a> said in a speech: "We will not allow mixed teams to play against our white teams here. That is our policy. It is well known here and overseas." These comments caused a public row in Britain, and some commentators wanted the tour to be called off; the MCC informed the British government that players would be selected on ability alone and that any attempts from within South Africa to interfere would cause the tour to be cancelled. <a href="Denis%20Howell%2C%20Baron%20Howell">Denis Howell</a>, the <a href="Minister%20for%20Sport%20and%20the%20Olympics">Minister for Sport</a>, informed the House of Commons of the MCC position and stated that the government expected that the MCC would cancel the tour if any player were to be rejected. Privately, the MCC committee were unhappy to have been forced into so unequivocal a position.

<a href="B.%20J.%20Vorster">B. J. Vorster</a>, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20South%20Africa">Prime Minister of South Africa</a>, was embarrassed by Le Roux's public comments and forced him to deny having made them. However, the British government's intervention cemented in Vorster's mind the idea that it and the MCC were closely connected. In April 1967 he gave a speech in which he said that while sport between white and non-white teams could not take place in South Africa, the government would be prepared to send mixed teams to play abroad and to accommodate mixed teams from South Africa's "traditional" opponents. This change of direction was aimed at entering a team in the <a href="1968%20Summer%20Olympics">1968 Olympics</a>, to avoid a repeat of the cancelled New Zealand rugby tour and with D'Oliveira's selection in mind. The MCC decided later in 1967 to clarify that Vorster's government would impose no limitations on the players chosen for the tour. In January 1968, Griffith wrote on behalf of the MCC to the <a href="Cricket%20South%20Africa">South African Cricket Association</a> (SACA) with the implication that the tour would be cancelled if a free selection was not guaranteed.

According to Oborne, Vorster was a pragmatic politician who wanted to maintain apartheid and to make it appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not to go too far. Oborne writes: "Vorster knew that there was a limit to how far he could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira." According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, while at the same time doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government. Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.

In March 1968, having received no response from the SACA to Griffith's letter, the MCC asked <a href="Alec%20Douglas-Home">Alec Douglas-Home</a> to intervene. Douglas-Home, a former British Prime Minister and then the <a href="Shadow%20Foreign%20Secretary">Opposition spokesman for foreign affairs</a>, had just finished his term as MCC president and was visiting <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> and South Africa; he agreed to raise the question of D'Oliveira during a meeting with Vorster that was part of his itinerary. Douglas-Home believed that the best way to deal with apartheid was through dialogue and that contact between the countries should be increased, not reduced—as he described it, "precept and example must be better than ostracism". When he met Vorster, Douglas-Home was reluctant to press him for an unequivocal answer, but discussed D'Oliveira. He also sounded out other figures in South Africa and returned to England to tell the MCC, in the words of the cricket writer <a href="E.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BW.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a>, that "if D'Oliveira were to be chosen the odds were 5/4 on his being allowed in".

In the view of Fraser-Sampson: "While Douglas-Home's motives remain obscure, it is clear that he muddied the waters dreadfully. By allowing the MCC to believe they could continue happily fudging the issue, and by misleading them as to Vorster's true intentions, he delivered the worst of both worlds." Following Douglas-Home's advice, the MCC let the matter drift throughout the 1968 season. Conscious of D'Oliveira's poor form in the West Indies and continued lack of success during early 1968, the MCC committee kept in mind that it was far from certain that he would even make the team to tour South Africa.

Meanwhile, with the knowledge of Vorster and the South African government, the SACA carefully devised its answer to the MCC letter. The reply, which avoided directly answering the MCC question, was hand-delivered to the MCC secretary <a href="Gubby%20Allen">George "Gubby" Allen</a> in March 1968 by the former South African Test captain <a href="Jack%20Cheetham">Jack Cheetham</a>, a close associate of several MCC officials. By this point, the MCC had accepted Douglas-Home's advice and no longer wanted a reply to their letter—Oborne records that when Cheetham "cheerily produced his laboriously produced document, a panic-stricken Gubby Allen waved it away." The letter was never presented to the full MCC Committee, and Cheetham returned to South Africa with news that a reply was not required—preparations for the tour could proceed as normal. This allowed Vorster to conceal his intentions regarding D'Oliveira for a further six months. Allen later justified his actions by suggesting that he was concerned that the SACA letter would be leaked to the press if it went any further. Oborne believes that Allen wished to hide from the full committee the MCC hierarchy's change of mind over the approach to take with the South Africans; he suggests that Allen and Griffith were effectively acting as a secret MCC subcommittee from this point.

Vorster and the SACA followed D'Oliveira's form closely throughout the tour of West Indies and into the 1968 season. D'Oliveira's lack of success prompted press speculation that he might lose his England place for entirely non-political reasons, but Vorster was convinced that the MCC were committed to selecting him under any circumstances. He therefore conceived a two-pronged plan to prevent D'Oliveira's selection for the 1968–69 tour. He and the SACA would attempt to bribe D'Oliveira to make himself unavailable, while simultaneously persuading the English selectors—or more specifically the MCC, who Vorster believed would determine selection policy—not to choose him. The latter part of the plan depended on the MCC realising that picking D'Oliveira would mean no tour, but in making such attempts the South Africans risked public discovery, which would cause the tour to be cancelled anyway.

The bribery was planned from an early stage, but had to be postponed when D'Oliveira did not return to South Africa before the 1968 season. The second part of the plan was put into operation in March 1968. Vorster resolved to send a secret message to the MCC through <a href="Charles%20Lyttelton%2C%2010th%20Viscount%20Cobham">Lord Cobham</a>, a member and former president of the MCC with close links to D'Oliveira's county side Worcestershire. Cobham was visiting South Africa at Griffith's request to meet <a href="Arthur%20Coy">Arthur Coy</a>, an official of the SACA. Cobham told Coy that he wanted the tour to go ahead, but agreed with him that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be "disastrous". Cobham seems to have promised Coy that he would attempt to dissuade D'Oliveira from touring, but never actually did so. Cobham then met Vorster, who told him that if D'Oliveira were chosen, the tour would be cancelled.

On his return to England, Cobham kept this information from the full MCC committee, knowing that they would be forced to cancel the tour if they became aware of it. Instead, he wrote a letter to a committee member, whose identity has never been made public. The letter's recipient passed it on to Griffith, who in turn showed it to Allen and <a href="Arthur%20Gilligan">Arthur Gilligan</a>, at that time the MCC president. These three men chose to hide the information from the full committee, and nobody informed Denis Howell. Allen later defended these actions, setting out his reasoning in his biography, which was written by his close friend Swanton—Allen argued that the advice given by Douglas-Home, an international diplomat, took precedence over Cobham's information and had already been accepted by the MCC. He further suggested that, as the four England selectors had to choose the team "without any other consideration", and two of them sat on the MCC committee, it would have been unfair to burden them with Cobham's information. Oborne dismisses Allen's reasoning as "disastrously muddled", pointing out that Cobham's advice was far more up-to-date than Douglas-Home's, and that there would have been no burden of conscience for the team selectors as the new information would have caused the tour to be cancelled.

By the beginning of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.

D'Oliveira was aware of the political discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> and taking two wickets. After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage. Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.

Before the second Test, played at Lord's, a series of events took place that Fraser-Sampson later described as "so bizarre as to be totally unbelievable, and yet [they] happened". The evening before play began, Griffith suggested to D'Oliveira that, to save the 1968–69 series, he should withdraw himself from consideration for the tour, and announce that he wished in future to play for South Africa rather than England. D'Oliveira angrily declined. The next day, E. W. Swanton—a journalist technically unconnected with the MCC, but a close friend of Allen and a member of the "Establishment"—approached the player with a similar proposition, which D'Oliveira again dismissed. Both Griffith and Swanton were opposed to apartheid—Swanton had refused to report on the 1964–65 MCC tour of South Africa because of his objections to the system, and he supported D'Oliveira from a cricketing standpoint. This plan probably originated from one of the several South Africans present at Lord's with an interest in the D'Oliveira question, including Coy and the private cricket tour organiser Wilfred Isaacs; according to Fraser-Sampson, there is evidence to suggest that it first came from the SACA. Oborne writes that Griffith and Swanton were probably well-intentioned, and posits that they might have been caught up in a South African scheme in their search for a solution to the D'Oliveira problem. Fraser-Sampson suggests that they and other MCC figures may have felt forced into this course of action by the vigour of the South Africans' protests that they would not tolerate a team including D'Oliveira.

On the morning of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by <a href="Colin%20Cowdrey">Colin Cowdrey</a>, the England captain, that he had been left out of the team and was instead <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a>. In his place, England chose a fast bowler to strengthen their bowling attack. While the game was taking place, <a href="Doug%20Insole">Doug Insole</a>, the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended. Oborne suggests that, from a cricketing viewpoint, the decision to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it may have been connected to the South African presence at Lord's. The replacement for D'Oliveira, <a href="Barry%20Knight%20%28cricketer%29">Barry Knight</a>, performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81. He maintained his form as a bowler, but critics believed his chance had gone. In July, as part of a standard procedure, the MCC wrote to 30 leading players to ask if they were available to tour South Africa; D'Oliveira was not contacted. According to Fraser-Sampson, the idea that D'Oliveira was not then one of England's best 30 players was absurd; he writes that the selectors must therefore have been aware that Vorster would not accept his selection and they had consequently decided not to choose him.

During his slump in form, D'Oliveira was contacted by Tienie Oosthuizen, a director at the tobacco company <a href="Carreras%20Tobacco%20Company">Carreras</a>, which was, alongside <a href="Rothmans%20International">Rothmans</a>, part of the South African <a href="Rembrandt%20Group">Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation</a>. Rembrandt had set up a group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately at the end of the 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place. D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team, then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.

During a later press investigation, Oosthuizen claimed to have acted independently. <a href="Anton%20Rupert">Anton Rupert</a>, the head of Rembrandt, endorsed this version, asserting that Oosthuizen had acted in his capacity as an employee of the SASF. Rupert said this was an autonomous organisation, but according to Oborne the SASF constitution made it totally dependent on Rembrandt. Oborne writes that Oosthuizen's offers were rooted in the plans made by Vorster and Coy to bribe D'Oliveira indirectly by offering him work that would prevent him from playing for the MCC. Oborne surmises that the position and salary offered to D'Oliveira did not come from the SASF, but were actually part of a scheme involving Vorster and Rupert to remove the controversial player from the tour. Williams also concludes that the offer was effectively a bribe to stop D'Oliveira playing.

In early August, D'Oliveira returned to form with an innings of 89 against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>. Before the fifth and final England–Australia Test match, played between 22 and 27 August, Cowdrey batted at <a href="the%20Oval">the Oval</a>, where the match was to be played, and deduced that medium-paced bowlers would be very effective given the condition of the cricket pitch. Consequently, when the England team was chosen, he asked for a medium-paced bowler to be placed in reserve in case conditions warranted their selection. The two first-choice selections, Knight and <a href="Tom%20Cartwright">Tom Cartwright</a>, were unavailable, so D'Oliveira was called up by Cowdrey as a reserve on account of his bowling. On the day before the game, one of the England batsmen, <a href="Roger%20Prideaux">Roger Prideaux</a>, withdrew from the team, saying he had an infection. The team was duly re-arranged and the new version included D'Oliveira as a batsman. He heard no more from Oosthuizen, who was transferred from the London office soon after. The intervention of Oosthuizen became public knowledge when it was reported in the press in April 1969.

Feeling much more confident, D'Oliveira expected to be successful in the Oval Test match. Before the game, an unnamed MCC official circulated a story that D'Oliveira had been offered thousands of pounds to keep himself available for the South Africa tour. This was a similar story to that which D'Oliveira had told Oosthuizen; it had probably travelled back to the MCC via South Africa, but was not true. When the game began, Australia held a 1–0 lead after four Tests; England needed a win to level the series. England made a reasonable start on the first day, but a late wicket brought D'Oliveira in to bat with the game delicately poised. Oborne observes that D'Oliveira was under huge pressure, both for simple cricketing reasons and because the world was watching to see if he would be successful. "Wisden" reported: "In the last hour D'Oliveira began his fine effort. He hooked the short ball superbly". At the end of the first day, he had scored 23 runs.

Early on the second day, D'Oliveira batted with less certainty. He was dropped by the opposition wicket-keeper with his score on 31, but he was encouraged by the umpire <a href="Charlie%20Elliott">Charlie Elliott</a> and his batting partner <a href="John%20Edrich">John Edrich</a>. As his score reached fifty, Elliott whispered, "Well played—my God you're going to cause some problems." D'Oliveira went on to score 158 runs before he was out, although he was dropped a few more times after passing three figures. He received a prolonged ovation from the crowd when he was out, and congratulations from <a href="John%20Gleeson%20%28cricketer%29">John Gleeson</a>, one of the opposing Australians. Oborne assesses the innings as one of the best ever: despite the relatively weak attack and easy batting conditions, Oborne believes that no other cricketer had faced so much pressure and so many outside forces conspiring against him. Later in the game, D'Oliveira also contributed with the ball. After rain had reduced the amount of playing time and caused further delays through the subsequent clean-up, England faced a race against time to win the match. D'Oliveira took a crucial wicket with his 12th ball to break a long partnership and open the way for <a href="Derek%20Underwood">Derek Underwood</a> to bowl England to victory in the game and a share in the series.

Off the field, manoeuvres started immediately. Vorster followed the innings closely, with Oosthuizen in attendance. On the second day of the match, <a href="Geoffrey%20Howard%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Geoffrey Howard</a>, the secretary of <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey County Cricket Club</a> (who played at the Oval), received a call from Oosthuizen, who informed Howard that he had been trying without success to contact Billy Griffith. He told Howard to pass along to Griffith the message that if "today's centurion is picked, the tour will be off". Meanwhile, Insole asked D'Oliveira if he was available to tour South Africa, and Cowdrey questioned him about how he would handle the inevitably tense situations. Cowdrey also said that he wanted him in the team. D'Oliveira was left in little doubt that he would be selected to tour South Africa.

The selectors, after a six-hour meeting, chose the team to tour South Africa on 27 August 1968. The official records of the meeting are incomplete and of those present, no one left an account of what happened. Oborne believes that at least ten men were present—the four selectors, Insole, <a href="Peter%20May%20%28cricketer%29">Peter May</a>, <a href="Don%20Kenyon">Don Kenyon</a> and <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a>; the England captain Colin Cowdrey; Gubby Allen, Billy Griffith, Arthur Gilligan and <a href="Donald%20Carr">Donald Carr</a> for the MCC; and possibly <a href="Maurice%20Allom">Maurice Allom</a>, another MCC member. Oborne suggests that one of those present might have been acting for the South African government, as Vorster was well-informed about what happened at the meeting and followed events closely. He also observes that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what would happen if D'Oliveira were selected; he argues that they may have passed the information on to other selectors. Coy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may also have made the South African position clear at the meeting. According to Oborne, "Everyone in the room, with the possible exception of the Worcestershire skipper Don Kenyon, would have been aware that the selection of D'Oliveira could at best cause difficulties and at worst cause the tour to be cancelled." Fraser-Sampson goes further, suggesting that Insole, and possibly also May, knew the whole story from an early stage.

From a cricketing viewpoint, most critics agreed that D'Oliveira should probably have been selected based on his score at the Oval, his past record, and the usefulness of his bowling. The selectors left him out, however, deciding that his bowling was not strong enough to classify him as an all-rounder. Oborne points out that, judged in cricketing terms, this was "not an outrage". D'Oliveira had several rivals as a batsman, and of the places available, one went to <a href="Ken%20Barrington">Ken Barrington</a>, who had a good Test record, and the other to <a href="Keith%20Fletcher">Keith Fletcher</a>, who was much younger than D'Oliveira. Oborne judges both of these decisions fair. Nobody at the selection meeting supported including D'Oliveira. Some of those present said later that, despite his prior assurances to D'Oliveira, Cowdrey opposed his selection at the meeting, which influenced others there. Fraser-Sampson suggests that Cowdrey, who later tried to justify his role in events, may have inwardly supported D'Oliveira's inclusion, but spoken against it out of a lack of confidence and decisiveness. It is also possible, argues Fraser-Sampson, that if May had been aware of the true state of affairs, he may have confided in Cowdrey, a close friend; this would have left Cowdrey, who was very keen to lead a team to South Africa, in a difficult and conflicted position. Fraser-Sampson concludes: "Far from being the villain of the piece, Cowdrey may simply have been an honourable man pushed beyond the limits of his character and overwhelmed by events."

As is customary at such selection meetings, there was no vote. Insole recalled that there was no hostility towards D'Oliveira at the meeting, and pointed out that although he was not chosen in the main team, he was made a reserve. Williams, while acknowledging that there were several worthy batsmen as candidates for places in the team, asserts that even if those at the meeting had only discussed the players' respective cricketing abilities, "every selector must have known that by not selecting D'Oliveira they would improve the prospects of the tour going ahead." The full MCC Committee met to formally approve the selected team on the afternoon of 28 August. Nobody voiced opposition.

D'Oliveira, who learned of his omission over the radio in the Worcestershire dressing room having just scored 128 runs against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>, was deeply upset and faced intense press attention. Insole and Griffith defended the decision to omit D'Oliveira to the press, saying that there had been no pressure from South Africa and that the chosen team simply included better players than D'Oliveira. Oborne writes that Insole considered the events surrounding the selection meeting as among the worst of his life, but that "he and the other selectors were victims of the decision, reached on the advice of Alec Douglas-Home early in 1968, not to press for an answer to the MCC demand there should be 'no preconditions' for the tour. Once that decision had been made, everything else followed: the bribery attempt, the secret pressure and the nobbling of the MCC. Had the matter been dealt with ... Insole would never have been subject to the innuendo and accusations of racism and betrayal that have haunted him ever since."

While the general public were baffled that a man who just scored a century against Australia could be left out of the team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision. Some journalists supported the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>". Others, prominently the former England captain <a href="Ted%20Dexter">Ted Dexter</a>, the former Test player <a href="Trevor%20Bailey">Trevor Bailey</a> and E. W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira deserved to be in the team on merit. Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission. Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player <a href="Learie%20Constantine">Learie Constantine</a>, openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because of his race or because the MCC supported apartheid. Some <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> politicians also expressed concern. John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira deserved to be included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should perhaps have selected him even if this were not the case. The general press took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government. According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.

More recent commentators suggest that the MCC members were not directly motivated by support of apartheid. Oborne argues that the MCC establishment, without favouring apartheid, wished to maintain traditional links with white South Africa. Williams suggests that the committee were politically naive, and that they ignored the political dimensions of D'Oliveira's non-selection. Williams writes that the committee seemed unaware that its decision made it appear to support apartheid. Fraser-Sampson believes that those involved "acted for what they thought were the best of motives, namely what they saw as the good of the game." Regarding the right-wing links of some individuals—Gilligan had been a member of the <a href="British%20Fascists">British Fascists</a> during the 1920s, and Bedser later became a member of <a href="the%20Freedom%20Association">the Freedom Association</a>, which Fraser-Sampson classifies as "far-right"—neither Oborne nor Fraser-Sampson suggests that the two men were racist, or that any of the selectors' actions regarding D'Oliveira were tainted by prejudice or support for apartheid. Fraser-Sampson does comment, however, that some individuals were "apologists" for Vorster, and that many of them firmly believed in the separation of politics and sport.

Not all MCC members supported the selectors. Around 70 members met, including the clergyman and former England captain David Sheppard, and called for the tour to be abandoned. Sheppard's intervention shook Cowdrey, a religious man. Within weeks, several MCC members had resigned in protest at the decision, and the MCC had received nearly 1,000 letters about it, mainly complaints. In South Africa, whites received the news happily—one nationalist rally broke into cheers upon hearing the news—while the black community viewed the omission as a betrayal. The British <a href="Anti-Apartheid%20Movement">Anti-Apartheid Movement</a> sent telegrams to the Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, asking him to intervene, and to Gilligan, asking for the tour to be cancelled on the grounds that by playing in South Africa the England team would be "condoning apartheid". D'Oliveira received many letters of support from the public. He also received sympathetic letters from Cowdrey, Insole, Griffith and Cobham. He responded with a burst of good form, and was not drawn into publicly criticising the MCC, even offering the team his support. He signed a contract to cover the tour for the "<a href="News%20of%20the%20World">News of the World</a>" newspaper, which drew criticism from other newspapers and shook Vorster. At the time, non-whites were not allowed into South African press boxes other than "in a menial capacity"—Vorster suggested that D'Oliveira may not even be allowed on the tour as a journalist.

One of the MCC team, Tom Cartwright, had been struggling with an injury. He had considered withdrawing from the tour on moral grounds, owing to his reservations about involvement with the apartheid government. There are different versions of what actually happened. According to Cowdrey, Cartwright played without discomfort on 14 September, passed a fitness test the following day, and suddenly withdrew after an overnight reaction to his exertions, prompting the selectors to take only ten minutes to choose D'Oliveira as a replacement. Fraser-Sampson records that Cartwright actually had two fitness tests, owing to pre-existing concerns over his health; the selectors tried to persuade him not to pull out, with Cowdrey particularly insistent, but Cartwright was adamant. On 16 September, he withdrew from the MCC team, citing his injury. D'Oliveira was duly called up, a decision announced the following day. Despite having been rejected as a bowler at the earlier meeting, he was now replacing a bowler in the team; the selectors stated that D'Oliveira's bowling might prove useful. Oborne's assessment of the decision is that "they had had enough and were bowing to public opinion." Williams comments that the belated addition of D'Oliveira in the wake of outcry at his exclusion confirmed in the minds of many that politics had been involved in the team selection. Denis Howell felt the need to state publicly that the decision was the MCC's alone, and that there had been no pressure from the UK government. D'Oliveira was pleased but suspected that the tour would no longer go ahead.

In South Africa, Vorster heard that D'Oliveira had been added to the team shortly before addressing the Orange Free State National Party congress at <a href="Bloemfontein">Bloemfontein</a> on 17 September. He immediately announced that the English team would not be allowed into South Africa if it included D'Oliveira. He told the gathering that while "we are and always have been prepared to play host to the MCC ... [we] are not prepared to receive a team thrust upon us by people whose interests are not the game, but to gain certain political objectives which they do not even attempt to hide". To loud applause, he went on to describe the revised MCC team as "not the team of the MCC but the team of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the team of SANROC [the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee] and the team of <a href="Ambrose%20Reeves">Bishop Reeves</a> [a critic of apartheid]." Vorster expressed similar sentiments elsewhere, accusing the MCC of making a purely political decision. He insisted that he "had taken a decision for South Africa". The South African press was mostly critical of Vorster, warning that his stand might lead to the country's exclusion from international sport, but Professor Bruce Murray comments that the MCC's initial exclusion of D'Oliveira, only to then include him instead of a bowler, had given Vorster some ammunition to claim that the MCC selection was politically charged. Including D'Oliveira from the start would, by contrast, have forced Vorster to reveal that his plan to allow mixed teams was false.

In England, Griffith responded that the tour would be cancelled were D'Oliveira not allowed to play, and that he was in the team on merit having missed selection first time around by "a bee's whisker". Cowdrey, meanwhile, proposed flying to South Africa himself to safeguard the tour but the South African minister <a href="Ben%20Schoeman">Ben Schoeman</a> said that D'Oliveira had been chosen because of politics and that South Africa would make no deal to let him play. Coy and Cheetham flew secretly to London to try to find a compromise. They held a four-hour meeting with the MCC committee on 24 September, directly after which the committee announced that "the side selected to represent MCC in South Africa is not acceptable for reasons beyond the control of the SACA. The MCC committee therefore decided unanimously that the tour will not take place." Williams argues that the delay in cancelling the tour suggests that some in the MCC might still have hoped to find common ground with the South Africans. D'Oliveira briefly considered withdrawing from the team to save the series, but decided not to.

Sheppard and other MCC rebels called a Special General Meeting of the MCC; they wanted the MCC to state publicly that the team selection had been mishandled and that no further cricket should take place with South Africa until cricket there had been made non-racial. Before the meeting took place, the General Committee met the rebels and initially claimed that it would have been inappropriate to ask South Africa about D'Oliveira before the tour—although they had done so. The committee then admitted writing a letter but said that they had never received a reply. The Special General Meeting took place in December 1968, but the rebels were outvoted by the other members; Sheppard was criticised by members at the meeting, and his former friend Peter May refused to talk to him afterwards. Those opposing Sheppard suggested that he opposed apartheid whereas the committee wanted to advance cricket. It was also suggested that the MCC should not act as the conscience of Great Britain. Williams suggests that the vote indicated that a high proportion of the MCC favoured maintaining cricketing links with South Africa despite knowing that South African cricket operated racial segregation.

Coming just after New Zealand abandoned their 1967 rugby tour over South Africa's refusal to accommodate a mixed team, the cancellation of the 1968–69 MCC series over D'Oliveira marked the second such incident in two years. According to Oborne, the affair forced upon South African cricket a realisation that it had to change. In 1969, the <a href="South%20African%20Cricket%20Board%20of%20Control">South African Cricket Board of Control</a> (SACBOC) announced that future teams would be racially integrated and selected purely on merit; efforts duly began to allow all races to compete against each other and share facilities. This led to some disagreement among non-white sports organisations between those who supported these incremental changes and those who wanted immediate disbanding of the old system. D'Oliveira, a member of the first group, was partly drawn into this conflict. He also faced criticism from those in South Africa and England who believed that, to oppose apartheid, he should have declared himself unavailable to tour in the first place. With the tour to South Africa cancelled, the MCC hastily arranged for its team to play a Test series in Pakistan instead. D'Oliveira played and was very successful. He remained an England regular for four more years and played for Worcestershire until 1979.

In 1969, many of the events from the previous year became public knowledge, including the deceptions of Allen, Griffith and Gilligan. The MCC committee met and granted retrospective approval to the actions of the four men. Griffith's offer to resign was declined. The press outcry of 1968 was not repeated; Fraser-Sampson speculates that the MCC may have applied pressure to journalists. Griffith and Allen later received <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">honours</a> from the British government.

Controversy continued to flare in Britain and other countries regarding sporting links with South Africa. The <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">South Africa rugby team</a>'s <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland</a> was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people tried to stop the South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying down in the middle of the street. The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's <a href="1971%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australia">1971 tour</a> led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, all of which prompted the <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Cricket Board</a> to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.

South Africa was thereafter almost totally isolated from international cricket, but not from rugby. The <a href="Australian%20Rugby%20Union">Australian Rugby Union</a> severed ties with South Africa after the turbulent 1971 series, but its counterparts in New Zealand, France and the <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a> retained links into the 1980s. With Māori and <a href="Samoans">Samoan</a> players officially designated "<a href="honorary%20white">honorary white</a>s" by the South African government, mixed-race New Zealand rugby teams toured South Africa in <a href="1970%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20South%20Africa">1970</a> and <a href="1976%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20South%20Africa">1976</a>. The SACBOC formally integrated South African cricket in 1976, but enduring overseas opposition to South Africa's internal governance meant that the country did not play official international cricket again until 1991, after the start of the process to dismantle apartheid.

Blakeney Chapel

Blakeney Chapel is a ruined building on the <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> coast of <a href="England">England</a>. Despite its name, it is in the <a href="parish">parish</a> of <a href="Cley%20next%20the%20Sea">Cley next the Sea</a>, not the adjoining village of <a href="Blakeney%2C%20Norfolk">Blakeney</a>, and was probably not a <a href="chapel">chapel</a>. The building stood on a raised mound or "eye" on the seaward end of the coastal marshes, less than from the sea and just to the north of the current channel of the <a href="River%20Glaven">River Glaven</a> where it turns to run parallel to the shoreline. It consisted of two rectangular rooms of unequal size, and appears to be intact in a 1586 map, but is shown as ruins in later charts. Only the foundations and part of a wall still remain. Three <a href="archaeology">archaeological</a> investigations between 1998 and 2005 provided more detail of the construction, and showed two distinct periods of active use. Although it is described as a chapel on several maps, there is no documentary or archaeological evidence to suggest that it had any religious function. A small <a href="hearth">hearth</a>, probably used for <a href="smelting">smelting</a> iron, is the only evidence of a specific activity on the site.

Much of the structural material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney. The surviving ruins are protected as a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a> and <a href="Listed%20building%23Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade II listed building</a> because of their historical importance, but there is no active management. The ever-present threat from the encroaching sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven's course through the marshes, and lead to the loss of the ruins.

The Blakeney Chapel ruins consist of an east-west rectangular structure (S1) in size with a smaller rectangular building (S2), built onto the southern side of the main room. Most of the structure is buried, only a length of a <a href="flint">flint</a> and mortar wall being exposed to a height of prior to the excavation of 2004–05. The ruins stand on the highest point of Blakeney Eye at about above sea level. The Eye is a sandy mound in the <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es that is located inside the sea wall at the point where the <a href="River%20Glaven">River Glaven</a> turns westward towards the sheltered inlet of <a href="Blakeney%20Haven">Blakeney Haven</a>. Cley Eye is a similar raised area on the east bank of the river. Despite the name, Blakeney Eye, like most of the northern part of the marshes in this area, is actually part of the parish of Cley next the Sea.

The land on which the building stands was in the possession of the <a href="Baron%20Calthorpe">Calthorpe family</a> until its purchase by banker <a href="Charles%20Rothschild">Charles Rothschild</a> in 1912. Rothschild gave the property to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>, which has managed it since. There is no public access to the site.

The ruins are protected as a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a> and <a href="Listed%20building%23Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade II listed building</a> because of their historical importance. These listings do not cover the land around them, but the whole of the marsh forms part of the <a href="North%20Norfolk%20Coast%20Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">North Norfolk Coast</a> <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) because of its internationally important wildlife value. The SSSI is now additionally protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) and <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">RAMSAR</a> listings, and is part of the <a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20AONB">Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB).

The building was first shown on a 1586 map of the Blakeney and Cley area, apparently drawn to be used in evidence in a legal case regarding the rights to "<a href="marine%20salvage">wreck and salvage</a>", the outcome of which is unknown. The original map disappeared in the 19th century, but a number of copies still exist. In this map, the building on the Eye is shown as intact and roofed, but it has no name. A map by the Cranefields from 1769 has the building as "Eye House", but by 1797 <a href="cartography">cartographer</a> William Faden's map of Norfolk shows the "chapel ruins", a description that was then consistently used from the 19th century onwards. Some maps, including Faden's, show a second ruined chapel across the Glaven on Cley Eye, but no other documentation exists for that building.

The medieval churches of <a href="St%20Nicholas%2C%20Blakeney">St Nicholas, Blakeney</a> and <a href="St%20Margaret%27s%2C%20Cley">St Margaret's, Cley</a>, and the now ruined Blakeney <a href="monastery">friary</a>, were not the first religious buildings in the area. An early church was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at "Esnuterle" ("Snitterley" was a former name for Blakeney, the current name first appearing in 1340), but the 11th-century church's location is unknown, and there is no reason to think that it is on the site of the 'chapel'.

An anonymous booklet on Blakeney published in 1929 states that there was a "<a href="chapel%20of%20ease">chapel of ease</a>" on the marshes, served by a <a href="friar">friar</a> from the Convent, but the document on which this seems to be based, a Calendar of <a href="Patent%20Rolls">Patent Rolls</a> dated 20 April 1343, simply notes that a local hermit was given permission to seek <a href="alms">alms</a> in "divers parts of the realms". There is no evidence of a dedication of any religious building on the marshes, and no mention of a chapel in any surviving medieval documents.

The first investigation of the chapel ruins, supported by the National Trust, was conducted by the local history group in the winter of 1998–99. This survey was conducted under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation, so it relied on height measurements, <a href="geophysics">geophysics</a> (<a href="Electrical%20resistivity%20and%20conductivity">resistivity</a>, and <a href="magnetometer">magnetometry</a>) and <a href="molehill">molehill</a> sampling. The area surveyed was 100 m long and 40 m wide (109 yd by 44 yd). The magnetometry failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel, but did show an unexpected linear anomaly, related to buried ironwork from <a href="World%20War%20II">wartime</a> defences. The resistivity survey clearly showed the larger room, but barely detected the smaller, suggesting that it had less substantial foundations, was probably less well-constructed, and possibly later in date.

Plans for a realignment of the Glaven channel meant that the Eye would be left unprotected to the north of the river, and would eventually be destroyed by coastal change. It was decided that the only practical course of action was to investigate the site while it still existed, and a preliminary evaluation was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004–05. The surveyed area covered 10 ha (25 acre), significantly more than the 0.4 ha (1 acre) of the 1998 investigations. 50 trenches were excavated in a <a href="herringbone%20pattern">herringbone pattern</a> outside the buildings, each 50 m long and 1.80 m wide (194 by 5.9 ft), and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel. The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches. The geology was investigated with eight <a href="borehole">borehole</a>s, and geophysics (magnetometry and <a href="metal%20detector">metal detection</a>) were used to locate subsurface anomalies.

The major excavation of the site in the winter of 2004–05 concentrated on the building and a 10 m (33 ft) zone surrounding it. The results indicated that there were a number of phases of occupation. The remains of the building were reburied after excavation, so nothing is now visible at the surface.

The earliest evidence of permanent occupation is a series of ditches of 11th or 12th century date which are believed to have formed an enclosure, the south east corner of which lies below the "chapel". Evidence for any buildings within the enclosure has either been lost to the Glaven or is buried outside the survey area. Few finds were associated with the ditches, although some fragments of <a href="Ancient%20Roman%20pottery">Roman</a> or earlier pottery and three <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> <a href="History%20of%20the%20English%20penny%20%281154%E2%80%931485%29">pennies</a> were found nearby. As elsewhere on the site, there is little evidence to link the old pottery to its location when found. By the time of the construction of the main building, some time in the 14th century, the ditches had filled with sand. A small <a href="hearth">hearth</a> was built at ground level, shortly before or during the erection of S1. It appears to have had fairly light use, but the presence of <a href="slag">slag</a> suggests that it was intended for <a href="smelting">smelting</a> iron, perhaps by a <a href="Smith%20%28metalwork%29">smith</a>. There was evidence for a number of small fires elsewhere in S1 at a similar date to the hearth, but whether they were related to the smelting is unknown. At this time, hearths could not melt metallic iron, but produced a 'bloom' (a mixture of iron and slag) which could be converted to <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> by repeated heating and hammering. Another, even earlier, smelting hearth is known from <a href="West%20Runton">West Runton</a>, 17 km (10 mi) further east on the Norfolk coast. The main <a href="ore">ore</a> in this area is the iron-rich local <a href="carrstone">carrstone</a>.

The larger north building was built without deep foundation trenches, but was nevertheless a solid, well-built flint and mortar construction. The building had "substantial time and money spent on it" in the opinion of the principal archaeologist. The flints were selected to decrease in size as the walls rose, and the internal corners were decorated with <a href="limestone">limestone</a> blocks set as <a href="quoin%20%28architecture%29">quoins</a>. Seashells were recovered, with a distribution suggesting that they were once part of the fabric of the building as <a href="galleting">galleting</a> (strengthening for the mortar). There were entrances in the west and northeast walls, and some evidence that there were once windows in the northwest and south walls. The floor was compacted soil, and the original roof material is unknown, but the presence of a few glazed floor tiles and <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemish</a> <a href="pantile%20%28roof%20material%29">pantiles</a> of a somewhat later date is consistent with a higher-status appearance. There was no internal wall at this date, but there may have been an external wooden extension to the southwest corner.

The medieval building was eventually abandoned, and much of the structural material was taken for reuse in Blakeney and Cley villages. A stone archway in Cley is traditionally believed to have come from the chapel, and would fit the western entrance, although it could have been brought from elsewhere such as the ruined Blakeney friary. The 'chapel' building was deserted around 1600, but whether the collapse of its east end was the cause or a consequence of its disuse is unknown. The main building seems to have suffered a major fire at some stage, and no wooden structures have been found. The site was flooded at least three times, subsequent to the building's collapse. At some stage, part of the western wall was lost, the steep slope where it stood suggesting that it may have been taken by the sea.

Most of the pottery found within the larger room was 14th to 16th century, nearly a third of which was imported from the continent, reflecting the Glaven ports' importance in international trade at this time. The pottery appeared to be mainly domestic in nature, including jugs and cooking vessels.

The 17th-century room, S2, used the south wall of the existing structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double fireplace, but there was no evidence of a dividing wall between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in the fireplace. In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were <a href="Cornwall">Cornish</a> slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.

At the same time that S2 was built, a dividing wall, again of inferior quality, was built across S1 to create a western room. There were no molehills within the smaller building, which had suggested that, unlike its neighbour, it has a buried solid floor, and this was confirmed by excavation. This had a floor originally made of mortar, relaid at least once, but then covered with a layer of flint <a href="cobblestone">cobbles</a>, suggesting that it was a working area. The old hearth was not covered, so it may have still been used. A new fireplace was also added, apparently of a domestic design, although the context makes that function improbable. A well-marked track led southwest down the slope from S1, and a large <a href="midden">midden</a> was close to the path. It has been suggested that a "clean" pit north of S1 was a well, with <a href="Lens%20%28hydrology%29">fresh water floating</a> above the saltwater below, a phenomenon known from <a href="Blakeney%20Point">Blakeney Point</a> and elsewhere on the Norfolk coast.

There is only limited evidence for use after the 17th-century desertion, including a 19th-century <a href="Smoking%20pipe%20%28tobacco%29">tobacco pipe</a> and some <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> glassware. A wartime <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> fence ran through the ruins, and was detected by excavation and magnetometry. Other modern finds included a <a href="gin%20trap">gin trap</a>, bullets and other small metal objects.

Blakeney Eye has a long history of occupation, with many finds from the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>, but few from <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> or <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon</a> dates, although a gold <a href="bracteate">bracteate</a> was a rare and significant 6th-century find. Animal and plant finds showed that both domesticated species, such as <a href="goat">goat</a>s, and locally available prey such as <a href="Eurasian%20Curlew">curlews</a> were eaten; rabbit and <a href="canidae">canid</a> remains may reflect the use of fur from these mammals. Evidence of <a href="cereal">cereal</a> processing and storage is difficult to date, but may be medieval.

The buildings were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, which may have been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in numbers of people and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a <a href="custom%20house">custom house</a> or a <a href="warren%20%28domestic%29">warrener's</a> house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.

Realignment of the River Glaven means the ruins are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle</a> will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30 years.

The ridge of shingle runs west from <a href="Weybourne%2C%20Norfolk">Weybourne</a> along the Norfolk coast, before becoming a spit extending into the sea at Blakeney. Saltmarshes can develop behind the ridge, but the sea attacks the spit through tidal and storm action. The amount of shingle moved by a single storm can be "spectacular"; the spit has sometimes been breached, becoming an island for a time, and this may happen again. The northernmost part of Snitterley village was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages, probably due to a storm.

In the last two hundred years, the maps have been accurate enough for the distance from the ruins to the sea to be measured. The 400 m (440 yd) in 1817 had become 320 m (350 yd) by 1835, 275 m (300 yd) in 1907, and 195 m (215 yd) by the end of the 20th century. The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1 m (1 yd) per year; and several raised islands or "eyes" have already been lost to the sea as the beach has rolled over the saltmarsh. Landward movement of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven, itself excavated in 1922 because an earlier, more northerly course was overwhelmed between Blakeney and Cley, was becoming blocked increasingly often. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important freshwater marshes. The <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> considered a number of remedial options. Attempting to hold back the shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550 m (600 yd) stretch of river 200 m (220 yd) further south was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £1.5 million.

<a href="Managed%20retreat">Managed retreat</a> is likely to be the long-term solution to rising sea levels along much of the North Norfolk coast. It has already been implemented at other important sites like <a href="Titchwell%20Marsh">Titchwell Marsh</a>.

South Park: The Stick of Truth

South Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2014 <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> developed by <a href="Obsidian%20Entertainment">Obsidian Entertainment</a> in collaboration with <a href="South%20Park%20Digital%20Studios">South Park Digital Studios</a> and published by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>. Based on the American adult animated television series "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>", the game follows the New Kid, who has moved to the eponymous town and becomes involved in an epic role-play fantasy war involving humans, wizards, and elves, who are fighting for control of the all-powerful Stick of Truth. Their game quickly escalates out of control and brings them into conflict with aliens, <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> zombies, and gnomes, threatening the entire town with destruction.

The game is played from a <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a>, <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> perspective replicating the aesthetic of the television series. The New Kid is able to freely explore the town of South Park, interacting with characters and undertaking quests, and accessing new areas by progressing through the main story. Selecting one of four character archetypes, <a href="Warrior%20%28character%20class%29">Fighter</a>, <a href="Thief%20%28character%20class%29">Thief</a>, <a href="Wizard%20%28character%20class%29">Mage</a>, and <a href="Jew">Jew</a>, each offering specific abilities, the New Kid and a supporting party of characters use a variety of melee, ranged, and magical fart attacks to combat with their enemies.

Development began in 2009 after "South Park" creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a> approached Obsidian about making a role-playing game designed to look exactly like the television series. Parker and Stone were involved throughout the game's production: they wrote its script, consulted on the design, and as in the television program they voiced many of the characters. "The Stick of Truth"s production was turbulent; following the bankruptcy of the original publisher, <a href="THQ">THQ</a>, the rights to the game were acquired by Ubisoft in early 2013, and its release date was postponed several times from its initial date in March 2013 to its eventual release in March 2014, for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>.

"The Stick of Truth" was subject to <a href="censorship">censorship</a> in some regions because of its content, which includes abortions and Nazi imagery; Parker and Stone replaced the scenes with detailed explanations of what occurs in each scene. The game was released to positive reviews, which praised the comedic script, visual style, and faithfulness to the source material. It received criticism for a lack of challenging combat and technical issues that slowed or impeded progress. A sequel, "", was released in October 2017, and "The Stick of Truth" was re-released in February 2018, for <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>, and on <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> in September 2018.

"South Park: The Stick of Truth" is a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> that is viewed from a <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a>, <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> perspective. The player controls the New Kid as he explores the fictional Colorado town of South Park. The player can freely move around the town although some areas remain inaccessible until specific points in the story are reached. Notable characters from the series—including <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a>, <a href="Butters%20Stotch">Butters</a>, <a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a>, and <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a>—join the New Kid's party and accompany him on his quests, though only one character can be active at any time. The game features a fast travel system, allowing the player to call on the character <a href="Timmy%20Burch">Timmy</a> to quickly transport them to any other visited fast travel station. At the beginning of the game, the player selects one of four character archetypes; the <a href="Warrior%20%28character%20class%29">Fighter</a>, <a href="Thief%20%28character%20class%29">Thief</a>, <a href="Mage%20%28character%20class%29">Mage</a> (which represent standard fantasy types), and the Jew. The Jew class specializes in "Jew-jitsu" and long-range attacks. Each class has specific abilities; armor and weapons are not limited by class, allowing a Mage to focus on melee attacks like a Fighter.

The New Kid and his allies possess a variety of melee, ranged, and magic attacks. Experience points rewarded for completing tasks and winning battles allow the New Kid to level up, unlocking new abilities and upgrades such as increasing the number of enemies an attack hits or the amount of damage inflicted. Magic is represented by the characters' ability to fart; different farts are used to accomplish specific tasks. For example, the "Cup-A-Spell" allows the player to throw a fart to interact with a distant object, the "Nagasaki" destroys blockades, and the "Sneaky Squeaker" can be thrown to create a sound that distracts enemies. Attacks can be augmented with farts if the player has enough magical energy.
The player has access to unlockable abilities that can open new paths of exploration, such as shrinking to access small areas like vents, teleportation which allows the player to reach otherwise unreachable platforms, and farts which trigger an explosion that defeats nearby enemies when combined with a naked flame. Actions committed against enemies outside of battle affects them in combat; the player or opponent who strikes first to trigger a fight will have the first turn in battle. Combat takes place in a battle area separate from the open game world. Battles use turn-based gameplay and each character takes a turn to attack or defend before yielding to the next character.

During the player's turn, a radial wheel listing the available optionsclass-based basic melee attacks, special attacks, long-ranged attacks, and support itemsappears. Basic attacks are used to hit unarmored enemies and wear down shields; heavy attacks weaken armored enemies. A flashing icon indicates that attacks or blocks can be enhanced to inflict more damage,or mitigate incoming attacks more effectively. Each special attack costs a set amount of "Power Points" or "PP" (pronounced <a href="Urine">peepee</a>) to activate. Only one party member can join the player in battle. Certain characters, such as <a href="Tuong%20Lu%20Kim">Tuong Lu Kim</a>, <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Mr.%20Hankey">Mr Hankey</a>, <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Jesus">Jesus</a>, and <a href="Mr.%20Slave">Mr. Slave</a> can be summoned during battle to deliver a powerful attack capable of defeating several enemies simultaneously; Jesus sprays damaging gunfire, while Mr. Slave squeezes an enemy into his rectum, scaring his allies away.

One support item can be used each turn, including items that restore health or provide beneficial <a href="status%20effect">status effect</a>s that improve the character's abilities. Weapons and armor can be enhanced using optional "strap-ons", such as fake vampire teeth, bubble gum, or a <a href="Jewpacabra">Jewpacabra</a> claw. These items can cause enemies to bleed and lose health, weaken enemy armor, boost player health or steal health from opponents, and disgust foes to make them "grossed out" and cause them to vomit. Additionally, the "strap-ons" can set opponents on fire, electrocute them, or freeze them. Some enemies are immune to one or more of these effects. Enemies can deflect certain attacks entirely; those in a riposte stance will deflect any melee attack, requiring the use of ranged weapons, while those in reflect stance will deflect ranged weapons.

The player is encouraged to explore the wider game world to find <a href="Chinpokomon">Chinpokomon</a> toys or new friends who are added to the character's <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page. Collecting friends allows the player to unlock perks that permanently improve the New Kid's statistics, providing extra damage or resistance to negative effects. The character's Facebook page also serves as the game's main menu, containing the inventory and a quest journal. "The Stick of Truth" features several mini-games, including defecating by repeatedly tapping a button that rewards the player with feces that can be thrown at enemies to trigger the "grossed out" effect, performing an abortion, and using an anal probe. Some of these scenes are absent from some versions of the game because of censorship.

"South Park: The Stick of Truth" is set in the fictional town South Park in the Colorado <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. The main character, whom the player controls, is the New Kidnicknamed "Douchebag"a silent protagonist who has recently moved to the town. Befriending the local boys, he becomes involved in an epic role-playing fantasy game featuring wizards and warriors battling for control of the Stick of Truth, a twig that possesses limitless power.

The humans, led by Wizard King Cartman, make their home in the Kingdom of Kupa Keep, a makeshift camp built in Cartman's backyard; among their number are paladin Butters, thief <a href="Craig%20Tucker">Craig</a>, <a href="Clyde%20Donovan">Clyde</a>, cleric <a href="Token%20Black">Token</a>, <a href="Tweek%20Tweak">Tweek</a>, and <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a>a young boy who dresses as a princess. The humans' rivals are the drow elves, who live in the elven kingdom in the backyard of their leader, High Jew Elf Kyle; they also include the warrior Stan and <a href="Jimmy%20Valmer">Jimmy</a> the bard. The boys conduct their game throughout the town, the surrounding forest, and even into Canada (represented as a <a href="Pixelation">pixelated</a> overhead <a href="Fourth%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">16-bit RPG</a>). Locations from the show, including South Park Elementary, South Park Mall, the Bijou Cinema, City Wok restaurant, and Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse, are featured in the game.

"The Stick of Truth" features the following historical "South Park" characters: Stan's father <a href="Randy%20and%20Sharon%20Marsh">Randy Marsh</a>, school teacher <a href="Mr.%20Garrison">Mr. Garrison</a>, Jesus, school counsellor <a href="Mr.%20Mackey">Mr. Mackey</a>, former United States Vice-President <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a>, the <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a>-loving Mr. Slave, sentient turd <a href="Mr.%20Hankey">Mr. Hankey</a>, City Wok restaurant owner Tuong Lu Kim, Stan's uncle <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20families%23Jimbo%20Kern">Jimbo</a>, Mayor McDaniels, Priest Maxi, Skeeter, Canadian celebrities <a href="Terrance%20and%20Phillip">Terrance and Phillip</a>, the <a href="Gnomes%20%28South%20Park%29">Underpants Gnomes</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Goth%20kids">Goth kids</a>, the Ginger kids, the Crab People; the Christmas Critters, and local boys Timmy, Scott Malkinson, and Kevin Stoley.

The New Kid has moved with his parents to South Park to escape his forgotten past. He quickly allies with Butters, Princess Kenny and their leader Cartman. Nicknamed "Douchebag", the New Kid is introduced to the coveted Stick of Truth. Shortly thereafter, the elves attack Kupa Keep and take the Stick. Cartman banishes Clyde from the group for failing to defend the Stick from the elves. With the help of Cartman's best warriors, Douchebag recovers the Stick from Jimmy. That night, Douchebag and several town residents are abducted by aliens. Douchebag escapes his confinement with the help of Stan's father, Randy, and crashes the alien ship into the town's mall.

By morning, the UFO crash site has been sealed off by the government, who has put out a cover-story that claims a <a href="Taco%20Bell">Taco Bell</a> is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with recruiting the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting to blow up the town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.

That night, Cartman or Kyle (dependent on which character the player chooses to follow) leads his side against the other at the school. Here, the children learn that Clyde stole the Stick as revenge for his banishment. Clyde rallies defectors from the humans and elves, and uses the alien goo to create an army of Nazi Zombies. The humans and elves join together to oppose Clyde but there are too few to fight him. Later, Gnomes steal Douchebag's underpants; after defeating them, Douchebag gains the ability to change size at will.

Out of desperation, Douchebag is told to invite the girls to play. They agree to join after Douchebag infiltrates an abortion clinic and travels across Canada to discover which of their friends is spreading gossip. Flanked by the girls, kindergarten pirates, and "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" role-players, the humans and elves attack Clyde's dark tower. Randy arrives and reveals that the government agents have planted a nuclear device in Mr. Slave's anus to blow up South Park, forcing Douchebag to shrink and enter Mr. Slave to disarm the bomb. After exiting Mr. Slave, Douchebag finally confronts Clyde and is forced to fight a resurrected Nazi Zombie <a href="Chef%20%28South%20Park%29">Chef</a>; Chef is defeated. Clyde decides he is not playing any more and Cartman kicks him from the tower.

The government agents arrive, revealing that Douchebag went into hiding to escape them because of his ability to quickly make friends on <a href="social%20network">social network</a>s such as Facebook, which the government wanted to use for its own ends. Learning of the Stick's supposed power, the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it. Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group, uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus. Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny's balls, which he does. The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus. In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt, the group retrieves the Stick of Truth; they decide its power is too great for any person to hold and throw it into Stark's Pond.

Development of "South Park: The Stick of Truth" took four years, beginning in 2009 when "South Park" co-creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a> contacted <a href="Obsidian%20Entertainment">Obsidian Entertainment</a> to discuss their desire to make a "South Park" game. Parker, a fan of Obsidian games, including "" (2010), wanted to create a role-playing game, a genre which he and Stone had enjoyed since their childhoods. Parker and Stone insisted that the game must replicate the show's visual style. Parker's original concept was for a "South Park" version of the 2011 role-playing fantasy game "", and he estimated the first script he produced to be 500 pages long. The <a href="South%20Park%23Video%20games">South Park Digital Studios</a> team animated a concept of the game's opening scene to show what they wanted to accomplish with Obsidian in terms of appearance and gameplay mechanics. While the series had inspired several licensed games, such as "<a href="South%20Park%20%28video%20game%29">South Park</a>" (1998) and "<a href="South%20Park%20Rally">South Park Rally</a>" (1999), Parker and Stone were not involved in these games' development and later criticized the titles' quality. Negative reaction to those games made the pair protective of their property and led to their greater involvement on "The Stick of Truth"; they refused several requests to license the series for new ventures.

Stone and Parker worked closely with Obsidian on the project, sometimes having two-to-three hour meetings over four consecutive days. They worked with Obsidian until two weeks before the game was shipped. Their involvement extended beyond creative input; their company initially financed the game, believing that a game based on the controversial television show would struggle to receive financial support from publishers without them placing restrictions on the content to make it more marketable. The initial funding was intended to allow Obsidian to develop enough of the game to show a more complete concept to potential publishers. In December 2011, THQ announced that they would work with Obsidian on "South Park: The Game", as it was then known. This partnership developed into a publishing arrangement after "South Park" owner Viacom, having grown wary of video games, cut its funding. Obsidian was aware when it signed with THQ that the latter was experiencing financial difficulties.

In March 2012, Microsoft canceled Obsidian's upcoming <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> project codenamed "North Carolina" after seven months of development, resulting in the layoff of between 20 and 30 employees, including members of the "Stick of Truth" team. In May 2012, the game's final title was announced. In December 2012, THQ filed for <a href="chapter%2011%20bankruptcy">chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> after suffering several product release failures. "The Stick of Truth" remained on schedule as THQ tried to use the bankruptcy period to restructure and return its business to profit, but the company failed to find a buyer and a Delaware court ordered that THQ was worth more if its assets were sold individually.

The rights to "The Stick of Truth" were auctioned in late December 2012; Obsidian was not made aware of the sale until the auction was announced. South Park Digital Studios filed an objection to the auction, stating that THQ did not have the authority to sell the publishing rights and that THQ had been granted exclusive use of specific "South Park" trademarks and copyrights. South Park Digital also argued that even if the rights were sold, THQ would still owe them and that they held the option of reclaiming all elements of the game and "South Park" related creations. THQ requested that the court overrule South Park Digital, stating that their rights were exclusive and thus transferable. On January 24, 2013, the United States bankruptcy court approved the sale of THQ's assets, including "The Stick of Truth".

The rights were bought by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> for . Within three weeks they had decided that the game required significant changes, pushing its release date back by six months to March 2014. Parker and Stone, with input from a Ubisoft creative consultant, concluded that their original vision would take too long and would be too costly to produce. In a 2014 interview, Obsidian leader <a href="Feargus%20Urquhart">Feargus Urquhart</a> said he could not comment on changes that were made following Ubisoft's involvement. "South Park: The Stick of Truth" was officially <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle%23Release%20to%20manufacturing%20%28RTM%29">released to manufacturing</a> on February 12, 2014. Following its release, Stone said that the work involved in making the game was much more than he and Parker had anticipated. He said, "I'll [admit] to the fact that we retooled stuff that we didn't like and we worked on the game longer than other people would've liked us to".

During early discussions with Obsidian, Parker and Stone were adamant that the game should faithfully replicate the show's unique 2D-style visuals, which are based on <a href="cutout%20animation">cutout animation</a>. Obsidian provided <a href="Proof%20of%20concept">proofs of concept</a> that they could achieve the "South Park" look; Stone and Parker were satisfied with this. The show is animated using <a href="Autodesk%20Maya">Autodesk Maya</a>, but Obsidian produced the game assets and animations in <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Adobe Flash</a>. "Skyrim" was the game's initial influence and further inspiration came from the 1994 role-playing game "<a href="EarthBound">EarthBound</a>". Parker and Stone said that the blended 2D/3D visuals of "<a href="Paper%20Mario">Paper Mario</a>" and the silent protagonist <a href="Link%20%28The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%29">Link</a> from "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>" series also provided inspiration for the design. The characters' costumes and classes are taken from the 2002 "South Park" episode "<a href="The%20Return%20of%20the%20Fellowship%20of%20the%20Ring%20to%20the%20Two%20Towers">The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers</a>". Obsidian created various fantasy-styled items, armor, and weapons but Parker and Stone told them to "make it crappier" to create the impression that the children had found or made the objects themselves; weapons consisted of golf clubs, hammers, suction cup arrows and wooden swords, while bathrobes, oven mitt gloves, and towels worn as capes served as clothing. "South Park" studios provided Obsidian with access to the show's full archive of art assets, allowing Obsidian to include previously unused ideas, such as discarded Chinpokomon designs. Actors from the show provided voice work, and Obsidian was given access to "South Park"s audio resources, including sound effects, music, and the show's composer Jamie Dunlap.

Describing the writing of a comedy script for a game in which lines of dialog may be heard repeatedly and jokes could appear dated, Stone said:

We write jokes, and the jokes are funny. With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, and then you question it, and you go round this emotional circle ... We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny "South Park" scenes, hopefully it's more than that.

Like the show, "The Stick of Truth" satirizes political and social issues including abortion, race relations, anal probes, drug addiction, sex, extreme violence, and poverty. Creative consultant Jordan Thomas said, "The way we looked at [humor] was if this moment was a hot button for the audience, should we make it worse, because [Stone and Parker] love to push boundaries and their default response was definitely not to back down, but the really healthy counterbalance was, can we make it funnierand the answer was often yes".

The game underwent several changes during its development. While the final game features four playable character types (Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew), an early version featured five playable classes: Paladin, Wizard, Rogue, Adventurer, and Jew. The latter was described as a cross between a <a href="Monk%20%28character%20class%29">Monk</a> and a <a href="Paladin%20%28character%20class%29">Paladin</a>, that is "high risk, high reward" and strongest when closest to death. The game had included other enemies and locations, including vampire children who were fought in a cemetery and church, hippies, a mission to recover Cartman's doll from the Ginger children, and boss fights against a large, winged monster, and celebrity <a href="Paris%20Hilton">Paris Hilton</a>her main attack being called the "vag blast". The Crab People had a larger role and shared a demilitarized zone with the Underpants Gnomesonly one Crab Person appears in the final gameand Mr Hankey and his family lived in a large, Christmas-themed village which became a small house in the town's sewers. Urquhart later said that when development began, video games were less protected by freedom of speech laws than other media, restricting the content that could be included in "The Stick of Truth". While under THQ's publishing deal, the developers planned that the Xbox 360 version would support the console's input device, <a href="Kinect">Kinect</a>, enabling players to give characters voice commands, taunt enemies, and insult Cartmanto which the character would respond. Exclusive Xbox 360 <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC) including the "Mysterion Superhero" pack and "<a href="Good%20Times%20with%20Weapons">Good Times with Weapons</a>" packs each featuring a unique weapon, outfit, and special attack, and three story-based campaign expansions was announced. These features were not present in the Ubisoft release.

"South Park: The Stick of Truth" was released in North America on March 4, 2014, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and Microsoft Windows. It was released on March 6 in Australia and on March 7 in Europe. The game had been scheduled for release on March 5, 2013, but this was postponed two months by then-publisher THQ. After THQ filed for bankruptcy in January 2013, Ubisoft purchased the rights to publish the game and did not specify a release date. By May 2013, Ubisoft had confirmed that it would be released that year after it was omitted from their upcoming games release schedule. On September 26, 2013, Ubisoft announced that "The Stick of Truth" would be released in December 2013, but in October 2013 the game's release was again postponed until March 2014. The game was scheduled for release on March 6, 2014 in Germany and Austria, but it was delayed after the localized version of the game was found to contain Nazi references. Alongside the <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> version of the game, "The Stick of Truth" received a digital download release for <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> on June 13, 2016. The console versions were only available as a free pre-order incentive to customers who pre-ordered its sequel, "The Fractured But Whole". A stand-alone physical and digital download was released on for February 13, 2018, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> version, available as a digital download, was released on September 25, 2018.

A collector's edition called the "Grand Wizard Edition" containing the game, a 6-inch figure of Grand Wizard Cartman created by <a href="Kidrobot">Kidrobot</a>, a map of the South Park kingdom, and the "Ultimate Fellowship" DLC was made available. The "Ultimate Fellowship" content includes four outfits with different abilities; the Necromancer Sorcerer outfit provides increased fire damage, the Rogue Assassin outfit rewards the player with extra money, the Ranger Elf outfit raises weapon damage, and the Holy Defender outfit increases defense. Additional content included the "Super Samurai Spaceman" pack containing three outfits; the Superhero costume provides a buff at the start of battle, the Samurai costume provides a buff on defeating an enemy, and the Spaceman costume provides a defensive shield.

In November and December 2013, the "South Park" television series featured the "Black Friday" trilogy of episodes"<a href="Black%20Friday%20%28South%20Park%29">Black Friday</a>", "<a href="A%20Song%20of%20Ass%20and%20Fire">A Song of Ass and Fire</a>", and "<a href="Titties%20and%20Dragons">Titties and Dragons</a>"which was a narrative prequel to the game and featured the characters wearing outfits and acting out roles similar to those in the game. The episodes satirized the game's lengthy development; in "Black Friday" Cartman tells Kyle not to "pre-order a game that some assholes in California haven’t even finished making yet", referring to California-based Obsidian, while "Titties and Dragons" concludes with an advertisement announcing the game's release date accompanied by Butters declaring his skepticism. Discussing "Black Friday", <a href="IGN">IGN</a> said that it "felt like a sneak peek" of the game and if nothing else, was "good marketing" in light of the game's numerous delays.

Shortly before the game's release, Ubisoft announced that it would voluntarily censor seven scenes, calling it a "market decision made by Ubisoft EMEA" and not a response to input from censors. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were affected in European territories, the Middle East, Africa, and Russia, while the Microsoft Windows version remained uncensored. The censorship affected all formats in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, Austria, and Taiwan. The North American release was the only version that was uncensored on all formats. The German version was specifically censored because of the use of Nazi and Hitler-related imagery, including swastikas and Nazi salutes, which are illegal in that country. A spokesman for the European video game content rating system <a href="Pan%20European%20Game%20Information">Pan European Game Information</a> (PEGI) confirmed that the uncensored version had been submitted and approved for release with an 18 rating, meaning the game would be acceptable for people over eighteen years of age. Ubisoft resubmitted the censored version without input from PEGI; this version was passed with an 18-rating.

The scenes Ubisoft removed depict anal probing by aliens and the player-character performing an abortion. In their place, the game displays a still image of a statue <a href="Facepalm">holding its face in its hand</a>, with an explicit description of events depicted in the scene. In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the <a href="Australian%20Classification%20Board">Australian Classification Board</a> refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violencespecifically the child player-character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background image of a koala crying.

Discussing the situation, Stone said he had been told changes were required for the game to be released and that he and Parker inserted the placeholder images so the censorship would not be hidden. He called the censorship a double standard that the pair resisted, and said he felt it did not ruin the game and the cards allowed them to mock the changes. A post-release user-created game modification was released for the Microsoft Windows version that disabled the censorship.

"South Park: The Stick of Truth" received positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> provides a score of 85 out of 100 from 48 critics for the Microsoft Windows version, 85 out of 100 from 31 critics for the PlayStation 3 version, and 82 out of 100 from 33 critics for the Xbox 360 version.

The game was considered a successful adaptation of licensed material to a video game, with critics describing it as one of the most faithful video game adaptations ever, such that moving the player-character was like walking on the set of the show. <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> said that "The Stick of Truth" was to "South Park" as "" was to the "Batman" franchise in terms of reverence to the source material while breaking new ground in video games. They praised the "open-world South Park to explore, with a solid 12–14 hours of inside jokes, obscure references, and humor that pulls from 17 TV seasons' worth of social commentary and offensive humor." "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" said that the game contained so many references to the show's history that it made "" appear sparse. <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> said that the ability to walk around the detailed town provided a sense of wonderment similar to exploring <a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> home town in "". The visual translation was highlighted as a significant component of the game's success, appearing indistinguishable from an episode of the show and providing a consistent aesthetic that remained faithful to the series while being original to gaming. Some reviewers said that the art style was occasionally detrimental, obscuring objects and prompts, and that repetitive use of animations grew stale over the course of the game. "Computer and Video Games" said that Obsidian had built a game world that seemed as though it had always existed.

Reviewers consistently highlighted its comedic achievement. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" said it is frequently hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised "The Stick of Truth" for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said that as well as being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to "South Park" fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game "South Park" fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the "South Park" license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.

Combat received a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, and others said that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said that a lack of depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, by the end of the game the battles can become routine. <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.

IGN said that the difference between character classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal, offering little variety or incentive to replay as another class. IGN also said some missions and side quests were tedious, and were elevated by their setting rather than their quality, while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and were rare enough to be enjoyable when available. However, GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple. Reviewers said that many of the gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.

Mathew Charles Lamb

Mathew Charles "Matt" Lamb (5 January 1948 – 7 November 1976) was a Canadian <a href="spree%20killer">spree killer</a> who, in 1967, avoided Canada's <a href="capital%20punishment%20in%20Canada">then-mandatory death penalty</a> for <a href="Murder">capital murder</a> by being found <a href="mental%20disorder%20defence">not guilty by reason of insanity</a>. Abandoned by his teenage mother soon after his birth in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Ontario">Windsor</a>, Ontario, Lamb suffered an abusive upbringing at the hands of his step-grandfather, leading him to become emotionally detached from his relatives and peers. He developed violent tendencies that manifested themselves in his physical assault of a police officer at the age of 16 in February 1964, and his engaging in a brief shoot-out with law enforcement ten months later. After this latter incident he spent 14 months, starting in April 1965, at <a href="Kingston%20Penitentiary">Kingston Penitentiary</a>, a <a href="Correctional%20Service%20of%20Canada%23Security%20classification%20of%20offenders">maximum security prison</a> in eastern Ontario.

Seventeen days after his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a shooting spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's <a href="Criminal%20Code%20%28Canada%29">Criminal Code</a> called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, that he had not been sane at the time of the incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at <a href="Mental%20Health%20Centre%20Penetanguishene">Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre</a>'s Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the <a href="Executive%20Council%20of%20Ontario">Executive Council of Ontario</a> that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker.

Lamb continued to show improvement, becoming a productive labourer on Barker's farm and earning the trust of the doctor's family. With Barker's encouragement, Lamb joined the <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">Rhodesian Army</a> in late 1973 and fought for the <a href="list%20of%20historical%20unrecognized%20states">unrecognised</a> government of <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> (modern-day Zimbabwe) for the rest of his life. He started his service in the <a href="Rhodesian%20Light%20Infantry">Rhodesian Light Infantry</a>, and won a place in the crack <a href="Rhodesian%20Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> unit in 1975, but was granted a transfer back to his former regiment a year later. Soon after he was promoted to <a href="Lance%20corporal">lance-corporal</a>, Lamb was <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men. He received what "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" called "a hero's funeral" in the Rhodesian capital, <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, before his ashes were returned to Windsor and buried by his relatives.

Mathew Charles Lamb was born in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Ontario">Windsor</a>, Ontario on 5 January 1948, the only child of a 15-year-old mother who abandoned him soon after birth. Raised by an assortment of grandparents, aunts and uncles, he rarely saw his mother while growing up and never knew his father, who died in the United States while Lamb was young. Lamb spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandmother and her new husband Christopher Collins at their home on York Street in the South Central neighbourhood of Windsor, where his presence was resented by the step-grandfather Collins. According to interviews with relatives, friends and neighbours conducted by Lamb's legal counsel Saul Nosanchuk in the mid-1960s, Collins subjected the boy to sustained emotional and physical abuse, beating him and frequently calling him a "little <a href="wikt%3Abastard">bastard</a>". The direction of this violence was not limited to Lamb himself, however; he often witnessed his step-grandfather and grandmother fighting while he was still a small boy.

Lamb started exhibiting violent traits of his own from an early age. Nosanchuk writes that the young boy lured his cousins into his bedroom, locked them in a closet and threatened them. On one occasion he followed through with these threats and beat one of his cousins so badly that medical attention was required at a local hospital. "I remember once," said Greg Sweet, a childhood friend, "when he was about seven years old, he held a knife to a smaller kid and made him eat dog faeces". Lamb first attended Colbourne School in <a href="Tecumseh%2C%20Ontario">Tecumseh</a>, where Collins later said he appeared to be normal. School staff agreed, later telling the "<a href="Windsor%20Star">Windsor Star</a>" that he rarely got into trouble, and was capable, but unable to concentrate for extended periods.

Starting with <a href="Eighth%20grade%23Canada%20and%20the%20United%20States">Grade 8</a>, when he was 13, Lamb went to St Jude's School in Windsor, where the other pupils found him to be distant and quiet. According to a fellow pupil, he spurned attempts by the other children to include him in their social circles. For example, Lamb once refused an invitation to a party, saying that he "didn't like to dance." Developing a keen interest in weapons, Lamb began to carry a knife to school, which he had little hesitation in showing off. He also became fascinated with firearms; according to Sweet, he and Lamb "always had guns, from the time [they] were about 12 years old". Sweet later told the "Windsor Star" that police were not informed when, as a teenager, Lamb strolled down a residential street "firing a shotgun at the houses of people he didn't like". Sweet also said that around this time Lamb assembled a collection of bullets and wrote the names of various local policemen on them. Lamb's hobby even extended to crude bombs, which he taught himself to produce using parts of various weapons. When he accidentally detonated one of these concoctions during preparation his leg was sprayed with shrapnel.

On 10 February 1964, barely a month after he turned 16, Lamb confronted a physically imposing police sergeant outside the <a href="Windsor%20Arena">Windsor Arena</a> and, in front of a large crowd of people, leapt upon the far larger man and repeatedly punched him in the face. According to journalist Bob Sutton's account in the "Windsor Star" (published three years later), Lamb did this "for no apparent reason". Lamb was convicted of assault under the <a href="Juvenile%20Delinquents%20Act">Juvenile Delinquents Act</a> and served six months at the House of Concord, a young offenders' unit near <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London</a>, Ontario, run by the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a>. Upon his release, Lamb was sent by his step-grandfather to live in East Windsor with his uncle, Earl Hesketh. With Hesketh's support, Lamb briefly attended <a href="Assumption%20College%20School">Assumption College School</a>, where apart from a dislike for learning Latin, he performed creditably. However, with no real motivation to study, the boy soon dropped out to look for work. He was unable to hold down a permanent job and drifted through a series of short-term engagements, none lasting more than three months.

On the evening of 24 December 1964, Lamb smashed the front window of Lakeview Marine and Equipment, a sporting goods store in Tecumseh, and stole three revolvers and a double-barrelled shotgun. Using one of the revolvers, he fired twice on a police constable and the shop's co-owner, missing both times. The officer returned several shots, leading Lamb to come forward with his hands raised. "Don't shoot. I give up," he said. He then showed the constable where he had hidden the other two handguns and the shotgun. Lamb, who turned 17 during the trial, was tried and convicted as an adult for "breaking, entering and theft ... [and] possession of a .22 calibre revolver, dangerous to public peace". Motivated by a <a href="presentence%20investigation%20report">presentence investigation report</a> characterising Lamb as exceptionally violent, Magistrate J. Arthur Hanrahan sentenced him to two years at <a href="Kingston%20Penitentiary">Kingston Penitentiary</a>, a <a href="Correctional%20Service%20of%20Canada%23Security%20classification%20of%20offenders">maximum security prison</a>. According to Nosanchuk's account, the severity of the sentence was unusual for a first-time adult offender who had not caused anybody physical harm. Hanrahan, Nosanchuk writes, must have deemed Lamb beyond rehabilitation. The boy arrived at the penitentiary in April 1965.
Psychiatric examinations and psychological tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature young man who was strongly drawn to weapons. The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour. Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of "an obvious mental breakdown". Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a broom handle into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so. "I think this young man is developing a mental illness of <a href="hypomania">hypomanic</a> nature," he wrote in his report. In further interviews conducted by Scott, Lamb related what the doctor described as "elaborate fantasies involving robberies, fights, and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility".

Lamb attempted suicide several times and for years afterwards bore scars where he had tried to slit his wrists. According to Nosanchuk, by early March 1966 the prisoner's behaviour "bordered on <a href="psychosis">psychotic</a>". During this month he threw food at an officer and was once again found with a broomstick in his rectum, this time dragging it around the floor of his cell and laughing. When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident, the boy said he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty. Scott once again noted his concern that Lamb was developing a hypomanic condition, a mania of low intensity, and on 18 March committed him to Kingston Psychiatric Hospital for a month. Scott wrote in his report to the hospital that he was not sure whether Lamb's condition was genuine or whether he was just putting on an act.

Lamb returned to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into <a href="recidivism">recidivism</a>. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, but at the same time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as "borderline" or "marginal". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the boy could just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.

Seventeen days after his release from Kingston Penitentiary, on the evening of 25 June 1966, Lamb discovered a shotgun in his uncle's house. He took the weapon and left the house shortly before 22:00 <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Time</a>, then walked a single block north along Ford Boulevard and hid behind a tree outside number 1872. Six young people—Edith Chaykoski, 20, her 22-year-old brother Kenneth, his wife and three friends, 21-year-old Andrew Woloch, Vincent Franco and Don Mulesa—were heading south from 1635 Ford Boulevard on their way to a bus stop on Tecumseh Road when they approached the tree behind which Lamb was hiding at about 22:15. Lamb suddenly stepped out in front of the strangers, pointed the shotgun at them and said "Stop. Put up your hands!" When Edith Chaykoski stepped forward, towards Lamb, he shot her in the abdomen. Woloch then moved and was hit in the stomach by a second shot, which also wounded Kenneth Chaykoski. Lamb then ran across the street to 1867 Ford Boulevard and fired on a girl whose silhouette he had spotted in a side doorway of the house; his target, 19-year-old Grace Dunlop, was injured. As law enforcement and medical assistance were summoned, Lamb strolled away and walked two blocks before knocking on a door, which he had seemingly chosen at random. Pointing the shotgun at the elderly lady who lived there, Ann Heaton, he threatened to kill her. When Heaton cried out to her husband Forrest to phone the police, Lamb fled, throwing the shotgun over the old couple's fence into a field. He returned to the Hesketh house and went to sleep.

Edith Chaykoski died from her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the neighbourhood during the morning and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's and concluded that the 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a <a href="spree%20killer">shooting spree</a> the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the <a href="murder">capital murder</a> of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a <a href="capital%20punishment%20in%20Canada">mandatory death penalty</a> if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.

On the morning of 27 June 1966, Lamb appeared without legal counsel at <a href="Essex%20County%2C%20Ontario">Essex County</a> Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was "hyperactive and agitated"; he was unable to sit still and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.

After dismissing a few more questions as "unimportant", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he "needed a lawyer". Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb "leaping from topic to topic", in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; he spoke in a casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he simply said "I don't remember." Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to laugh as he replied, "I don't remember. Somewhere." When the doctor finally asked directly about the night of the shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him.

When the interview ended at 13:35, the doctor noted that he found Lamb's hour-long maintenance of this seemingly hypomanic behaviour "remarkable". Simulation on Lamb's part was unlikely, Yaworsky believed, and lack of memory credible. The doctor wrote in his report that Lamb had been "suffering from a disease of the mind" at the time of the shootings, which had caused him to be in a kind of dream world, outside of reality. Standing before the magistrate that same afternoon, Yaworsky testified that Lamb was mentally unsound and not fit to stand trial. The magistrate once again remanded Lamb, this time to custody at <a href="Mental%20Health%20Centre%20Penetanguishene">Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre</a> for a minimum of 30 days. Lamb was again examined on 29 June 1966, this time by James Dolan, the Clinical Director of Psychiatry at <a href="St.%20Thomas%2C%20Ontario">St Thomas</a> Elgin General Hospital.

Lamb described the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He said that on 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. "Next thing I knew," he continued, "I was on the street." He told Dolan that he had seen people "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and "somehow" shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that "everything seemed unreal." He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking "what the hell am I in here for" and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.

After 30 days, on 27 July, the staff at Penetanguishene still deemed him unfit to stand trial, but by 27 August 1966 his state had improved enough for the doctors to allow his return to custody at Windsor. The doctors reported that he could now face the court—they said that the young man was now able to understand what the proceedings against him meant, and capable of working alongside a legal advisor. Because Lamb could not afford legal counsel, Justice Saul Nosanchuk was assigned by a local <a href="legal%20aid">legal aid</a> plan to advise him in the upcoming trial. Nosanchuk says that Lamb had "no hesitation" in signing a paper authorising the justice to represent him.

Nosanchuk quickly resolved that the only way to win the case and prevent the teenager from being <a href="hanging">hanged</a> was to explore the background and circumstances both of the incident and of Lamb himself with a view to a <a href="mental%20disorder%20defence">mental disorder defence</a>. At their first interview together, Nosanchuk says that Lamb was a "slightly built, almost frail, quiet and detached 18-year-old ... very boyish in appearance. He had an exceedingly polite demeanour. He was most appreciative and grateful that I had undertaken his defence." When Nosanchuk asked the boy about the events of 25 June, Lamb became hesitant, disjointed and confused in his conversation; "he seemed to view these events as if he was not really involved in them," Nosanchuk recalled. Lamb said that although he did have a faint recollection of what had happened, he could not remember taking the shotgun, loading it or shooting anybody. He said that earlier during the afternoon on 25 June he had watched a film on television in which somebody had shot and killed several people, but did not make clear whether he had been re-enacting this. The lawyer then asked Lamb to discuss his personal background, childhood and family. The 18-year-old was very reluctant to do so and when he did, Nosanchuk says that the boy seemed emotionally detached from the relatives and events he described.

Lamb appeared to the justice to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was no doubt that he had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and there was no evidence of provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed <a href="amnesia">amnesia</a> for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or <a href="psychopathy">psychopathic</a> personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the <a href="Criminal%20Code%20%28Canada%29">Criminal Code</a> and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.

However, Nosanchuk was still not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a defendant found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's <a href="Executive%20Council%20of%20Ontario">Executive Council</a>, acting on the advice of a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a>, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him for the rest of his life.

Nosanchuk then considered whether or not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.

After a brief preliminary hearing starting on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly showed no signs of emotion, the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a judge and jury under the auspices of <a href="Ontario%20Superior%20Court%20of%20Justice">Ontario's Supreme Court</a>, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb.

The prosecutor, Eugene Duchesne <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">QC</a>, began his case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh testified that three hours after the shootings his nephew had told him that he "must have done it". He said that since his nephew had come to live with him following his release from prison, he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family. However, during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant, not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner. Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings, who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and collected. When cross-examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness, they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him: one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street. Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason when she called to her husband. The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent. Hesketh told the court that when he had come home his nephew had been fast asleep in bed.

The defence began to present its psychiatric evidence on the third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed "poor <a href="wiktionary%3Abroad%23Noun">broad</a>", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having "giggled" at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then "felt fuzzy" when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".

In his cross-examination of the two doctors, Duchesne cited the psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed that it was not beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.

John Robinson, the governor of Essex County Jail, was then called by the defence. Robinson testified that during Lamb's time in the county jail, his conduct had been impeccable except for an incident five weeks before the trial, on 10 December 1966, when he had, for no apparent reason, gone on what Robinson called a "rampage". In an episode lasting three hours, the defendant had smashed over 100 windows, set fire to blankets and broken plumbing, causing cells to flood. "I was amazed by what I saw," Robinson said. "The pupils were dilated like someone who comes in heavy on narcotics—except their eyes appear sunk in and his were bulged out." George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary then told the court that Lamb lived in a fantasy dream world, which had existed in his mind since early childhood, and had been in a pre-psychotic state when released from jail on 8 June 1966. This, he said, had boiled over into an "acute <a href="Schizoid%20personality%20disorder">schizoid</a> episode" on the night of the shootings. In cross-examination, Scott was pressed as to why he had allowed Lamb's release from Kingston if this was the case; he replied that although the prison officers had been concerned about Lamb's mental state on his release, there had not been conclusive grounds to certify him insane at that time.

Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene were then called by Nosanchuk. George Darby told the court that in his conversations with Lamb the defendant had changed his story three times. He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him in an interview that he treated all people "like bugs" except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: "I hate everybody on the street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug." Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few <a href="defence%20mechanism">defence mechanism</a>s, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.

Duchesne now called on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd to counter the defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had suddenly abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane and said that he was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of <a href="Sunnybrook%20Health%20Sciences%20Centre">Sunnybrook Hospital</a> in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able to understand the nature of what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.


Nosanchuk gave his final statement to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury that every one of the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found not guilty by reason of insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened. Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing?


In response, Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a "well-reasoned argument", which the jury paid rapt attention to. Duchesne declared that the incident had been the cold, calculated murder of a defenceless group of innocent young people by an ex-convict, released only three weeks earlier and already known as an anti-social psychopath. The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors, Duchesne said, yet had convinced each one. Duchesne said that this was possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him. The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general. Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court, the prosecutor said, had testified that Lamb had understood on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them, which he asserted should be enough to incur criminal responsibility, even taking the psychiatric evidence into account. Finding Lamb not guilty by reason of insanity, he reasoned, would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts.

Justice Stark then reviewed the evidence and advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, it was up to them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be not guilty by reason of insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.

As had been made clear several times before and during the trial, Lamb's court victory did not make him a free man. He was escorted by police back to Penetanguishene and placed in the hospital's maximum security unit at Oak Ridge, where he was to remain indefinitely pending an order from the Ontario Executive Council.

Elliot Barker, the head of Oak Ridge's therapeutic division, had already interviewed Lamb in 1966 and spoken on his behalf at his trial. The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959, and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit's programmes, which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of <a href="Antipsychotic">neuroleptic</a> tranquillisation and <a href="electroconvulsive%20therapy">electroconvulsive therapy</a>, supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate. Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more of their time in each other's company, in a more natural environment; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication. "My original vision," he writes, "was that I wasn't really dealing with patients. I thought we could evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community." Barker's "Social Therapy Unit" (STU), initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence, began in September 1965, with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week, focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction. Joan Hollobon, the medical editor of the Toronto "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">Globe and Mail</a>", volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge as if she were a patient, and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates, saying that they were "pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self-government and self-therapy ... [displaying] individual responsibility, co-operation with colleagues and authority, and acceptance of rules reached by consensus."

In August 1968 the unit created a "Total Encounter Capsule", which was a windowless, soundproofed room, wide and long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat on the floor and a ceiling containing a <a href="one-way%20mirror">one-way mirror</a>. It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door. The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide "a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions." Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside. Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days. Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with <a href="Lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD-25</a>. The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature.

Following his arrival in January 1967, Lamb enthusiastically took part and thrived in Barker's new programmes, becoming, the Montreal "<a href="The%20Gazette%20%28Montreal%29">Gazette</a>" writes, "a model inmate". He became widely respected by his fellow patients and was successfully nominated as the ward's "patient therapist". "He was helpful to the other patients," Barker told the "Globe and Mail", "and they looked up to him." Barker elaborated on this subject in an interview with the "Windsor Star", telling them that during 1972 Lamb had been "one of the most respected therapists in the hospital". Lamb started a newspaper at Oak Ridge, for which he wrote articles while also encouraging others to contribute. Barker and his colleagues were so impressed by the young man's progress that they began to take him to lectures at <a href="Ontario%20Police%20College">Ontario Police College</a> in <a href="Aylmer%2C%20Ontario">Aylmer</a>, where they introduced him as evidence of rehabilitation's potential. After about five years at Oak Ridge, the matter of Lamb's liberty was taken up by a five-man Advisory Review Board made up of <a href="Ontario%20Superior%20Court%20of%20Justice">Ontario Supreme Court</a> Justice Edson Haines, two independent psychiatrists unrelated to Lamb's case, a lawyer and a lay person. The advisory board's recommendation that Lamb be released was approved by the Ontario Executive Council in early 1973; the board gave him a clean bill of health and said he was no longer dangerous.

The conditions of Lamb's release were that he must spend a year living with the Barker family on their 200-acre (0.80 sq km; 0.31 sq mi) farm, under the doctor's observation. The former inmate proved to be an industrious labourer, helping to fence the property and becoming one of the farm's best workers. Barker and his wife came to trust Lamb so closely that they allowed him to babysit their three-year-old daughter, who became very attached to the young man. During his time living and working on the farm, Lamb read a number of books on psychiatry, including "<a href="The%20Mask%20of%20Sanity">The Mask of Sanity</a>" by <a href="Hervey%20M.%20Cleckley">Hervey M. Cleckley</a>, which affected him particularly. He told the doctor that he had come to terms with his condition as a psychopath and that he wished to go overseas and do something purposeful with his life. At the same time, he considered a career in the military, which Barker supported. "He wanted that kind of life," Barker later told the "Globe and Mail". "He really seemed to need the "<a href="morale">esprit de corps</a>" of an army organisation." When Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973, starting the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a>, Lamb thought he had found his calling—using money he had saved from his labourer's salary and gifts from his grandmother, he bought <a href="State%20of%20Israel%20Bonds">State of Israel Bonds</a> and, with Barker's encouragement, travelled to Israel to volunteer for the <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a>. However, after hitch-hiking to the Israeli lines, Lamb became disillusioned by conversations he had with the soldiers there, many of whom were loath to fight and wanted to go home. He applied anyway, but was turned down because of his psychiatric history. He resolved to instead tour the world, and to that end left Israel days after arriving, intending to travel to Australia.

On his way to Australia in October 1973, Lamb stopped off in South Africa and <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> (today Zimbabwe), where he cut his travels short to enlist in the <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">Rhodesian Army</a>. According to Barker, Lamb travelled to Africa with this intention all along. Rhodesia's <a href="List%20of%20historical%20unrecognized%20states">unrecognised</a> and predominantly white government was at that time <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">fighting a war</a> against communist-backed black nationalist guerrillas who were attempting to forcibly introduce majority rule. Like most of the foreign volunteers in the Rhodesian forces, Lamb mustered into the <a href="Rhodesian%20Light%20Infantry">Rhodesian Light Infantry</a> (RLI), an all-white heliborne commando battalion engaged largely in counter-insurgency operations. He and the other foreign soldiers received the same pay and conditions of service as the Rhodesians they served alongside. "In many respects the RLI was a mirror of the <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a>, in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man's past and asked no questions," writes Chris Cocks, a veteran of the unit, "and like the Foreign Legion, once in the ranks, a man's past was irrelevant." So it proved for Lamb; keeping his past a secret, he became a highly regarded and popular member of 3 Commando, RLI, noted for his professionalism and physical fitness. "The Rhodesians thought he was a first-class soldier," Barker later told the "Globe and Mail".

Lamb visited his aunt and uncle in Windsor on leave in May 1975, "proudly wearing his uniform", journalist Tony Wanless writes. Turned out in the RLI's tartan green ceremonial dress and <a href="green%20beret">green beret</a>, he was conspicuous walking along <a href="Ouellette%20Avenue">Ouellette Avenue</a>, one of the city's main thoroughfares. Coincidentally, a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandmother along that very street at the same time, leading Edith's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement. The soldier remained oblivious, but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family. "He had the uniform and looked a little different," Richard told the "Windsor Star" a year later, "but I never forgot his face." Chaykoski's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused to leave the house alone. While staying with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time. Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada; in particular he said he "didn't want it associated with his adopted country". He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured, the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital. However, he said, he felt great loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service.

Lamb was deeply saddened by the bias he perceived the Western media to have against the Rhodesian government and army, but was reportedly conspicuous for leaping to the defence of any black Rhodesians he thought were receiving bad treatment. "He sympathised with the blacks," Barker told the "Windsor Star", "but believed that chaos would result if they took over immediately. He used to scrap with other soldiers who treated blacks badly. He was very bright and knew the blacks would eventually take over the country."

Soon after his furlough to Canada, Lamb was transferred from the RLI to the elite <a href="Rhodesian%20Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS) unit in September 1975. There he trained as a paratrooper and, after passing selection, found himself in a vastly different role to the one he had become used to during his time in the RLI. Rather than taking part in the RLI's fast and furious <a href="Fireforce">Fireforce</a> counter-strike procedures, he found himself taking part in covert reconnaissance actions, "acting as eyes and ears," as Barbara Cole writes. Wishing to see more action, Lamb requested a posting back to the RLI, which was granted; he rejoined 3 Commando. In late 1976, at the age of 28, he was promoted to <a href="Lance%20corporal">lance-corporal</a> and took command of a "stick" of four men from 12 Troop, 3 Commando on Fireforce duty on Operation "Thrasher", which covered Rhodesia's eastern highlands against guerrilla activity.

In the late afternoon of 7 November 1976, three insurgents from a group of seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of <a href="Birchenough%20Bridge">Birchenough Bridge</a> in <a href="Manicaland">Manicaland</a> province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man "stops" involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. "They are going to get me this time," he yelled, sardonically; "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" Kaye and his <a href="FN%20MAG">MAG</a> gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. "Go nail <a href="gook">gook</a>s!" Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their <a href="A%C3%A9rospatiale%20Alouette%20III">Alouette III</a> gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old <a href="national%20service">national service</a> MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an <a href="FN%20FAL">FN FAL</a> battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian <a href="Vietnam%20veteran">Vietnam veteran</a>, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.

Stop 2 landed, formed up into a sweep line and marched carefully to the north alongside a dry riverbed. As darkness fell, just as they came to a widening in the riverbed, they were suddenly fired upon by an unseen foe. All four men dropped to the ground to avoid being hit. The Canadian lance-corporal called for covering fire from Soares, which he provided as Lamb and Rok rose to their feet and cautiously moved forward. A dark figure suddenly ran across the soldiers' line of sight, between Lamb and the riverbed, and from a distance of about 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a frenzied, imprecise burst of fire. Mortally wounded by two errant shots through the chest, Lamb stumbled, slumped to the ground and lay face-down in a heap. One of the bullets exited through the back of his body, smashing the radio he had been carrying. He died almost instantly. Meanwhile, the <a href="Professional%20revolutionaries">cadres</a> ahead ran headlong into Stop 1, led by Sergeant Derrick Taylor, and were all killed in the ensuing fire fight. Taylor's stick sustained no casualties. When the battle was over, Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier, Rok and Soares and waited beside Lamb's lifeless body all night until it could be evacuated by helicopter to the local hospital at <a href="Chipinge%20District">Chipinga</a>. The death was officially recorded as "<a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a>", with no reference to <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>.

As Lamb had predicted, his death provoked stories in the Canadian local and national media that strongly stressed his history of violence and insanity. It even caused a heated debate in the Canadian <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons</a> over why, considering his personal history in Ontario and subsequent service in the armed forces of a country Canada did not recognise, Lamb had been issued a valid <a href="Canadian%20passport">Canadian passport</a> and allowed to renew it on 26 April 1976. The Chaykoski family received the news with some relief, Wanless reported in the "Windsor Star", having "lived in terror" since Lamb's release from Penetanguishene three years earlier.

In Rhodesia, by contrast, Lamb was posthumously held in very high regard by the men who had served alongside him. His photograph in full dress uniform was placed on 3 Commando's Wall of Honour and remained there until the RLI was disbanded in 1980. When the story of his earlier life in Canada was run by the "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Zimbabwe%29">Rhodesia Herald</a>", the paper received numerous strongly worded letters from soldiers who refused to believe it. They demanded a printed retraction and apology, which the "Herald" gave soon after to preempt any further scandal. The lance-corporal was given what the "Windsor Star" and "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" both described as a "hero's funeral" in the Rhodesian capital, <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, on 15 November 1976. No members of his family were present. His coffin, draped in <a href="Flag%20of%20Rhodesia">the Rhodesian flag</a> and topped with a large bouquet of flowers, was carried on a <a href="Limbers%20and%20caissons">gun carriage</a> to Warren Hills Cemetery, on the western outskirts of the city, where soldiers of the RLI fired three volleys of shots and senior officers saluted as the coffin was carried to the crematorium on the shoulders of eight RLI men. Lamb's ashes were afterwards returned to his relatives in Windsor, Ontario, where they were buried alongside the remains of his grandmother.

It was released for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> worldwide on June 14, 2013. Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, <a href="Ellie%20%28The%20Last%20of%20Us%29">Ellie</a>, across a <a href="Apocalyptic%20and%20post-apocalyptic%20fiction">post-apocalyptic</a> United States. "The Last of Us" is played from a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Third-person%20view">third-person perspective</a>. Players use firearms and <a href="improvised%20weapons">improvised weapons</a>, and can use <a href="Stealth%20game">stealth</a> to defend against hostile humans and <a href="cannibalism">cannibalistic</a> creatures infected by a mutated strain of the "<a href="Cordyceps">Cordyceps</a>" fungus. In the <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">online multiplayer</a> mode, up to eight players engage in <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative</a> and competitive gameplay.

<a href="Development%20of%20The%20Last%20of%20Us">Development of "The Last of Us"</a> began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, "". The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the central focus of the game, with all other elements developed around it. Actors <a href="Troy%20Baker">Troy Baker</a> and <a href="Ashley%20Johnson">Ashley Johnson</a> portrayed Joel and Ellie respectively through <a href="Voice%20acting">voice</a> and <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a>, and assisted creative director <a href="Neil%20Druckmann">Neil Druckmann</a> with the development of the characters and story. The <a href="Music%20of%20The%20Last%20of%20Us">original score</a> was composed and performed by <a href="Gustavo%20Santaolalla">Gustavo Santaolalla</a>.

Following its announcement in December 2011, "The Last of Us" was widely anticipated. Upon release, it received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its narrative, gameplay, visual and sound design, <a href="characterization">characterization</a>, and depiction of female characters. "The Last of Us" became one of the best-selling games on the PlayStation 3, as well as one of the <a href="list%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games">best-selling video games of all time</a>. Selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April 2018, it <a href="List%20of%20accolades%20received%20by%20The%20Last%20of%20Us">won year-end accolades</a>, including multiple <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> awards from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies, making it one of the most awarded games in history, and is considered one of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">greatest video games ever made</a>.

After the game's release, Naughty Dog released several <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> additions. "" adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend Riley. An enhanced edition of the original game, "<a href="The%20Last%20of%20Us%20Remastered">The Last of Us Remastered</a>", was released for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> in July 2014. A sequel, "<a href="The%20Last%20of%20Us%20Part%20II">The Last of Us Part II</a>", was announced in December 2016.

"The Last of Us" is an <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="survival%20horror">survival horror</a> game played from a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Third-person%20view">third-person perspective</a>. The player traverses across <a href="Apocalyptic%20and%20post-apocalyptic%20fiction">post-apocalyptic</a> environments such as towns, buildings, forest and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, <a href="improvised%20weapons">improvised weapons</a>, and <a href="Stealth%20game">stealth</a> to defend against hostile humans and <a href="Zombie%20%28fiction%29">cannibalistic</a> creatures infected by a mutated strain of the "<a href="Cordyceps">Cordyceps</a>" fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, <a href="Ellie%20%28The%20Last%20of%20Us%29">Ellie</a>, across the United States; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a>. The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment.

In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits and <a href="Molotov%20cocktail">Molotov cocktail</a>s can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health meter</a> and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged through the use of health kits.

Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. "Listen Mode" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the dynamic <a href="cover%20system">cover system</a>, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a <a href="Positional%20advantage">tactical advantage</a> during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.

The game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.

The <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">online multiplayer</a> allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team <a href="deathmatch">deathmatch</a>es, with the latter excluding the ability to <a href="Spawning%20%28video%20gaming%29">respawn</a>; Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's <a href="Lock%20box">lockbox</a>, and the first to capture such lockbox wins. In every mode, players select a faction—Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)—and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve "weeks", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction. Killing enemies, reviving allies, and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies; parts can also be scavenged from enemies' bodies. Players are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan's supplies grow. Players can connect the game to their <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> account, which alters clan members' names and faces to match the players' <a href="Facebook%20features%23Friend">Facebook friends</a>. Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats, helmets, masks, and emblems.

In September 2013, an outbreak of a mutant "Cordyceps" fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the Infected. In the suburbs of <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, Joel (<a href="Troy%20Baker">Troy Baker</a>) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy (<a href="Jeffrey%20Pierce">Jeffrey Pierce</a>) and daughter Sarah (<a href="Hana%20Hayes">Hana Hayes</a>). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms. Twenty years later, civilization has been destroyed by the infection. Survivors live in heavily policed quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess (<a href="Annie%20Wersching">Annie Wersching</a>) in the quarantine zone in the <a href="North%20End%2C%20Boston">North End</a> of <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. They hunt down Robert (<a href="Robin%20Atkin%20Downes">Robin Atkin Downes</a>), a <a href="black%20market">black-market</a> dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities.

The leader of the Fireflies, Marlene (<a href="Merle%20Dandridge">Merle Dandridge</a>), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, <a href="Ellie%20%28The%20Last%20of%20Us%29">Ellie</a> (<a href="Ashley%20Johnson">Ashley Johnson</a>), to Fireflies hiding in the <a href="Massachusetts%20State%20House">Massachusetts State House</a> outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks ago and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected and, believing in Ellie's importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (<a href="W.%20Earl%20Brown">W. Earl Brown</a>), a smuggler who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle. Driving into <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (<a href="Nadji%20Jeter">Nadji Jeter</a>). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten by an infected but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and commits suicide out of grief.

In the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in <a href="Jackson%2C%20Wyoming">Jackson, Wyoming</a>, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife Maria (<a href="Ashley%20Scott">Ashley Scott</a>). Joel decides to leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he decides to let her stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned, but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City, Utah</a>. Afterward, the two are attacked by bandits and Joel is severely wounded while escaping.

During the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David (<a href="Nolan%20North">Nolan North</a>) and James (<a href="Reuben%20Langdon">Reuben Langdon</a>), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food; despite initially appearing friendly and cooperative, David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is eventually captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing the offer, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches Ellie as she kills David and breaks down crying; Joel comforts her before they flee.

In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning, before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hope of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On the drive out of the city, Joel claims that the Fireflies had found many other immune people but were unable to create a cure, and that they have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's settlement, Ellie reveals that and expresses her <a href="survivor%20guilt">survivor guilt</a>. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true.

<a href="Naughty%20Dog">Naughty Dog</a> began <a href="Development%20of%20The%20Last%20of%20Us">developing "The Last of Us"</a> in 2009, following the release of "". For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed "" (2011), the other began work on "The Last of Us". Director <a href="Bruce%20Straley">Bruce Straley</a> and creative director <a href="Neil%20Druckmann">Neil Druckmann</a> led the team responsible for developing "The Last of Us".

Druckmann views "The Last of Us" as a coming of age story, in which Ellie adapts to survival after spending time with Joel, as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child. A major motif of the game is that "life goes on"; this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to "reignite [Ellie's] lust for life", after her suffering following her encounter with David. The Infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> nature documentary "<a href="Planet%20Earth%20%282006%20TV%20series%29">Planet Earth</a>" (2006), which featured the "Cordyceps" fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection.

The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the central focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided <a href="Voice%20acting">voice</a> and <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> performances. Baker and Johnson contributed to the development of the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Ellie's physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to make her look more similar to Johnson. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist of "The Last of Us", but the team found it difficult to believe her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script, but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality.

"The Last of Us" features an <a href="Music%20of%20The%20Last%20of%20Us">original score</a> composed primarily by <a href="Gustavo%20Santaolalla">Gustavo Santaolalla</a>, along with compositions by Andrew Buresh, Anthony Caruso, and Jonathan Mayer. Known for his minimalist compositions, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. He used various instruments to compose the score, including some that he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. This minimalist approach was also taken with the game's sound and art design. The sound of the Infected was one of the first tasks during development; the team experimented with the sound in order to achieve the best work possible. To achieve the sound of the Clicker, they hired voice actress <a href="Misty%20Lee">Misty Lee</a>, who provided a sound that audio lead Phillip Kovats described as originating in the "back of the throat". The art department took various pieces of work as inspiration, such as <a href="Robert%20Polidori">Robert Polidori</a>'s photographs following <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, which were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh. The art department were forced to negotiate for things that they wished to include, due to the strong differing opinions of the team during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The game's opening credits were produced by Sony's <a href="SCE%20San%20Diego%20Studio">San Diego Studio</a>.

The team created new <a href="Game%20engine">engines</a> to satisfy their needs for the game. The artificial intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was a major contributor to the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate <a href="soft%20light">soft light</a>, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's <a href="user%20interface%20design">user interface design</a> also underwent various iterations throughout development.

"The Last of Us" was announced on December 10, 2011, at the <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, alongside its debut trailer and an official press release acknowledging some of the game's features. The announcement ignited widespread anticipation within the gaming industry, which journalists owed to Naughty Dog's reputation. The game missed its original projected release date of May 7, 2013, and was pushed to June 14, 2013 worldwide for further polishing. To promote <a href="pre-order">pre-order</a> sales, Naughty Dog collaborated with several retailers to provide <a href="special%20edition">special edition</a>s of the game with extra content.

<a href="Downloadable%20content">Downloadable content</a> (DLC) for the game was released following its launch. The game's <a href="Season%20pass%20%28video%20gaming%29">Season Pass</a> includes access to all DLC, as well as some additional abilities, and the documentary "Grounded: Making The Last of Us"; the documentary was released online in February 2014. Two DLC packs were included with some of the game's special editions and were available upon release. The "Sights and Sounds Pack" included the soundtrack, a dynamic theme for the PlayStation 3 <a href="XrossMediaBar">home screen</a>, and two <a href="Avatar%20%28computing%29">avatars</a>. The "Survival Pack" featured bonus skins for the player following the completion of the campaign, and in-game money, as well as bonus experience points and early access to customizable items for the game's multiplayer. "Abandoned Territories Map Pack", released on October 15, 2013, added four new multiplayer maps, based on locations in the game's story. "Nightmare Bundle", released on November 5, 2013, added a collection of ten head items, nine of which are available to purchase separately.

"" adds a single-player campaign which serves as a prequel to the main storyline, featuring Ellie and her friend Riley. It was released on February 14, 2014 as DLC and on May 12, 2015 as a <a href="Stand-alone%20expansion%20pack">standalone expansion pack</a>. A third bundle was released on May 6, 2014, featuring five separate DLC: "Grounded" added a new difficulty to the main game and "Left Behind"; "Reclaimed Territories Map Pack" added new multiplayer maps; "Professional Survival Skills Bundle" and "Situational Survival Skills Bundle" added eight new multiplayer skills; and "Survivalist Weapon Bundle" added four new weapons. The "Grit and Gear Bundle", which added new headgear items, masks and gestures, was released on August 5, 2014. A "Game of the Year Edition" containing all downloadable content was released in Europe on November 11, 2014.

On April 9, 2014, Sony announced "<a href="The%20Last%20of%20Us%20Remastered">The Last of Us Remastered</a>", an enhanced version of the game for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>. It was released on July 29, 2014 in North America. "Remastered" features improved graphics and rendering upgrades, including increased <a href="draw%20distance">draw distance</a>, an upgraded combat mechanic, and higher <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a>. Other enhancements include advanced audio options, an <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a>, and a Photo Mode. It includes the previously released downloadable content, including "Left Behind" and some multiplayer maps. The development team aimed to create a "true" remaster, maintaining the "core experience" and major story and gameplay elements.

"The Last of Us" received critical acclaim. <a href="Review%20aggregator">Review aggregator</a> website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> calculated an <a href="Normalization%20%28statistics%29">average</a> score of 95 out of 100, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 98 reviews. It is the fifth-highest rated PlayStation 3 game on Metacritic. Reviewers praised the character development, story and <a href="subtext">subtext</a>, visual and sound design, and depiction of female and <a href="LGBT%20themes%20in%20video%20games">LGBT</a> characters. The game is considered one of the most significant titles of the <a href="Seventh%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">seventh generation</a> of video games, and has been included among the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">greatest video games of all time</a>. Colin Moriarty of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> called "The Last of Us" "a masterpiece" and "PlayStation 3's best exclusive", and "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" considered it "the most riveting, emotionally resonant story-driven epic" of the console generation. Oli Welsh of "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" wrote that it is "a beacon of hope" for the survival horror genre; Andy Kelly of "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" declared it "Naughty Dog's finest moment".

Kelly of "Computer and Video Games" found the story memorable, and IGN's Moriarty named it one of the game's standout features. "<a href="PlayStation%20Official%20Magazine%20-%20UK">PlayStation Official Magazine</a>"s David Meikleham wrote that the pacing contributed to the improvement of the story, stating that there is "a real sense of time elapsed and journey traveled along every step of the way", and <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a>'s Jim Sterling lauded the game's suspenseful moments. Richard Mitchell of <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> found that the narrative improved the character relationships.

The characters—particularly the relationship between Joel and Ellie—received acclaim. Matt Helgeson of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" wrote that the relationship felt identifiable, naming it "poignant" and "well-drawn". "Eurogamer"s Welsh wrote that the characters were developed with "real patience and skill", appreciating their emotional value, and Joystiq's Mitchell found the relationship "genuine" and emotional. "PlayStation Official Magazine"s Meikleham named Joel and Ellie the best characters of any PlayStation 3 game, while IGN's Moriarty identified it as a highlight of the game. Kelly of "Computer and Video Games" named the characters "richly painted", feeling invested in their stories. Philip Kollar of "<a href="Polygon%20%28website%29">Polygon</a>" felt that Ellie was believable, making it easier to develop a connection to her, and that the relationship between the characters was assisted by the game's optional conversations. The character performances also received praise, with "Edge" and "Eurogamer"s Welsh noting that the script improved as a result.

Many reviewers found the game's combat a refreshing difference from other games. "Game Informer"s Helgeson appreciated the vulnerability during fights, while Kelly of "Computer and Video Games" enjoyed the variety in approaching the combat. IGN's Moriarty felt that the crafting system assisted the combat, and that the latter contributed to the narrative's emotional value, adding that enemies feel "human". Joystiq's Mitchell reiterated similar comments, stating that the combat "piles death upon death on Joel's hands". Welsh of "Eurogamer" found the suspenseful and threatening encounters added positively to the gameplay. Tom Mc Shea of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> wrote that the artificial intelligence negatively affected the combat, with enemies often ignoring players' companions. "Polygon"s Kollar felt that the combat was unfair, especially when fighting the Infected.

The game's visual features were commended by many reviewers. The <a href="Game%20art%20design">art design</a> was lauded as "outstanding" by "Computer and Video Games" Kelly, and "jaw-dropping" by "Eurogamer"s Welsh. In contrast, Mc Shea of GameSpot identified the visual representation of the post-apocalyptic world was "mundane", having been portrayed various times previously. The game's <a href="Video%20game%20graphics">graphics</a> have been frequently named by critics as the best for a PlayStation 3 game, with Helgeson of "Game Informer" naming them "unmatched in console gaming" and Moriarty of IGN stating that they contribute to the realism. Destructoid's Sterling wrote that game was visually impressive but that technical issues, such as some "muddy and basic" textures found early in the game, left a negative impact on the visuals.

The world and environments of the game drew acclaim from many reviewers. Kelly of "Computer and Video Games" stated that the environments are "large, detailed, and littered with secrets", adding that "The Last of Us" "masks" its <a href="Linear%20gameplay">linearity</a> successfully. "Edge" repeated similar remarks, writing that the level design serves the story appropriately. Helgeson of "Game Informer" wrote that the world "effectively and gorgeously [conveys] the loneliness" of the story. IGN's Moriarty appreciated the added design elements placed around the game world, such as the hidden notes and letters.

Reviewers praised the use of sound in "The Last of Us". "Eurogamer"s Welsh felt that the sound design was significantly better than in other games, while "Game Informer"s Helgeson dubbed it "amazing". Mc Shea of GameSpot stated that the audio added to the effect of the gameplay, particularly when hiding from enemies. Kelly of "Computer and Video Games" found that the environmental audio positively impacted gameplay, and that Gustavo Santaolalla's score was "sparse and delicate". Both "Game Informer"s Helgeson and Destructoid's Sterling called the score "haunting", with the latter finding that it complements the gameplay.

The graphic depiction of violence in "The Last of Us" generated substantial commentary from critics. <a href="Engadget">Engadget</a> writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was "a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety", as opposed to being used as a method to achieve objectives. "<a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>"s Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was "heavy, consequential and necessary", as opposed to gratuitous. <a href="USGamer">USGamer</a>'s Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of "Computer and Video Games" stated that, despite the "incredibly brutal" combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. "Eurogamer"s Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the violence is not "desensitized or mindless". Matt Helgeson of "Game Informer" observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiq's Mitchell wrote that the violence is "designed to be uncomfortable", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game.

Many critics discussed the game's depiction of female characters. Jason Killingsworth of "Edge" praised its lack of sexualized female characters, writing that it "offers a refreshing antidote to the sexism and regressive gender attitudes of most blockbuster videogames". "Eurogamer"s Ellie Gibson praised Ellie as "sometimes strong, sometimes vulnerable, but never a cliché". She felt that Ellie is initially established as a "damsel in distress", but that this concept is subverted. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit praised the female characters as morally conflicted and sympathetic, but wrote that gender in video games should be evaluated "based on their actual merits, not in relation to other games". Chris Suellentrop of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" acknowledged that Ellie was a likable and "sometimes powerful" character, but argued that "The Last of Us" is "actually the story of Joel", stating that it's "another video game by men, for men and about men". "The Last of Us" was also praised for its depiction of LGBT characters. Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality "added to his character ... without really <a href="Tokenism">tokenizing</a> him". American organization <a href="GLAAD">GLAAD</a> named Bill one of the "most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013", calling him "deeply flawed but wholly unique". A kiss between two female characters in "Left Behind" was met with positive reactions.

Within seven days of its release, "The Last of Us" sold over 1.3 million units, becoming the biggest video game launch of 2013 at the time. Three weeks after its release, the game sold over 3.4 million units, and was deemed the biggest launch of an original game since 2011's "<a href="L.A.%20Noire">L.A. Noire</a>" and the fastest-selling PlayStation 3 game of 2013 at the time. The game became the best-selling digital release on <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a> for PlayStation 3, though numerical sales figures were not disclosed; this record was later beaten by "<a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V">Grand Theft Auto V</a>". "The Last of Us" ultimately became the tenth best-selling game of 2013. By August 2014, the game had sold eight million copies: seven million on PlayStation 3 and one million on PlayStation 4. By April 2018, the game sold 17 million copies across both consoles. It is the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20PlayStation%203%20video%20games">third best-selling PlayStation 3 game of all time</a>. In the United Kingdom, the game remained atop the charts for six consecutive weeks, matching records set by multi-platform titles. Within 48 hours of its release, "The Last of Us" generated more than the £3 million earned by "<a href="Man%20of%20Steel%20%28film%29">Man of Steel</a>" in the same period. The game also topped the charts in the United States, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Spain, and Japan.

"The Last of Us" is one of the most awarded games of all time, winning over 240 <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> awards. Prior to its release, it received numerous awards for its previews at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a>.

Malkin Tower

Malkin Tower (or the Malking Tower or Mocking Tower) was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the <a href="Pendle%20witches">Lancashire witch trials</a> of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' <a href="coven">coven</a> in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the <a href="Forest%20of%20Pendle">Forest of Pendle</a>. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word "Malkin". Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name "Malkin" has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman; the similar "mawkin" was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut. "Malkin" was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in <a href="grimalkin">grimalkin</a> or grey malkin, and was an old northern English name for a <a href="hare">hare</a>, into which witches were said to be able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of "mal" and "kin" as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower, which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time. Another possibility is a corruption of <a href="malt%20house">malt kiln</a>, which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the "Tower" appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a <a href="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="peel%20tower">peel tower</a>, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and "tower" may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower, or Mocking Tower.

On <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a>, 10 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history. The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the alleged Pendle witches.

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a <a href="peddler">pedlar</a> from <a href="Halifax%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Halifax</a>, who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible. She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft. Both were arrested and detained in <a href="Lancaster%20Castle%23Gaol">Lancaster Gaol</a>, along with two other women. Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up <a href="Lancaster%20Castle">Lancaster Castle</a>. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's "mentally sub-normal" brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches. Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a> <a href="Assizes">Assizes</a> and one at York.

The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain. It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials. The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the "melancholy associations" of the place. The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his "<a href="The%20Wonderfull%20Discoverie%20of%20Witches%20in%20the%20Countie%20of%20Lancaster">The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster</a>" mentions "Malking Tower" many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former <a href="royal%20forest">royal forest</a> that covered a considerable area south and east of <a href="Pendle%20Hill">Pendle Hill</a>, extending almost to the towns of <a href="Burnley">Burnley</a>, <a href="Colne">Colne</a> and <a href="Padiham">Padiham</a>.
One contender is in the civil parish of <a href="Blacko">Blacko</a>, on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm; since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building. In "The Lancashire Witch-Craze", Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and <a href="Gisburn">Gisburn</a>. Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn <a href="public%20house">public house</a>; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign. The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole. It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century <a href="manorial%20court">halmote court</a> records for the <a href="manor">manor</a> of Colne as Mawkin Yarde, described as being "in the north of Colne", but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

In 1891 local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill. Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of <a href="Newchurch%20in%20Pendle">Newchurch in Pendle</a>. Douglas claims there is "persuasive" evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, <a href="Barley%2C%20Lancashire">Barley</a> and <a href="Roughlee">Roughlee</a>. Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found. A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to <a href="Black%20Moss%20Reservoirs">Lower Black Moss reservoir</a> near Barley.

Sweet Nothing in My Ear (play)

Sweet Nothing in my Ear is a <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">play</a> in two acts for 4 men, 5 women, and 1 boy. "This is not a "<a href="Deafness">deaf</a>" play. It's a play with deaf and hearing characters. In performance, it must be accessible to both a deaf and hearing audience at the same time. It requires a seamless blend of <a href="American%20Sign%20Language">American Sign Language</a> and <a href="spoken%20English">spoken English</a>. The two happen simultaneously through the performance of the play. The role of Dan requires a hearing actor who signs well. As a hearing man in a deaf family, he is called upon to interpret speech into <a href="sign%20language">sign language</a>, "voice" ASL into speech, or switch his voice off completely and purely sign. Whenever Dan is alone with any member of his deaf family, he would only sign and not use his voice (unless indicated). All the deaf characters of the play - Laura, Max, Sally, Adam, Dr. Walters - use only American Sign Language. They are simultaneously "voiced" or "<a href="Voice%20acting">voice acted</a>" from the side of the stage by a member of the company. When Dan switches off his voice and purely signs, he is simultaneously "voiced" by a company member. The company must be four hearing actors who sign. They sit on the periphery of the stage, never leaving, throughout the play. They perform three functions: to "voice" the actors who sign, to sign the actors who speak and to step forward as the supporting players. Deaf audience member experience this play signed entirely in their language. Hearing audience members - most who know nothing about sign language - have the experience of watching the play in sign language while hearing it acted at the same time. Two languages become one." - Stephen Sachs

After the <a href="Drafting%20%28aerodynamics%29%23Bump%20drafting">two-car style draft</a> (also called tandem racing) dominated races held on <a href="restrictor%20plate">restrictor plate</a> tracks during 2011, NASCAR reduced the size of the <a href="Radiator%20%28engine%20cooling%29">radiators</a> from five liters to two liters and the air intakes were moved towards the car's <a href="Fascia%20%28car%29">fascia</a> section. The size of the restrictor plate was reduced by and the cars were required to run with softer springs and a smaller rear spoiler. These changes were intended to reduce the effectiveness of two-car style drafting and to make the cars more challenging to turn. <a href="Sprint%20Cup%20Series">Sprint Cup Series</a> director <a href="John%20Darby%20%28NASCAR%20official%29">John Darby</a> stated NASCAR wanted to be able to allow teams more options with drafting and hoped the difference in speeds between tandem drafting and pack style racing would be reduced.

Two practice sessions were held on Friday afternoon. The first session lasted 45 minutes; the second, scheduled for 60 minutes, was shortened to ten because of rain. <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a> had the fastest time (44.607 seconds, five-thousandths of a second faster than <a href="Jeff%20Burton">Jeff Burton</a>) in the first session (where drivers tried out pack and tandem drafting). <a href="David%20Ragan">David Ragan</a> (with a time of 44.966 seconds) was third, ahead of <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29">Ryan Newman</a>, and <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a>. <a href="Brad%20Keselowski">Brad Keselowski</a> was seventh, within one second of Kenseth's time. <a href="Tony%20Stewart">Tony Stewart</a> and Kurt Busch collided near the end of the session, beginning a chain-reaction accident involving cars driven by <a href="A.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJ.%20Allmendinger">A. J. Allmendinger</a>, Keselowski and Kyle Busch; Keselowski, Allmendinger, and Kyle and Kurt Busch were required to use their backup cars. Stewart was taken to the track's infield care center where he was treated for minor injuries and later released. McMurray was fastest in the second practice session, (where twelve drivers took part) with a time of 45.524 seconds. <a href="Juan%20Pablo%20Montoya">Juan Pablo Montoya</a> was second, ahead of <a href="Greg%20Biffle">Greg Biffle</a> and <a href="Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</a>. <a href="Marcos%20Ambrose">Marcos Ambrose</a> was fifth fastest, with a time of 46.037 seconds. Hamlin, <a href="Michael%20Waltrip">Michael Waltrip</a>, <a href="Joey%20Logano">Joey Logano</a>, Kenseth, and <a href="Carl%20Edwards">Carl Edwards</a> rounded out the top ten positions.

The 25 drivers determined their starting positions by lot, a feature that is unique to the event. <a href="Martin%20Truex%2C%20Jr.">Martin Truex, Jr.</a> drew the <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, with <a href="Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</a>, Keselowski, McMurray and Ragan rounding out the first five positions. Kurt Busch drew sixth place and Biffle drew seventh, ahead of <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt, Jr.</a> and Allmendinger in eighth and ninth. Logano, Edwards, Burton, Newman, and <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a> drew the next five positions. <a href="Tony%20Stewart">Tony Stewart</a>, who drew fifteenth, was followed by Hamlin, <a href="Clint%20Bowyer">Clint Bowyer</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a>, Kahne, and Waltrip for the first 20 spots. Ambrose, <a href="Kevin%20Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a>, Kenseth, <a href="Paul%20Menard">Paul Menard</a>, and Montoya drew the last five positions in the race. Once the lot was completed, Truex commented, "I haven't been in this race in a few years. I absolutely hated being down here (those years) and watching this race, so it's cool just to be in it and to get the pole is icing on the cake."

The 2012 Budweiser Shootout was the first <a href="Exhibition%20game%23Auto%20racing">exhibition race</a> of the season, and was televised live in the United States by <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>, which began at 8:10 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a>. Tim McNeil of First Methodist Church began the pre-race ceremonies with an <a href="invocation">invocation</a>. Country music group <a href="Little%20Big%20Town">Little Big Town</a> performed the <a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a>, and Petty 1st Class Officer William Kimberl, Petty 1st Class Officer Andres Reyes and Petty Officer 2nd Class Aaron Schwartz from the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States Armed Forces</a> commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the <a href="Parade%20lap">pace laps</a>, Keselowski, Allmendinger, and Kyle and Kurt Busch had to move to the rear of the grid because they had switched to their backup cars.

McMurray accelerated faster than Truex off the line (leading him at the first turn), but by the end of the first lap Earnhardt had the lead. Three laps later, McMurray reclaimed the lead; one lap later, Logano passed him. On lap six, Truex briefly reclaimed the lead before Harvick passed him. Three laps later a <a href="The%20Big%20One%20%28NASCAR%29">multiple-car collision</a> between turns one and two, involving Waltrip, Menard, Martin, Ragan, Kenseth, and Montoya, triggered the first caution of the race and the <a href="Safety%20car">pace car</a>. The race restarted on lap sixteen, with Earnhardt leading Harvick and Truex. On the seventeenth lap, McMurray passed Harvick on the backstraightaway to move into the lead. One lap later, Truex took the lead for a lap before he was passed by Kurt Busch. On the 21st lap, McMurray moved back into second place; two laps later McMurray passed Truex to reclaim the lead, with Edwards moving into second.

On lap 25, Gordon passed Edwards between the third and fourth turns to move into second place and a second caution was issued shortly afterward. After the caution, all the teams made a ten-minute pit stop before the restart. McMurray led Gordon, Edwards, Johnson, and Biffle in the first lap of the <a href="rolling%20start">rolling start</a> before Gordon took the lead; one lap later, Edwards passed Kyle Busch to move into second place. On lap 28, Biffle, assisted by teammate Edwards, passed Gordon to take the lead. Bowyer experienced <a href="Understeer%20and%20oversteer">oversteer</a> on lap 29, but regained control of his car. Two laps later, Bowyer spun sideways after he was hit by teammate Truex leaving the tri-oval; a third caution was issued, during which most of the leaders, including Biffle, made pit stops for fuel and tires. Earnhardt led the field back up to speed at the restart. McMurray reclaimed the lead on lap 38; Earnhardt tried to pass underneath McMurray going into the third turn two laps later, but McMurray kept the position. Truex passed McMurray on lap 44, with help from Earnhardt. By the 47th lap, Harvick had moved into the lead position; Kyle Busch collided with the <a href="SAFER%20barrier">wall</a>, escaping with minor damage to the front of his car. He passed McMurray to reclaim the lead one lap later, with Gordon taking over first place by the start of lap 50. One lap later McMurray, aided by teammate Harvick, regained the lead.

The fourth caution was issued on lap 54 when Ambrose made contact with Logano, causing a multiple-car collision involving Earnhardt, Kenseth, and Truex. Most of the leaders made pit stops during the caution. During lap 55 Harvick and Logano drove to their garages, retiring from the race. Biffle led at the lap 61 restart before Gordon reclaimed the lead, with Johnson moving into second place. Ten laps later, Kyle Busch took the lead until Stewart passed him two laps later. On lap 74, Kyle Busch lost control of his car which caused Gordon to hit the wall; his car rolled over, prompting the fifth and final caution. Kurt Busch, Johnson and McMurray were caught up in the wreck. The race restarted on lap 81, for a <a href="green%E2%80%93white%E2%80%93checker%20finish">green–white–checker finish</a> (extending the race to 82 laps) with Stewart leading Ambrose, Bowyer and Keselowski until Ambrose (with assistance from Keselowski) passed him. On the final lap, Stewart reclaimed the lead (with help from Kyle Busch) before Busch passed him to win the race. The margin of victory was 0.013 seconds, the closest in the history of the event. Ambrose finished third, Keselowski fourth and Hamlin fifth. Biffle, Newman, Bowyer, Edwards and Montoya rounded out the top ten finishers in the race.

Kyle Busch appeared in <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23V">Victory Lane</a> to celebrate his first victory of the season; the win earned him $198,550. He said, "I don't know how many times I spun out and didn't spin out. Amazing race. It was fun to drive when I wasn't getting turned around", and, "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear ... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." Stewart, who finished second, said, "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers."

According to Ragan, who was involved in the race's largest accident, "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's going to take a lot more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the <a href="2012%20Daytona%20500">Daytona 500</a> and believed it would be "chaotic" and "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from to after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46 million viewers.

Natchez revolt

The Natchez revolt, or the Natchez Massacre, was an attack by the <a href="Natchez%20people">Natchez people</a> on <a href="French%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">French colonists</a> near present-day <a href="Natchez%2C%20Mississippi">Natchez, Mississippi</a>, on November 29, 1729. The Natchez and French had lived alongside each other in the <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">Louisiana colony</a> for more than a decade prior to the incident, mostly conducting peaceful trade and occasionally intermarrying. After a period of deteriorating relations, however, Natchez leaders were provoked to revolt when the French colonial commandant, Sieur de Chépart, demanded land from a Natchez village for his own plantation near <a href="Fort%20Rosalie">Fort Rosalie</a>. They plotted their attack over several days and managed to conceal their plans from most of the French; those who overheard and warned Chépart of an attack were considered untruthful and were punished. In a coordinated attack on the fort and the homesteads, the Natchez killed almost all of the Frenchmen, while sparing most of the women and African slaves. Approximately 230 colonists were killed overall, and the fort and homes were burned to the ground.

When the French in <a href="New%20Orleans%23Beginnings%20through%20the%2019th%20century">New Orleans</a>, the colonial capital, heard the news of the <a href="massacre">massacre</a>, they feared a general Indian uprising and were concerned that the Natchez might have conspired with other tribes. They first responded by ordering a massacre of the <a href="Chaouacha">Chaouacha</a> people, who had no relation to the Natchez revolt, wiping out their entire village. The French and their <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a> allies then retaliated against the Natchez villages, capturing hundreds of Natchez and selling them into slavery, although many managed to escape to the north and take refuge among the <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw people</a>. The Natchez waged low-intensity warfare against the French over the following years, but retaliatory expeditions against Natchez refugees among the Chickasaw in 1730 and 1731 forced them to move on and live as refugees among the <a href="Muscogee">Creek</a> and <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> tribes. By 1736 the Natchez had ceased to exist as an independent people.

The attack on Fort Rosalie destroyed some of the Louisiana colony's most productive farms and endangered shipments of food and trade goods on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. As a result, the <a href="Early%20modern%20France%23France%20in%20the%2017th%20and%2018th%20centuries">French state</a> returned control of Louisiana from the <a href="French%20West%20India%20Company">French West India Company</a> to the crown in 1731, as the company had been having trouble running the colony. Louisiana governor <a href="%C3%89tienne%20P%C3%A9rier%20%28governor%29">Étienne Périer</a> was held responsible for the massacre and its aftermath, and he was recalled to France in 1732.

While descending the Mississippi River in 1682, <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Robert%20Cavelier%2C%20Sieur%20de%20La%20Salle">Robert de La Salle</a> became the first Frenchman to encounter the Natchez and declared them an ally. The Natchez were sedentary and lived in nine semi-autonomous villages; the French considered them the most civilized tribe of the region. By 1700 the Natchez' numbers had been reduced to about 3,500 by the <a href="Demographic%20history%20of%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas%23Depopulation%20from%20disease">diseases that ravaged indigenous populations</a> in the wake of contact with Europeans, and by 1720 further epidemics had halved that population. Their society was strictly divided into a noble class called "the Suns" (<a href="Natchez%20language">Natchez</a>: ') and a commoner class called in French "the Stinkards" (Natchez: '). Between 1699 and 1702, the Natchez received the explorer <a href="Pierre%20Le%20Moyne%20d%27Iberville">Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville</a> in peace and allowed a French missionary to settle among them. At this time, the Natchez were at war with the Chickasaw people, who had received guns from their English allies, and the Natchez expected to benefit similarly from their relation with the French. Nonetheless, the British presence in the territory led the Natchez to split into pro-British and pro-French factions. The central village, called Natchez or the <a href="Grand%20Village%20of%20the%20Natchez">Grand Village</a>, was led by the <a href="paramount%20chief">paramount chief</a> Great Sun (Natchez: "") and the war chief <a href="Tattooed%20Serpent">Tattooed Serpent</a> ("Serpent Piqué" in the French sources, Natchez "obalalkabiche"), both of whom were interested in pursuing an alliance with the French.

The first conflict between the French and the Natchez took place in 1716, when the <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Louisiana">Governor of Louisiana</a>, <a href="Antoine%20Laumet%20de%20La%20Mothe%2C%20sieur%20de%20Cadillac">Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac</a>, passed through Natchez territory and neglected to renew the alliance with the Natchez by smoking the <a href="Calumet%20%28pipe%29">peace calumet</a>. The Natchez reacted to this slight by killing four French traders. Cadillac sent his lieutenant <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Le%20Moyne%2C%20Sieur%20de%20Bienville">Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville</a> to punish the Natchez. He deceived the Natchez leaders by inviting them to attend a parley, where he ambushed and captured them, and forced the Natchez to exchange their leaders for the culprits who had attacked the French. A number of random Natchez from the pro-British villages were executed. This caused French–Natchez relations to further deteriorate. As part of the terms of the peace accord following this First Natchez War, the Natchez promised to supply labor and materials for the construction of a fort for the French. The fort was named <a href="Fort%20Rosalie">Fort Rosalie</a>, and it was aimed at protecting the French trade monopoly in the region from British incursions.

By 1717, French colonists had established the fort and a trading post in what is now <a href="Natchez%2C%20Mississippi">Natchez, Mississippi</a>. They also granted numerous <a href="Concession%20%28territory%29">concessions</a> for large plantations, as well as smaller farms, on land acquired from the Natchez. Relations between Natchez and colonists were generally friendly—some Frenchmen even married and had children with Natchez women—but there were tensions. There were reports of colonists abusing Natchez, forcing them to provide labor or goods, and as more colonists arrived, their concessions gradually encroached on Natchez lands.

From 1722 to 1724, brief armed conflicts between the Natchez and French were settled through negotiations between Louisiana governor Bienville and Natchez war chief Tattooed Serpent. In 1723, Bienville had been informed that some Natchez had harassed villagers, and he razed the Natchez village of <a href="Mazique%20Archeological%20Site">White Apple</a> and enslaved several villagers, only to discover that the alleged harassment had been faked by the colonists to frame the Natchez. One of the later skirmishes in 1724 consisted of the murder of a Natchez chief's son by a colonist, to which the Natchez responded by killing another Frenchman named Guenot. Bienville then sent French soldiers from New Orleans to attack the Natchez at their fields and settlements, and the Natchez surrendered. Their plea for peace was met following the execution of one of their chiefs by the French.

Chronicler Le Page du Pratz, who lived among the Natchez and was a close friend of Tattooed Serpent, records that he once asked his friend why the Natchez were resentful towards the French. Tattooed Serpent answered that the French seemed to have "two hearts, a good one today, and tomorrow a bad one", and proceeded to tell how Natchez life had been better before the French arrived. He finished by saying, "Before the arrival of the French we lived like men who can be satisfied with what they have, whereas today we live like slaves, who are not suffered to do as they please." The most faithful ally of the French, Tattooed Serpent died in 1725, another blow to the relations between the Natchez and the colonists.

According to archaeologist Karl Lorenz, who excavated several Natchez settlements, another factor that complicated relations between the Natchez and the colonists was the fact that the French did not well understand the Natchez political structure. The French assumed that the Great Sun, the chief of the Grand Village, also held sway over all the other Natchez villages. In truth, each village was semi-autonomous, and the Great Sun's power only extended to the villages of Flour and Tioux (with which the Grand Village was allied) and not to the three pro-British villages of White Apple, Jenzenaque and Grigra. When the Great Sun died in 1728 and was succeeded by his inexperienced nephew, the pro-British villages became more powerful than the pro-French villages centered at Natchez.

In 1728, Sieur de Chépart (also known as Etcheparre and Chopart), whom <a href="%C3%89tienne%20P%C3%A9rier%20%28governor%29">Governor Étienne Périer</a> had recently appointed as commandant of Fort Rosalie, was brought to New Orleans and put on trial before the governor for abuse of power, specifically behavior toward the Natchez that was unpopular among the French. Chépart was saved from punishment, however, by "the interference of influential friends", and upon returning to the fort, he continued to administer it as he had before. Chépart told the Natchez that November that he wished to seize land for a plantation in the center of White Apple, where the Natchez had a temple of their people's graves. Governor Périer sided with Chépart and planted a cross on the land he sought. By this point, most of the colonists disapproved of Chépart's actions, including <a href="Dumont%20de%20Montigny">Jean-François-Benjamin Dumont de Montigny</a>, a French historian who wrote that Chépart's demand marked the first time that a French colonial leader had simply claimed Natchez land as his own, without prior negotiations.

When the Natchez began to protest the seizure of their land for the plantation, Chépart said he would burn down the temple that contained their ancestors' graves. In response to this threat, the Natchez seemed to promise to cede the land, wrote Dumont de Montigny, but only if they were given two months to relocate their temple and graves. Chépart agreed to give them the time in exchange for pelts, oil, poultry, and grain—a request the Natchez promised to fulfill later.

The Natchez then began to prepare for a strike on the French at Fort Rosalie, borrowing firearms from some French colonists with promises to go hunting and to share the game with the guns' owners. Some French men and women overheard the Natchez planning such an attack. According to Le Page du Pratz, it was the Natchez female chief Tattooed Arm who attempted to alert the French of an upcoming attack led by her rivals at White Apple. When colonists told Chépart, he disregarded them and placed some in irons on the night before the massacre, when he was drunk.

On the morning of November 29, 1729, the Natchez came to Chépart with corn, poultry, and deerskins, also carrying with them a calumet—well known as a peace symbol. The commandant, still somewhat intoxicated from drinking the night before, was certain that the Natchez had no violent intentions, and he challenged those who had warned of an attack to prove that the rumors were accurate.

While Chépart was accepting the goods, the Natchez started firing, giving the signal for a coordinated attack on Fort Rosalie and on the outlying farms and concessions in the area now covered by the city of Natchez. Chépart ran to call his soldiers to arms, but they had already been killed. The details of the attack are mostly unknown, as chroniclers such as Le Page du Pratz, who talked with several eyewitnesses, stated that the events were "simply too horrific" to recount.

The Natchez had prepared by seizing the <a href="galley">galley</a> of the West India Company anchored on the river, so that no Frenchmen could board it and attempt to escape. They had also stationed warriors on the other side of the river to intercept those who might flee in that direction. The commandant at the <a href="Yazoo%20tribe">Yazoo</a> trading post of <a href="Fort%20St.%20Pierre%20Site">Fort St. Pierre</a>, Monsieur du Codère, was visiting Fort Rosalie with a Jesuit priest when they heard gunshots. They turned around to return to their ship, but warriors caught up with them, killing and scalping them.

The Natchez killed almost all of the 150 Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie, and only about 20 managed to escape. Most of the dead were unarmed. Women, children, and African slaves were mostly spared; many were locked inside a house on the bluff, guarded by several warriors, from where they could see the events. According to Dumont de Montigny's account of the attack, women seen defending their husbands from the violence, or trying to avenge them, were taken captive or killed. One woman's unborn baby was reportedly torn from her before she herself was killed. A year after the event, the tally of dead was put at 138 men, 35 women and 56 children, or approximately 230 overall. Some scholars argue that the Natchez spared the African slaves due to a general sense of affinity between the Natchez and the Africans; some slaves even joined the Natchez against their masters, while others took the chance to escape to freedom. A group of Yazoo people who were accompanying Commandant du Codère remained neutral during the conflict but were inspired by the Natchez revolt. When they returned to Fort St. Pierre, they destroyed the fort, killing the Jesuit priest and 17 French soldiers.

The Natchez lost only about 12 warriors during the attack. Eight warriors died attacking the homestead of the La Loire des Ursins family, where the men had been able to prepare a defense against the intruding Natchez.

Chépart himself was taken captive by the Natchez, who were at first unsure what to do with him, but finally decided that he should be killed by a stinkard—a member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was employed by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez beheaded the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great Sun to view.

News of the Fort Rosalie attack reached New Orleans in early December, and the colonists there began to panic. The city depended upon grain and other supplies from the Illinois settlement, and shipments up and down the Mississippi River would be threatened by the loss of Fort Rosalie. Governor Périer reacted to the massacre by forbidding the entry of a delegation of <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw people</a> into the city, for fear that they were using the pretext of a friendly visit to launch an attack. He then ordered slaves and French troops to march downstream and massacre a small village of <a href="Chaouacha">Chaouacha</a> people who had played no part in the uprising in Natchez. His superiors in Paris reprimanded the leader for this act, which may have been intended to prevent any alliance between slaves and Native Americans against the French colonists. Many Louisiana colonists—Dumont de Montigny in particular—blamed Chépart (who was killed by the Natchez) and Périer for the massacre; <a href="Louis%20XV%20of%20France">Louis XV</a>, the French king, ordered Périer back to France in 1732. Périer's replacement was his predecessor, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, whom the French state thought to be more experienced at dealing with the Native Americans of the region. A year earlier, the French West India Company had given up control of the colony to Louis XV because it had been costly and difficult to manage even before the rebellion.

More serious retaliation against the Natchez began late in December and in January 1730, with expeditions led by Jean-Paul Le Sueur and Henri de Louboëy. The two commanders besieged the Natchez in forts built near the site of the Grand Village of the Natchez, a mile or so east of Fort Rosalie, which had been rebuilt. They killed about 80 men and captured 18 women, and released some French women who had been captured during the massacre of Fort Rosalie. The French relied on allied support from <a href="Tunica%20people">Tunica</a> and Choctaw warriors. The Choctaw attacked the Natchez without the French, killing 100 and capturing women and children. This ruined the element of surprise for the French as the Natchez had already scattered. At first, the Natchez were well prepared for French retaliatory strikes, having stocked up several cannons as well as the firearms that they had used in the massacre two months earlier. The Natchez captured by the Choctaw and Tunica allies of the French were given over to the governor and sold into slavery, and some were publicly tortured to death in New Orleans.

In late February 1730, with Louboëy seeking to catch the Natchez by surprise, the Natchez negotiated a peace treaty and freed French captives, but the French planned an attack on the Natchez fort the following day. The Natchez then brought gifts to Louboëy, but left their fort that night and escaped across the Mississippi River, taking African slaves with them. The next day, Louboëy and his men burned down the abandoned Grand Village fort as the Natchez hid in the <a href="bayou">bayou</a>s along the Black River. A subsequent expedition led by Périer in 1731 to dislodge the Natchez captured many of them and their leaders, including Saint Cosme, who was the new Great Sun, and his mother—the Female Sun, Tattooed Arm. The 387 captives, most of whom had belonged to the pro-French faction of the Natchez, were sold into slavery in <a href="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a>. Many other Natchez escaped again, now taking refuge with the Chickasaw. Over the next decade the few hundred remaining Natchez lived a life on the run, waging a low-intensity guerrilla campaign against the French. French historian <a href="Pierre%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Xavier%20de%20Charlevoix">Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix</a> wrote in his history, "We were not slow in perceiving that the Natchez could still render themselves formidable, and that the step of sending the Sun and all who had been taken with him to be sold as slaves in Saint-Domingue, had rather exasperated than intimidated the remnant of that nation, in whom hatred and despair had transformed their natural pride and ferocity into a valor of which they were never deemed capable."

The French continued to press for the destruction of the Natchez who now lived among the Chickasaw, traditional allies of the British—this sparked the <a href="Chickasaw%20Wars">Chickasaw Wars</a>. The Chickasaw at first agreed to drive out the Natchez from among them, but they did not keep good on the promise. In the <a href="Chickasaw%20Campaign%20of%201736">Chickasaw Campaign of 1736</a>, the French, under Governor Bienville, attacked the Chickasaw villages of Apeony and Ackia, and then retreated, suffering significant casualties, but inflicting few. In the <a href="Chickasaw%20Campaign%20of%201739">Chickasaw Campaign of 1739</a>, Bienville summoned more than 1,000 troops to be sent over from France. Bienville's army ascended the Mississippi River to the site of present-day <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, and attempted to build a military road westward toward Chickasaw villages. After waiting for months in the winter of 1739–40, the French never mounted an attack and retreated back to New Orleans. After having suffered the attacks against the Chickasaw, the remaining Natchez moved on to live among the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> and <a href="Muscogee">Creek</a> people. By that time the Natchez, reduced to scattered refugees, had ceased to exist as a political entity.

The Natchez revolt figured as an event of monumental significance in French historiography and literature of the 18th and 19th centuries. In France, the massacre and its aftermath was described in numerous historical works and inspired several works of fiction. Eighteenth-century historians generally attributed the Natchez uprising to oppression by Commandant Chépart.

In the French sources, one important discussion has centered on the question of whether the Natchez planned a simultaneous attack on the French with the other major tribes of the region. French colonial governor Étienne Périer, in a report to superiors in France written one week after the revolt, claimed that many of the Indian nations in the lower <a href="Mississippi%20Alluvial%20Plain">Mississippi Valley</a> had plotted with the Natchez to attack the French on the same day and that even the Choctaw, who had been close allies of the French, were part of the plot. Périer then cancelled a meeting with the Choctaw planned for the first two days of December in New Orleans, contending that it was to be the occasion for an attack. Périer in this way defended his actions as governor by insinuating that the results of the massacre could have been worse if not for his prompt action. However, historians Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have pointed out that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in a 1730 unpublished narrative that Périer's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack. Another document in French, of anonymous authorship, asserted that the Natchez revolt was a British plan to destroy a new French tobacco business in Louisiana.

To describe the details of the attack and its background, Dumont de Montigny and <a href="Antoine-Simon%20Le%20Page%20du%20Pratz">Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz</a>, the leading 18th-century historians of Louisiana, drew on information collected from French women taken captive during the massacre. They explained that the Natchez had conspired with other nations but had attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon and that they had used a system of bundles of sticks held by each of the conspiring tribes in order to count down the number of days remaining until the strike. The undetected destruction of a couple of the sticks in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account. The other nations called off their participation in the plot because of the Natchez' premature attack, and therefore the very existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural.

<a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Chateaubriand">François-René de Chateaubriand</a> depicted the massacre in his 1827 epic "Les Natchez", incorporating his earlier best-selling novellas "<a href="Atala%20%28novella%29">Atala</a>" and "<a href="Ren%C3%A9%20%28novella%29">René</a>" into a longer narrative that greatly embellished the history of the French and the Natchez in Louisiana. In Chateaubriand's work, the grand conspiracy behind the massacre implausibly included native tribes from all across North America. Chateaubriand saw the Natchez Massacre as the defining moment in the history of the Louisiana colony, a position consistent with the views of other 18th-century historians, such as Le Page du Pratz and Dumont de Montigny.

The 19th-century Louisiana historian Charles Gayarré also embellished the story of a conspiracy behind the Natchez revolt, composing in his book a lengthy speech by the Great Sun in which the leader exhorted his warriors to invite the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Yazoo to join in the attack on the French. In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that more likely than not, the conspiracy claim was false because of incoherence in primary sources.

In contrast to the French tradition, the Natchez and their conflicts with the French have been mostly forgotten in contemporary American historiography. Historian Gordon Sayre attributes this to the fact that both the French and the Natchez were defeated in colonial wars before the birth of the United States.

Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)

The Crucifix by Cimabue at Santa Croce (c. 1265) is a wooden <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a>, painted in <a href="distemper%20%28paint%29">distemper</a>, attributed to the <a href="Florentine%20painting%23Before%201400">Florentine painter</a> and <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>ist <a href="Cimabue">Cimabue</a>, one of two large crucifixes attributed to him. The work was commissioned by the <a href="Franciscans">Franciscan friars</a> of <a href="Santa%20Croce%2C%20Florence">Santa Croce</a> and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary <a href="panel%20painting">timber boards</a>. It is one of the first <a href="Italian%20art">Italian art</a>works to break from the late medieval <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> style and is renowned for its technical innovations and <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanistic</a> iconography.

The <a href="gilding">gilding</a> and monumentality of the cross link it to the Byzantine tradition. <a href="Christ%20%28title%29">Christ</a>'s static pose is reflective of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more <a href="naturalism%20%28arts%29">naturalistic</a> aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically <a href="Crucifixion%20in%20the%20arts">imposing depiction</a> of the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">passion at Calvary</a>. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a> and <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Velázquez</a> to <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a>.

The work has been in the <a href="Basilica%20di%20Santa%20Croce%20di%20Firenze">Basilica di Santa Croce</a> in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> since the late thirteenth century, and at the Museo dell'Opera Santa Croce since restoration following <a href="1966%20flood%20of%20the%20Arno">flooding of the Arno</a> in 1966. It remains in poor condition despite <a href="Conservation-restoration%20of%20cultural%20heritage">conservation</a> efforts.

Both of Cimabue's surviving crucifixes were commissioned by the <a href="Franciscans">Franciscan order</a>. Founded by Saint <a href="Francis%20of%20Assisi">Francis of Assisi</a>, their reformist, religious and social views had a profound effect on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.

The church at Santa Croce was the third that the Franciscans constructed at the site. The first was begun in 1295, and is where Cimabue's "Crucifix" probably hung, given its large size, above the <a href="rood%20screen">rood screen</a>. It was later positioned at the north <a href="transept">transept</a>, in the <a href="sacristy">sacristy</a> and by the <a href="portico">entrance</a> on the southern flank.

Cimabue achieves a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches tended to be extremely colourful, with <a href="fresco">fresco</a>ed walls, painted <a href="capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a>, and <a href="gold%20leaf">gold leaf paintings</a>. Pale tonalities dominate, with the main contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand out more, and position his head as the focal point.

Compared to earlier works of this type, Christ's body is more physically corporeal, depicted as a real object, and his anatomy more <a href="figure%20painting">closely rendered</a>. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular <a href="halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29">nimbus</a> are placed at angles which rise outwards and above the level of the cross.

His body arches, forcing his torso to raise against the cross. Blood pours from the wounds in his hands as his head falls to the side from fatigue and the physical reality of approaching death. His body is naked except for a sheer and transparent <a href="perizoma%20%28loincloth%29">loincloth</a> that only just covers his thighs and buttocks. The choice of a white, veil-like loincloth, dramatically more modest than the red garment in the <a href="Arezzo">Arezzo</a> work, may be influenced by earlier crucifixions by <a href="Giunta%20Pisano">Giunta Pisano</a>. His nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering. It seems influenced by a thirteenth-century Franciscan "Meditation" on Christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in the suffering of the Passion; "Turn your eyes away from His divinity for a little while and consider Him purely as a man".
His eyes are open, and his skin is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or timeless sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, was known as the "<a href="Triumphant%20Christ">Christus triumphans</a>" ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary – especially Franciscan – taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the "<a href="Suffering%20Christ">Christus patiens</a>" ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce "Crucifix" is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.

The work surpasses Cimabue's c. 1268 Arezzo crucifix in several ways. It is more human and less reliant on idealised facial types, and the anatomy is more convincing. Christ's face is longer and narrower, and his nose less idealised. These features, according to art historian Robert Gibbs, give him "a coarser but more personal expression". A similar approach is taken with the cloth in the background of the cross itself, which although highly ornamented, lacks the lavish ornamentation of the equivalent cloth in the Arezzo cross.

His head hangs in exhaustion, and his hands bleed from the puncture wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher above his head and strain to carry the weight of his body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.

The painting contains elements typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions. But in other respects it conforms to the then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. Typical of depictions of the crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms he is as wide as he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.

Representations of <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">the Virgin</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a> flank Christ in small rectangular panels at either end of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the <a href="gilding">gilding</a> surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.

Their cloaks are simpler and lack the lavish gilding of the Arezzo crucifixion. The Virgin wears a red dress. Her robe was originally blue, but has darkened.

The crucifix measures 448 cm x 390 cm and consists of five basic physical components; a <a href="panel%20painting">vertical board</a> reaching from the base to the <a href="cymatium">cymatium</a> onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as <a href="apron%20%28architecture%29">aprons</a> adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical <a href="batten">batten</a>s. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.

Its dimensions are highly symmetrical and proportionate, probably influenced by the geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and <a href="dynamic%20rectangle">dynamic rectangle</a>s. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate the sway of Christ's body, altered the positioning of some of the boards on the lower half.

Due to lack of surviving documentation, it is difficult to attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the "Crucifix" has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Vasari</a> and <a href="Nicol%C3%B2%20Albertini">Nicolò Albertini</a>. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>, <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a> that established his reputation.

Rejecting these views, <a href="Joseph%20Archer%20Crowe">Joseph Archer Crowe</a> and <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Cavalcaselle">Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle</a> in 1903 concluded that the Santa Croce crucifix "in technical examination...makes some approach to the Florentine master, but it is rather of its time than by the master himself."

The crucifix was installed in the church of Santa Croce at the end of the thirteenth century and remained there until 1966 when the banks of the <a href="Arno">Arno</a> river <a href="1966%20flood%20of%20the%20Arno%20River">burst and flooded Florence</a>. Thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed; the "Crucifix" lost 60% of its paint. It had suffered earlier <a href="water%20damage">flood damage</a> in 1333 and 1557. In 1966 it was on display in the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it was located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's <a href="halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29">halo</a> and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a> on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand and bend, cracking the paint-work.
A team of <a href="Conservation-restoration%20of%20cultural%20heritage">restorers</a> led by conservators <a href="Umberto%20Baldini">Umberto Baldini</a> and Ornella Casazza at the "Laboratario del Restauro" in Florence spent ten years reapplying paint. They worked in an almost <a href="pointillism">pointillist</a> manner, with the aid of computer modelling. The tiny specks of pigment floating around the piece were recovered with pliers by staff wading in the water after the torrents had subsided. The wooden frame had significantly weakened, and it was necessary to separate it from both the <a href="gesso">gesso</a> and canvas to prevent <a href="buckling">buckling</a> as the reapplied paint dried. The restorers succeeded in returning the work close to its original appearance, and it was put back on public display in 1976.

The international press covered the restoration; since then the work has been lent to galleries outside Italy, the first time it had left Florence since its creation. According to the critic <a href="Waldemar%20Januszczak">Waldemar Januszczak</a>, it was brought "around the globe in a curious, post-restoration state—part original artwork, part masterpiece of modern science ... a thirteenth century—twentieth-century hybrid."

Amir Hamzah

Tengku Amir Hamzah (<a href="Jawi%20alphabet">Jawi</a>: ; 28 February 1911 – 20 March 1946) was an Indonesian poet and <a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Indonesia">National Hero of Indonesia</a>. Born into a <a href="Malay%20people">Malay</a> aristocratic family in the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Langkat">Sultanate of Langkat</a> in <a href="North%20Sumatra">North Sumatra</a>, he was educated in both <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> and <a href="Java">Java</a>. While attending senior high school in <a href="Surakarta">Surakarta</a> around 1930, the youth became involved with the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Awakening">nationalist movement</a> and fell in love with a <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a> schoolmate, Ilik Sundari. Even after Amir continued his studies in legal school in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>) the two remained close, only separating in 1937 when Amir was recalled to Sumatra to marry the sultan's daughter and take on responsibilities of the court. Though unhappy with his marriage, he fulfilled his courtly duties. After <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">Indonesia proclaimed its independence</a> in 1945, he served as the government's representative in Langkat. The following year he was killed in <a href="East%20Sumatra%20revolution">a socialist revolution</a> led by the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Indonesia">Communist Party of Indonesia</a> and buried in a mass grave.

Amir began writing poetry while still a teenager: though his works are undated, the earliest are thought to have been written when he first travelled to Java. Drawing influences from his own Malay culture and Islam, as well as from Christianity and Eastern literature, Amir wrote 50 poems, 18 pieces of lyrical prose, and numerous other works, including several translations. In 1932 he co-founded the literary magazine "<a href="Poedjangga%20Baroe">Poedjangga Baroe</a>". After his return to Sumatra, he stopped writing. Most of his poems were published in two collections, "<a href="Nyanyi%20Sunyi">Nyanyi Sunyi</a>" (1937) and "<a href="Buah%20Rindu">Buah Rindu</a>" (1941), first in "Poedjangga Baroe" then as stand-alone books.

Poems by Amir deal with the themes of love and religion and his poetry often reflects a deep inner conflict. His <a href="diction">diction</a>, using both <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> and <a href="Javanese%20language">Javanese</a> words and expanding on traditional structures, was influenced by the need for <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a> and <a href="Metre%20%28poetry%29">metre</a>, as well as <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ism related to particular terms. His earlier works deal with a sense of longing and both erotic and idealised love, whereas his later works have a deeper religious meaning. Of his two collections, "Nyanyi Sunyi" is considered the most developed. Amir has been called the "King of the Poedjangga Baroe-era Poets" and the only international-class Indonesian poet from before the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>.

Amir was born as Tengkoe Amir Hamzah Pangeran Indra Poetera in Tanjung Pura, <a href="Langkat%20Regency">Langkat</a>, <a href="North%20Sumatra">North Sumatra</a>, the youngest son of Vice Sultan Tengku Muhammad Adil and his <a href="polygamy">third wife</a> Tengku Mahjiwa. Through his father, he was related to the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Langkat">Sultan of Langkat</a>, Machmud. Sources disagree over his date of birth. The date officially recognised by the Indonesian government is 28 February 1911, a date Amir used throughout his life. However, his elder brother Abdullah Hod states that the poet was born on 11 February 1911. Amir later took the name of his grandfather, Teungku Hamzah, as a second name; thus, he was referred to as Amir Hamzah. Though a child of nobility, he would often associate with non-nobles.

It is known that Amir was schooled in Islamic principles such as <a href="Qu%27ran%20reading">Qu'ran reading</a>, "<a href="fiqh">fiqh</a>", and "<a href="tawhid">tawhid</a>", and studied at the Azizi Mosque in Tanjung Pura from a young age. He remained a devout Muslim throughout his life. Sources disagree on the period in which he completed his formal studies. Several sources, including the Indonesian government's Language Centre, state that he started school in 1916, while the biographer M. Lah Husny puts the future poet's first year of formal schooling as 1918. At the Dutch-language elementary school where Amir first studied, he began writing and received good marks; in her biography of him, <a href="Nh.%20Dini">Nh. Dini</a> writes that Amir was nicknamed "older brother" ("abang") by his classmates as he was much taller than them.

In 1924 or 1925, Amir graduated from the school in Langkat and moved to <a href="Medan">Medan</a> to study at the "<a href="Meer%20Uitgebreid%20Lager%20Onderwijs">Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs</a>" (MULO; middle school) there. After completing his studies some two years later, he entered a formal relationship with his cousin from his mother's side, Aja (also Aje) Bun. Husny writes that the two were <a href="arranged%20marriage">arranged</a> to be married by their parents, while Dini casts the relationship as a vow to be always faithful. As his parents permitted him to finish his studies in <a href="Java">Java</a>, Amir moved to the colonial capital at <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>) to complete his studies.

Alone aboard the "Plancus", Amir made the three-day boat trip to Java. Upon arriving at Batavia, he enrolled at a Christian MULO there, where he completed his last year of junior high school. Anthony H. Johns of <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> writes that he learned some Christian concepts and values. Also in Batavia, Amir became involved with the social organisation Jong Sumatera. During this period, the young man wrote his first poems. Husny credits several to his heartbreak after he found that Aja Bun had been married to another man without Amir's knowing (the two never spoke again), while Dini suggests that the poem "Tinggallah" was written not long after he boarded the "Plancus", while he was longing after his parents.
After a brief return to Sumatra, Amir continued to a <a href="Boedi%20Oetomo">Boedi Oetomo</a>-operated "Algemene Middelbare School" (AMS; senior high school) in <a href="Surakarta">Surakarta</a>, <a href="Central%20Java">Central Java</a>, where he studied eastern literature and languages, including <a href="Javanese%20language">Javanese</a>, <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, and <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>. Preferring solitude to the bustle of the dormitories, Amir boarded at a privately owned home of a Surakartan resident. Later he met several future writers, including <a href="Armijn%20Pane">Armijn Pane</a> and <a href="Achdiat%20Karta%20Mihardja">Achdiat Karta Mihardja</a>; they soon found him to be a friendly and diligent student with complete notes and a spotless bedroom (sheets folded so well, Mihardja later recalled, that a "lost fly could have easily slid over them"), but also a romantic prone to thinking wistfully beneath the lamplight and isolating himself from his classmates.

In Surakarta Amir joined the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Awakening">nationalist movement</a>. He would meet with fellow Sumatrans and discuss the social plight of the Malay archipelago's populace under Dutch colonial rule. Though most educated youth at the time preferred using Dutch, he insisted on speaking Malay. In 1930 Amir became head of the Surakartan branch of the Indonesia Muda (Young Indonesians), delivering a speech at the 1930 Youth Congress and serving as an editor of the organisation's magazine "Garuda Merapi". At school he also met Ilik Sundari, a <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a> woman nearly his age with whom he fell in love. Sundari, the daughter of <a href="Raden%20Mas">Raden Mas</a> Kusumodihardjo, was one of the few female students at the school, and her home was near one of those in which Amir boarded. According to Dini, the two grew closer, Amir teaching Sundari Arabic and Sundari teaching him Javanese. They were soon meeting every day, conversing on a variety of topics.

Amir's mother died in 1931, and his father the year after, meaning that his education could no longer be funded. After his AMS studies concluded, he wanted to continue to study at a law school in Batavia. As such, he wrote to his brother, Jakfar, who arranged for the remainder of his studies to be paid for by the Sultan. In 1932 Amir was able to return to Batavia and begin his legal studies, taking up a part-time job as a teacher. At first, his relationship with Sundari was continued through letters, though she soon continued her studies in <a href="Lembang">Lembang</a>, a city much closer than Surakarta; this allowed the two to meet furtively – when Sundari's parents had discovered their relationship, Amir and Sundari had been forbidden from meeting.

This year Amir's first two poems, "Sunyi" ("Silent") and "Mabuk..." ("Nauseous..."), were published in the March edition of the magazine "<a href="Timboel">Timboel</a>". His other eight works published in 1932 included a "<a href="syair">syair</a>" based on the "<a href="Hikayat%20Hang%20Tuah">Hikayat Hang Tuah</a>", three other poems, two pieces of <a href="prose%20poem">lyrical prose</a>, and two short stories; the poems were again published in "Timboel", while the prose was included in the magazine "<a href="Pandji%20Poestaka">Pandji Poestaka</a>". Around September 1932 Armijn Pane, upon the urgings of <a href="Sutan%20Takdir%20Alisjahbana">Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana</a>, editor of "Memadjoekan Sastera" ("Advancing Literature", the literary section of "Pandji Poestaka"), invited Amir to help them establish an independent literary magazine. Amir accepted, and was tasked with writing letters to solicit submissions; a total of fifty letters were sent to noted writers, including forty sent to contributors to "Memadjoekan Sastera". After several months of preparations, the initial edition was published in July 1933, under the title "<a href="Poedjangga%20Baroe">Poedjangga Baroe</a>". The new magazine was left under the editorial control of Armijn and Alisjahbana, while Amir published almost all of his subsequent writings there.

In mid-1933 Amir was recalled to Langkat, where the Sultan informed him of two conditions which he had to fulfil to continue his studies: be a diligent student and abandon the independence movement. Despite the Sultan's disapproval, Amir became more heavily involved in the nationalist movement, bringing him under increasing Dutch scrutiny. He continued to publish in "Poedjangga Baroe", including a series of five articles on Eastern literatures from June to December 1934 and a translation of the "<a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>" from 1933 to 1935. His legal studies, however, were delayed, and by 1937 he had still not graduated.

The Dutch, concerned about Amir's nationalistic tendencies, convinced the Sultan to send him back to Langkat, an order which the fledgling poet was unable to refuse. In 1937, Amir, together with two of the Sultan's vassals tasked with escorting him, boarded the "Opten Noort" from <a href="Tanjung%20Priok">Tanjung Priok</a> and returned to Sumatra. Upon arriving in Langkat, he was informed that he was to be married to the Sultan's eldest daughter, Tengku Puteri Kamiliah, a woman he had barely met. Before the wedding Amir returned to Batavia to face his final exam – and have one last meeting with Sundari. Several weeks later he returned to Langkat, where he and Kamiliah were married in an extravagant ceremony. His cousin, Tengku Burhan, later stated that Amir's indifference throughout the seven-day event was due to his thinking of Sundari.

Now a prince ("pangeran"), Amir was given the title Tengku Pangeran Indra Putera. He lived with Kamiliah in their own home. By all accounts, she was a devout and loving wife, and in 1939 the couple had their only child, a daughter named Tengku Tahura. According to Dini, Amir professed to Kamiliah that he could never love her as he had Sundari and that he felt obligated to marry her, something which Kamiliah reportedly accepted. The poet retained an album with his Javanese sweetheart's photographs at home and would often isolate himself from his family, lost in thought. As a prince of Langkat, Amir became a court official, handling administrative and legal matters, and at times judging criminal cases. He once represented the sultanate at the funeral of <a href="Pakubuwono%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX">Pakubuwono X</a> in Java – Amir's last trip to the island.

Although Amir had little correspondence with his friends in Java, his poems – most of which had been written in Java – continued to be published in "Poedjangga Baroe". His first poetry collection, "<a href="Nyanyi%20Sunyi">Nyanyi Sunyi</a>" ("Songs of Silence"), was published in the magazine's November 1937 edition. Nearly two years later, in June 1939, the magazine published a collection of poems Amir had translated, entitled "Setanggi Timur" ("Incense from the East"). In June 1941 his last collection, "<a href="Buah%20Rindu">Buah Rindu</a>" ("Fruits of Longing"), was published. All were later republished as stand-alone books. A last book, "Sastera Melayu Lama dan Raja-Rajanya" ("Old Malay Literature and its Kings"), was published in Medan in 1942; this was based on a radio speech Amir had delivered.

After the <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20the%20Netherlands">German invasion of the Netherlands</a> in 1940, the government of the Indies began preparing for a possible Japanese invasion. In Langkat, a Home Guard, or "Stadswacht", division was established to defend Tanjung Pura, in Langkat. Amir and his cousin Tengku Harun were in charge; the nobility, trusted by the general populace, was selected to ensure easier recruitment of commoners. When the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">invasion</a> became a reality in early 1942, Amir was one of the soldiers sent to Medan to defend it. He and the other Dutch-allied forces were quickly captured by the Japanese. He was held as a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> until 1943, when influence from the Sultan allowed him to be released. Throughout the remainder of the occupation, which lasted until 1945, Amir was employed as a radio commentator and censor in Medan. In his position as prince, he was tasked with helping to collect rice to feed the Japanese occupation army.

After <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">Indonesia proclaimed its independence</a> on 17 August 1945, the entirety of Sumatra was declared a "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" part of the country. The central government established <a href="Teuku%20Muhammad%20Hasan">Teuku Muhammad Hasan</a> as the island's first governor, and on 29 October 1945 Hasan selected Amir as the government representative in Langkat (later equated to <a href="bupati">regent</a>), with his office at <a href="Binjai">Binjai</a>. Amir accepted the position readily, subsequently handling numerous tasks set by the central government, including inaugurating the first local division of the People's Safety Army ("Tentara Keamanan Rakjat"; the predecessor to the <a href="Indonesian%20Army">Indonesian Army</a>) opening meetings of various local branches of national political parties, and promoting education – particularly Latin-alphabet literacy.

The ongoing <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>, with various battles in Java, meant that the newly established republic was unstable. In early 1946, rumours spread in Langkat that Amir had been seen dining with representatives of the returning Dutch government, and there was growing unrest within the general populace. On 7 March 1946, during a <a href="East%20Sumatra%20revolution">socialist revolution</a> led by factions of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Indonesia">Communist Party of Indonesia</a>, a group staunchly against <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> and the nobility, Amir's power was stripped from him and he was arrested; Kamiliah and Tahura escaped. Together with other members of the Langkat nobility, he was sent to a Communist-held plantation at Kuala Begumit, some outside of Binjai. Later testimony suggests that the detainees were tried by their captors, forced to dig holes, and tortured.

Amir's last piece of writing, a <a href="Literary%20fragment">fragment</a> from his 1941 poem "Buah Rindu", was later found in his cell:

On the morning of 20 March 1946, Amir was killed with 26 other people and buried in a mass grave which the detainees had dug; several of his siblings were also killed in the revolution. After it was quashed by nationalist forces, the revolution's leaders were questioned by a team led by <a href="Amir%20Sjarifuddin">Amir Sjarifuddin</a> and <a href="Adnan%20Kapau%20Gani">Adnan Kapau Gani</a>: they are reported to have repeatedly asked "Where is Amir Hamzah?" during the investigation. In 1948 the grave at Kuala Begumit was dug up and the remains identified by family members; Amir's bones were identified owing to a missing <a href="dentures">false tooth</a>. In November 1949 his body was reinterred at the Azizi Mosque in Tanjung Pura, Langkat.

Amir was raised in a court setting, where he spoke Malay until it had "become his flesh and blood". From a young age he was exposed to <a href="oral%20literature">oral</a> and written "pantuns" and "syair", both listening and improvisationally creating his own. As with his father before him, Amir enjoyed traditional texts, such as "<a href="Hikayat%20Hang%20Tuah">Hikayat Hang Tuah</a>", "<a href="Syair%20Siti%20Zubaidah">Syair Siti Zubaidah</a>", and "<a href="Hikayat%20Panca%20Tanderan">Hikayat Panca Tanderan</a>". He would listen to these when they were read in public ceremonies, and as an adult he kept a large collection of such texts, though these were destroyed during the communist revolution.

Throughout his formal education Amir read works of <a href="Arabic%20literature">Arabic</a>, <a href="Persian%20literature">Persian</a>, and <a href="Hindu%20literature">Hindu literature</a>. He was also influenced by works from other Eastern countries: poems translated in "Setanggi Timur", for instance, include works by <a href="Omar%20Khayy%C3%A1m">Omar Khayyám</a> (Persia), <a href="Du%20Fu">Du Fu</a> (China), <a href="Fukuda%20Chiyo-ni">Fukuda Chiyo-ni</a> (Japan), and <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a> (India). These works were not read in the original, but from Dutch translations. The literary critic <a href="Muhammad%20Balfas">Muhammad Balfas</a> writes that, unlike his contemporaries, Amir drew little influence from <a href="sonnet">sonnet</a>s and the <a href="neo-romantic">neo-romantic</a> Dutch poets, the "<a href="Tachtigers">Tachtigers</a>"; Johns comes to the same conclusion. The Australian literary scholar Keith Foulcher, however, noting that the poet quoted <a href="Willem%20Kloos">Willem Kloos</a>'s "Lenteavond" in his article on "pantuns", suggests that Amir was very likely influenced by the "Tachtigers".
Many writers have commented on Amir's influence from Islamic doctrine. The Indonesian literary documentarian <a href="H.B.%20Jassin">H.B. Jassin</a> and the poet Arief Bagus Prasetyo, among others, argue that Amir was a purely orthodox Muslim and that it showed in his work. Prasetyo argues that this was evident in his treatment of God; he does not view God as his equal, a theme found in the works of such <a href="Sufism">Sufi</a> poets as <a href="Hamzah%20Fansuri">Hamzah Fansuri</a>, but as the master to Amir's servant. Johns writes that, though he was not a mystic, Amir was also not a purely devotional writer, instead promoting a form of "Islamic Humanism". Others, such as the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature <a href="A.%20Teeuw">A. Teeuw</a> and the Indonesian scholar of literature Abdul Hadi WM, find Amir to be influenced by Sufism. Aprinus Salam of <a href="Gadjah%20Mada%20University">Gadjah Mada University</a>, of the same position, points to the instances where Hamzah treats God as a lover as indicative of Sufi influence. Ultimately, the poet <a href="Chairil%20Anwar">Chairil Anwar</a> wrote that Amir's "Nyanyi Sunyi" could be termed "obscure poetry" as readers cannot understand the works without prior knowledge of Malay history and Islam.

Some attempts have also been made to connect Amir's works to a Christian perspective. In analysing "Padamu Jua", the Indonesian critic <a href="Bakri%20Siregar">Bakri Siregar</a> suggests that some influences from the Christian <a href="Bible">Bible</a> are evident, pointing to several aspects of the poem that would seem to support such a view, including the depiction of an <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> God (not allowed in orthodox Islam) and the idea of a jealous God. He writes that the concept of a jealous God is not found in Islam, but is in the Bible, citing and . In another poem, "Permainanmu", Hamzah uses the sentence "Kau keraskan kalbunya" (You harden his heart); Jassin draws a parallel to God hardening the Pharaoh's heart in the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a>.

Jassin writes that Amir's poems were also influenced by his love for one or more women, in "Buah Rindu" referred to as "Tedja" and "Sendari-Dewi"; he opines that the woman or women are never named as Amir's love for them is the key. Husny writes that at least nine of the works in "Buah Rindu" were inspired by his longing for Aja Bun, portraying a sense of disappointment after their engagement was called off. Regarding the book's three-part dedication, "to the mournful <a href="Greater%20Indonesia">Greater Indonesia</a> / to the ashes of the Mother-Queen / and to the feet of the Sendari-Goddess", Mihardja writes that Sundari was immediately recognisable to any of Amir's classmates; he considers her the poet's inspiration as "Laura to <a href="Petrarch">Petrarch</a>, Mathilde to <a href="Jacques%20Perk">Jacques Perk</a>". The critic <a href="Zuber%20Usman">Zuber Usman</a> finds Sundari's influence on "Nyanyi Sunyi" as well, suggesting his parting from her led Amir closer to God, an opinion Dini echoes. The translator <a href="Burton%20Raffel">Burton Raffel</a> connects a couplet at the end of the book, reading "" ("A flower floating in a loose knot of hair / Gave birth to my sorrowful poems") as a call out to a forbidden love. Dini credits Amir's love for Sundari for his frequent use of Javanese terms in his writing.

Altogether Amir wrote fifty poems, eighteen pieces of lyrical prose, twelve articles, four short stories, three poetry collections, and one original book. He also translated forty-four poems, one piece of lyrical prose, and one book; these translations, Johns writes, generally reflected themes important in his original work.

The vast majority of Amir's writings were published in "Poedjangga Baroe", although some earlier ones were published in "Timboel" and "Pandji Poestaka". None of his creative works are dated, and there is no consensus regarding when individual poems were written. However, there is a consensus that the works included in "Nyanyi Sunyi" were written after those included in "Buah Rindu", despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; he points to the various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.

Jassin writes that Amir maintained a Malay identity throughout his works, despite attending schools run by Europeans. Unlike the works of his contemporaries Alisjahbana or <a href="Sanusi%20Pane">Sanusi Pane</a>, his poems did not include symbols of a Europeanised modernity such as electricity, trains, telephones, and engines, allowing "the natural Malay world to show wholly". Ultimately, when reading Amir's poems "in our imagination we do not see a man in pants, a jacket, and tie, but a youth in traditional Malay garb". Mihardja notes that Amir wrote his works at a time when all of their classmates, and many poets elsewhere, were "pouring their hearts or thoughts" in Dutch, or, if "able to free themselves from the shackles of Dutch", in <a href="Languages%20of%20Indonesia">a local language</a>.

Amir's work often dealt with love (both erotic and idealised), with religious influences showing in many of his poems. <a href="Mysticism">Mysticism</a> is important in many of his works, and his poetry often reflects a deep inner conflict. In at least one of his short stories, he criticised the traditional view of nobility and "subverts the traditional representation of female characters". There are several thematic differences between his two original poetry collections, discussed further below.

"Nyanyi Sunyi", Amir's first poetry collection, was published in the November 1937 issue of "Poedjangga Baroe", then as a stand-alone book by Poestaka Rakjat in 1938. It consists of twenty-four titled pieces and an untitled <a href="quatrain">quatrain</a>, including Hamzah's best-known poem, "<a href="Padamu%20Jua">Padamu Jua</a>". Jassin classifies eight of these works as <a href="Prose%20poetry">lyrical prose</a>, with the remaining thirteen as regular poems. Although it is his first published collection, based on the well-developed nature of the poems within, general consensus is that the works in "Buah Rindu" were written earlier. The poet Laurens Koster Bohang considers the poems included in "Nyanyi Sunyi" as having been written between 1933 and 1937, while Teeuw dates the poems to 1936 and 1937.

Readings of "Nyanyi Sunyi" have tended to focus on religious undertones. According to Balfas, religion and God are omnipresent throughout the collection, beginning with its first poem "Padamu Jua". In it, Jassin writes, Amir shows a feeling of dissatisfaction over his own lack of power and protests God's absoluteness, but seems aware of his own smallness before God, acting as a puppet for God's will. Teeuw summarises that Amir recognises that he would not exist if God did not. Jassin finds that the theme of religion is meant as an escape from the poet's worldly sorrows. Johns, however, suggests that ultimately Amir finds little solace in God, as he "did not possess the transcendent faith which can make a great sacrifice, and resolutely accept the consequences"; instead, he seems to regret his choice to go to Sumatra and then revolts against God.

Amir's second poetry collection, "Buah Rindu", was published in the June 1941 issue of "Poedjangga Baroe", then as a stand-alone book by Poestaka Rakjat later that year. It consists of twenty-five titled pieces and an untitled quatrain; one, "Buah Rindu", consists of four parts, while another, "Bonda", consists of two. At least eleven of the works had previously been published, either in "Timboel" or in "Pandji Poestaka". This collection though published after "Nyanyi Sunyi", is generally considered to have been written earlier. The poems in "Buah Rindu" date to the period between 1928 and 1935, Amir's first years in Java; the collection gives the two years, as well the location of writing as Jakarta–Solo (Surakarta)–Jakarta.

Teeuw writes that this collection is united by a theme of longing, which Jassin expands on: longing for his mother, longing for his lovers (both the one in Sumatra and the one in Java), and longing for his homeland. All are referred to as "kekasih" ("beloved") in turn. These longings, Teeuw writes, are unlike the religious overtones of "Nyanyi Sunyi", being more worldly and grounded in reality. Jassin notes another thematic distinction between the two: unlike "Nyanyi Sunyi", with its clear depiction of <a href="monotheism">one god</a>, "Buah Rindu" explicitly puts forth several deities, including the Hindu gods <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> and <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a> and abstract ones like the god and goddess of love.

Amir's <a href="diction">diction</a> was influenced by the need for <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a> and <a href="Metre%20%28poetry%29">metre</a>, as well as <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ism related to particular terms. This careful diction emphasised simple words as the basic unit and occasional uses of <a href="alliteration">alliteration</a> and <a href="assonance">assonance</a>. Ultimately he is freer in his language use than traditional poets: Jennifer Lindsay and Ying Ying Tan highlight his "verbal inventiveness", injecting a "lavishness of expression, a mellifluous of sound and meaning" into his poetry. Siregar writes that the result is "a beautiful wordplay". Teeuw writes that Amir had a complete understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>, mixing eastern and western influences, whilst Johns writes that his "genius as a poet lay in his remarkable ability to resurrect the burnt-out embers of Malay poetry, and to infuse into the forms and rich vocabulary of traditional Malay an unexpected and vivid freshness and life."

The choice of words depends heavily on old <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> terms which saw little contemporary use. Amir also borrows heavily from other Indonesian languages, particularly Javanese and <a href="Sundanese%20language">Sundanese</a>; the influences are more predominant in "Nyanyi Sunyi". As such, early printings of "Nyanyi Sunyi" and "Buah Rindu" were accompanied by footnotes explaining these words. Teeuw writes that the poems included numerous <a href="clich%C3%A9">cliché</a>s common in "pantuns" which would not be understood by foreign readers. According to the translator John M. Echols, Amir was a writer of great sensitivity who was "not a prolific writer but his prose and poetry are on a very high level, though difficult reading even for Indonesians." Echols credits Amir with a revival of the Malay language, breathing new life into Malay literature in the 1930s.

Structurally, Amir's early works are quite different from his later ones. The works compiled in "Buah Rindu" generally followed the traditional "<a href="pantun">pantun</a>" and "syair" style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with <a href="rhyming%20couplets">rhyming couplets</a>; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, resulting in a different rhythm. Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as "menangis" (cry), "duka" (grief), "rindu" (longing), and "air mata" (tears), as well as words such as "cinta" (love), "asmara" (passion), and "merantau" (wander).

By the time Amir wrote the works later compiled in "Nyanyi Sunyi," his style had shifted. No longer did he confine himself to the traditional forms, but instead he explored different possibilities: eight of his works approached lyrical prose in form. Anwar described his predecessor's use of language in the collection as clean and pure, with "compactly violent, sharp, and yet short" sentences which departed from the "destructive force" of flowery traditional Malay poetry.

Amir has received extensive recognition from the Indonesian government, beginning with recognition from the government of North Sumatra soon after his death. In 1969 he was granted both a Satya Lencana Kebudayaan (Satya Lencana Award for Culture) and Piagam Anugerah Seni (Art Prize). In 1975 he was declared a <a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Indonesia">National Hero of Indonesia</a>. A park named after him, Taman Amir Hamzah, is found in Jakarta near the <a href="Monas">National Monument</a>. A mosque in <a href="Taman%20Ismail%20Marzuki">Taman Ismail Marzuki</a>, opened to the public in 1977, is also named after him. Several streets are named after Amir, including in Medan, <a href="Mataram%20%28city%29">Mataram</a>, and <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>.

Teeuw considers Amir the only international-class Indonesian poet from before the Indonesian National Revolution. Anwar wrote that the poet was the "summit of the "Pudjangga Baru" movement", considering "Nyanyi Sunyi" to have been a "bright light he [Amir] shone on the new language"; however, Anwar disliked "Buah Rindu", considering it too classical. Balfas describes Amir's works as "the best literary products to surpass their time". Hamzah's work, particularly "Padamu Jua", is taught in Indonesian schools. His œuvre was also one of the inspirations for <a href="Afrizal%20Malna">Afrizal Malna</a>'s 1992 <a href="postmodern">postmodern</a> stage play "Biografi Yanti setelah 12 Menit" ("Biography of Yanti After 12 Minutes").

Jassin has called Amir the "King of the Pudjangga Baru-era Poets", a name he used as the title of his book on the poet. In closing his book, Jassin writes:

The Thrill Book

The Thrill Book was a U.S. <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a> in 1919. It was intended to carry "different" stories: this meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable, which in practice often meant that the stories were <a href="Fantasy%20genre">fantasy</a> or <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>. The first eight issues, edited by <a href="Harold%20Hersey">Harold Hersey</a>, were a mixture of <a href="adventure%20fiction">adventure</a> and <a href="Weird%20fiction">weird stories</a>. Contributors included <a href="Greye%20La%20Spina">Greye La Spina</a>, <a href="Fulton%20Oursler">Charles Fulton Oursler</a>, J. H. Coryell, and <a href="Seabury%20Quinn">Seabury Quinn</a>. Hersey was replaced by Ronald Oliphant with the July 1 issue, probably because Street & Smith were unhappy with his performance.

Oliphant printed more science fiction and fantasy than Hersey had done, though this included two stories by <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a> which Hersey had purchased before being replaced. The most famous story from "The Thrill Book" is "<a href="The%20Heads%20of%20Cerberus">The Heads of Cerberus</a>", a very early example of a novel about alternate time tracks, by <a href="Francis%20Stevens">Francis Stevens</a>. Oliphant was given a larger budget than Hersey, and was able to acquire material by popular writers such as <a href="H.%20Bedford-Jones">H. Bedford-Jones</a>, but he was only able to produce eight more issues before the end came. The last issue was dated October 15, 1919; it was probably cancelled because of poor sales, although a printers' strike at that time may have been a factor.

Although "The Thrill Book" has been described as the first American pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction, this description is not supported by recent historians of the field, who regard it instead as a stepping stone on the path that ultimately led to "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>" and "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", the first true specialized magazines in the fields of weird fiction and science fiction respectively.

In the late 19th century popular magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content; they would include non-fiction articles and poetry as well. In October 1896, the Frank A. Munsey company's "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">Argosy</a>" magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction, and in December of that year it switched to using cheap wood-pulp paper. This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> era. For twenty years pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre, but in 1915 the influential magazine publisher <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a> began to issue titles that focused on a particular niche, such as "<a href="Detective%20Story%20Magazine">Detective Story Magazine</a>" and "<a href="Western%20Story%20Magazine">Western Story Magazine</a>", thus pioneering the specialized and single-genre pulps. In the midst of these changes, some time in 1918, Street & Smith's circulation manager, Henry Ralston, decided to launch a new magazine to publish "different" stories: ""different"" meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable in some way, which in most cases meant that they included either fantasy or science fiction elements. In "The Fiction Factory", Quentin Reynolds' history of Street & Smith, Reynolds asserts that the magazine was the brainchild of <a href="Ormond%20Gerald%20Smith">Ormond G. Smith</a>, one of the publishers, but pulp historian <a href="Will%20Murray">Will Murray</a> regards this as unlikely to be the full story, given that Reynolds' book was written almost forty years later and was an "approved" history. Murray asserts that Ralston was certainly involved in the creation of "The Thrill Book". Walter Adolphe Roberts, the editor of Street & Smith's "<a href="Ainslee%27s%20Magazine">Ainslee's Magazine</a>", told a friend of his, <a href="Harold%20Hersey">Harold Hersey</a>, that Ralston was looking for an editor for a new magazine. Hersey had sold some writing to the pulps but his editorial experience was limited to no more than a year's work on several <a href="little%20magazine">little magazine</a>s. He met with Ralston in early 1919 and was immediately hired on the basis of the interview. It is possible that Eugene A. Clancy, the editor of Street & Smith's "<a href="The%20Popular%20Magazine">The Popular Magazine</a>", was originally intended to be the editor of "The Thrill Book", but was unable to take on the additional work, though Clancy did assist Hersey on some issues of "The Thrill Book". Bringing Hersey on as editor was unfortunate; historians of the field describe Hersey as lacking talent both as a writer and an editor.

The first issue of "The Thrill Book" was dated March 1, 1919, and was published in a format similar to that of a <a href="dime%20novel">dime novel</a>. The choice of format was probably a mistake, as it was associated in the minds of the buying public with low-quality fiction aimed at readers with very low standards. The plan to publish twice a month indicated that Street & Smith were confident that the new magazine would be successful.

With the ninth issue, dated July 1, 1919, Hersey was replaced by Ronald Oliphant. The reason he was replaced is not clear, though several explanations have been suggested. <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a> claimed that Hersey was fired for publishing too much of his own fiction and poetry in the magazine; according to Leinster, some of the poetry may have actually been written by Hersey's mother rather than by Hersey himself. Pulp historian <a href="Richard%20Bleiler">Richard Bleiler</a> regards this theory as unlikely, since although up to eighteen of the twenty-five short poems in the first eight issues of the magazine may have been by Hersey, only two stories in those issues are definitely by him, and there are only four other stories which may have been Hersey's work published under a pseudonym. Bleiler suggests that at most Street & Smith would have reprimanded Hersey, and that the real reason for his dismissal is more likely to be that Street & Smith were dissatisfied with "The Thrill Book" under his editorship. Bleiler also suggests that Hersey may have started the rumor that he was let go for buying too much of his own material, as this would have been less harmful to his reputation than a dismissal for failure. Hersey himself claimed that he was not fired, but quit: "I wasn't fired, but I should have been ... I saw the 'handwriting on the wall' ahead of time. I asked to be relieved of my duties ... and my request was promptly accepted!"

At the same time that Oliphant was appointed editor, the layout of the magazine was changed to that of a standard pulp. At 160 pages, this offered readers much better value for money than the 48-page dime novel format of the first eight issues, even with a price increase from 10 to 15 cents. A question and answer department, "Cross-Trails", was begun, in imitation of a similar feature in "<a href="Adventure%20%28magazine%29">Adventure</a>", the most successful pulp magazine of the day, and the format change may also have been done to increase the resemblance of the two magazines, along with a change to the appearance of "The Thrill Book"'s contents page to resemble that of "Adventure".

Street & Smith cancelled the magazine after the sixteenth issue, dated October 15. A printers' strike has often been suggested as the reason, though Hersey denied it in his reminiscences, and it is clear that poor sales were at least part of the reason for the cancellation. Stories were still being acquired for the magazine by Street & Smith in November, and since the final issue would have appeared on newsstands some time in September, this implies that the magazine went on hiatus (possibly because of the printers' strike) with the expectation of returning, perhaps on a less frequent schedule. A note in Street & Smith's files records the cancellation date as December 1, 1919, which may indicate the point at which the delay caused by the strike convinced Street & Smith to finally kill the magazine.

Hersey began by making himself familiar with the work of writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and <a href="Robert%20W.%20Sneddon">Robert W. Sneddon</a>. Hersey distributed a "Notice to Writers" that described what he was looking for: "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales ... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera ... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let us see it." This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!"

The first issue included "Wolf of the Steppes", a werewolf story by <a href="Greye%20La%20Spina">Greye La Spina</a>. This had been submitted to "<a href="The%20Popular%20Magazine">The Popular Magazine</a>" but purchased by Clancy for "The Thrill Book" in 1918, when Street & Smith began making plans for the new magazine. The story was the first by La Spina, whose real name was Fanny Greye Bragg; she would go on to publish several more stories in "The Thrill Book", and later became a regular contributor to "Weird Tales". Another first story was "The Thing That Wept", by <a href="Fulton%20Oursler">Charles Fulton Oursler</a>, who later went on to edit "<a href="Liberty%20%28general%20interest%20magazine%29">Liberty</a>" and to write novels under the name Anthony Abbot. Two serials were begun in the first issue: "The Jeweled Ibis" by J.C. Kofoed, and "In the Shadows of Race", by J. Hampton Bishop. Both contained enough fantastic or science-fictional elements to fit the original plans for the magazine: "The Jeweled Ibis" was about worshippers of the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">ancient Egyptian gods</a>, and Bishop's story was about a lost race in Africa, and included intelligent apes. The cover for the first issue was by Sidney H. Riesenberg; Bleiler describes it as "shabby and second-rate" by comparison to cover art in successful magazines of the day such as "Adventure" and "Detective Story Magazine". The May 1 issue included an early short story by <a href="Seabury%20Quinn">Seabury Quinn</a>, "The Stone Image", which features a character named Dr. Towbridge, who would later appear (renamed Dr. Trowbridge) in Quinn's popular occult detective stories about <a href="Jules%20de%20Grandin">Jules de Grandin</a>, though Quinn had not yet invented de Grandin. <a href="Tod%20Robbins">Tod Robbins</a>, a well-regarded writer of fantasy, supplied several short pieces, all "shallow mood sketches" without much substance, in the opinion of science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>. The contributors included <a href="Sophie%20Louise%20Wenzel">Sophie Louise Wenzel</a>, who later published stories in Weird Tales under the name Sophie Wenzel Ellis, but most of the writers from Hersey's editorship, such as <a href="George%20C.%20Jenks">George C. Jenks</a> and <a href="John%20R.%20Coryell">John R. Coryell</a>—both authors of dime novels—are no longer well-known names.

When Oliphant took over the editorship, he placed notices in writers' magazines looking for more submissions. Much of the material published under Oliphant's editorship would have been bought by Hersey, making it hard to judge Oliphant's impact. However, it is clear that Oliphant bought more science fiction and fantasy stories than Hersey had done: in particular, Hersey had published almost no stories that were straightforward science fiction, though two he did purchase, Murray Leinster's "A Thousand Degrees Below Zero" and "The Silver Menace", appeared in the first few issues of Oliphant's editorship. Stories such as "The Lost Days" by Trainor Lansing, which dealt with perceptions of time, and "The Ultimate Ingredient" by Greye La Spina, about invisibility, published in August and October respectively, were more evidence of this change in emphasis. The most famous science fiction to appear in "The Thrill Book" was <a href="Francis%20Stevens">Francis Stevens</a>' novel "<a href="The%20Heads%20of%20Cerberus">The Heads of Cerberus</a>", which was one of the earliest fictional depictions of alternate timelines. In addition to increasing the science fiction content, Oliphant also brought in authors who were better known than those published under Hersey's editorship, including <a href="H.%20Bedford-Jones">H. Bedford-Jones</a> and William Wallace Cook. It seems likely that the fiction budget increased when Oliphant took control, and he used this to pay higher word-rates to the better writers. Hersey had paid about a cent per word for fiction, but Bedford-Jones received $800 for "The Opium Ship", which was a rate of between 2.5 and 3 cents per word. However, Francis Stevens was paid only $400, or less than a cent per word, for the much longer novel "The Heads of Cerberus". Poetry continued to appear, including several more poems by Hersey, and also including "Dissonance" by <a href="Clark%20Ashton%20Smith">Clark Ashton Smith</a>, whom Hersey had contacted in March asking for submissions in what Will Murray describes as "a rare instance of Hersey's editorial foresight".
When "The Thrill Book" ceased publication, Street & Smith had numerous manuscripts in inventory that had been purchased for the magazine. These were offered to other Street & Smith magazines such as "Sea Stories" over the next few years. Greye La Spina bought back her manuscript to "The Dead Wagon" in 1927 and re-sold it to "Weird Tales". Francis Stevens had sold three serials and three short stories to "The Thrill Book" that remained unpublished: one of the serials, "Serapion", was published in "Argosy" in 1920, but the fate of the other two is not known—they may have been earlier titles for known works of hers. The three short stories are not known to have been published elsewhere. In 1940, John L. Nanovic, the editor of "<a href="Doc%20Savage%20%28magazine%29">Doc Savage</a>" and "<a href="The%20Shadow%20%28magazine%29">The Shadow</a>", reviewed the remaining "Thrill Book" manuscripts, and suggested to Ralston that a few stories might be publishable in "<a href="Love%20Story%20Magazine">Love Story Magazine</a>", and also suggested a few stories that <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a> might be interested in for "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>". The following year Oliphant reviewed ten of the manuscripts and returned them to Nanovic with his recommendations. Campbell reviewed three of them and declined to take any; he also declined to take Murray Leinster's "The Great Catastrophe", which had been submitted to "The Thrill Book" and found independently of Nanovic's review. Other magazines that considered and rejected the stories Oliphant recommended included "Clues", "Mystery", and "Detective Story Magazine". The only story from "The Thrill Book"'s inventory that was used from this review was Clyde Broadwell's "The Speed Demon's Vendetta", which was rewritten and published in "The Avenger" in March 1942 under the pseudonym "Denby Brixton", which Broadwell had used for a story he had sold to "The Thrill Book".

In 1976 the manuscripts were reviewed again by Will Murray. By this time they had been donated to <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a> by <a href="Cond%C3%A9%20Nast">Condé Nast</a>, which had acquired Street & Smith in 1961. The ten stories reviewed by Oliphant were found and plans were made for Odyssey Publications to publish a paperback edition of "Thrill Book" material including these stories along with some reprints. The following year another group of "Thrill Book" manuscripts was found in the Syracuse collection, including Leinster's "The Great Catastrophe" and La Spina's "The Bracelet", and the planned contents of the anthology were revised to include some of this material. None of the Francis Stevens stories were found in either group of manuscripts. One story, "As It Is Written", by De Lysle Ferree Cass, was misidentified by Murray as the work of Clark Ashton Smith, and this led to delays in publication as Odyssey made separate plans to publish the story under Smith's name. The misidentification was not discovered until after the story appeared in print in 1982. Four years later, Odyssey went out of business, and the anthology of "Thrill Book" material never appeared.

Because "The Thrill Book" was only sold in selected parts of the US, copies of the magazine are very scarce and are highly prized by pulp magazine collectors. Despite its rarity, or perhaps because of it, it has been often described as the first science fiction and fantasy magazine ever published, though more recent assessments by science fiction and pulp historians agree instead that the magazine was a failed attempt at specialization. In the words of Will Murray, the view that "The Thrill Book" is the first such magazine is "erroneously held by many", and he adds that it was "merely a prologue to the Golden Era of periodical weird fiction". In Murray's opinion it might well have become a dominant force in the genre had it continued publication. Richard Bleiler comments that "it was a magazine that somehow became a symbol to a generation of pulp readers ... it was the first eidetic flash of a dream that would later come into being with "Weird Tales"", and in Mike Ashley's opinion it was just "a step towards a full-blown fantasy magazine".

"The Thrill Book" was published by Street & Smith. Initially the magazine was saddle-stapled, in by 8 in, 48 pages long, and priced at 10 cents. This changed with the ninth issue, dated July 1, 1919, to pulp format, with 160 pages, priced at 15 cents. The editor was Harold Hersey from March 1, 1919 to June 15, 1919, and Ronald Oliphant thereafter. There were eight issues to the first volume, six in the second, and two in the third and final volume. Hersey later recalled that he had heard of a "Thrill Book Quarterly" being issued, but no evidence of such a magazine has been found.

Two issues of "The Thrill Book" have been reprinted in facsimile editions, both by <a href="Wildside%20Press">Wildside Press</a>: the September 1, 1919 issue, published in 2005, and the first issue, March 1, 1919, which appeared in 2011.

Lost operas by Claudio Monteverdi

The Italian composer <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Claudio Monteverdi</a> (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of <a href="church%20music">church music</a> and <a href="madrigal">madrigal</a>s, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten <a href="opera">opera</a>s, of which three—"<a href="L%27Orfeo">L'Orfeo</a>" (1607), "<a href="Il%20ritorno%20d%27Ulisse%20in%20patria">Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria</a>" (1640) and "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>" (1643)—have survived with their music and <a href="libretto">libretto</a>s intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists.

Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, "L'Orfeo", written in 1607 for the <a href="House%20of%20Gonzaga">Mantuan court</a>, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as "maestro di cappella" (director of music) at <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a> in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and <a href="intermedi">intermedi</a> (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation.

Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—"<a href="L%27Arianna">L'Arianna</a>", "Andromeda", "Proserpina rapita" and "Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia"—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous <a href="Lament%23Musical%20form">lament</a> from "L'Arianna" and a trio from "Proserpina" are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—"Le nozze di Tetide", "La finta pazza Licori" and "Armida abbandonata"—were abandoned by Monteverdi before completion; how much of their music was actually written is unknown.

Monteverdi's creative life covered more than 50 years. Between 1590 and 1612 he served as a musician in the <a href="House%20of%20Gonzaga">Gonzaga</a> court in Mantua, followed by 30 years (1613–43) as "maestro di capella" at <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a> in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>. This timespan saw opera develop, from its beginnings as a limited form of court entertainment, to become part of the mainstream of public musical theatre. Before the Italian word "opera"—short for "opera in musica" ("musical work")—came into general use around 1634, musical stage works were typically termed "favola in musica" (musical <a href="fable">fable</a>), "dramma in musica" (musical drama), or "tragedia in musica" ("musical <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a>"); Monteverdi used these and similar descriptions for many of his early operatic projects.

The first work now generally considered as an opera is <a href="Jacopo%20Peri">Jacopo Peri</a>'s "<a href="Dafne">Dafne</a>" of 1597, closely followed by "<a href="Euridice%20%28Peri%29">Euridice</a>" (1600), for which Peri and <a href="Giulio%20Caccini">Giulio Caccini</a> wrote separate musical settings. <a href="Ottavio%20Rinuccini">Ottavio Rinuccini</a> was the librettist for both "Dafne" and "Euridice". In the new genre a complete story was told through characters, and in addition to choruses and <a href="Musical%20ensemble%23Musical%20drama">ensembles</a>, the vocal parts included <a href="recitative">recitative</a>, <a href="aria">aria</a> and <a href="arioso">arioso</a>. This was a development from various older forms of musical theatre that had existed since the earliest years of the <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a>; such forms included the "<a href="masque">maschera</a>" ("masque"), the "<a href="ballo">ballo</a>" (a dance entertainment, often with sung passages), and particularly the "<a href="intermedio">intermedio</a>" or "intermezzo", a short dramatic musical episode inserted as a prologue or "<a href="entr%27acte">entr'acte</a>" between the acts of straight plays. Another format in the later renaissance period was the "torneo", or "tournament", a stylised dramatic spectacle in which the main singing was performed by a narrator. Sub-operatic forms of dramatic music continued to thrive as opera itself developed; the blurred boundaries that existed for many years between these forms and "opera" has led to debate about how to categorise some works. For example, the precise genre of Monteverdi's "<a href="Il%20combattimento%20di%20Tancredi%20e%20Clorinda">Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda</a>" (1624) has proved particularly difficult to define.

Monteverdi's first acknowledged opera is "<a href="L%27Orfeo">L'Orfeo</a>" (1607). He composed, in all, 24 works for the stage. Of these, ten are usually classified as operas, of which the music for seven has been lost apart from a few fragments. Most of what is known about the missing works comes from surviving librettos and other documentation, including Monteverdi's own extensive correspondence. <a href="Tim%20Carter%20%28musicologist%29">Tim Carter</a>, a leading Monteverdi scholar, suggests that the high rate of loss is explicable because, in Monteverdi's times, "memories were short and large-scale musical works often had limited currency beyond their immediate circumstances".

Monteverdi wrote six acknowledged operas for the Mantua court, of which only "L'Orfeo" survives with <a href="libretto">libretto</a> and music intact. Four of the five lost Mantuan works were written after the composer had left the service of the Gonzagas in 1612 and was ensconced in Venice, but still retained contacts with Mantua. "L'Arianna" and "Andromeda" were completed and performed; the others were all abandoned incomplete.

"L'Arianna" was composed as a festive piece for the wedding of the heir to the duchy, <a href="Francesco%20IV%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Francesco Gonzaga</a>, to <a href="Margaret%20of%20Savoy%2C%20Vicereine%20of%20Portugal">Margherita of Savoy</a>, in May 1608. Monteverdi received the commission following "L'Orfeo"s successful premiere at the court in February 1607. The libretto for "L'Arianna" was by Rinuccini, whose literary skills had earlier impressed <a href="Vincenzo%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Duke Vincenzo I</a> of Mantua after a performance of "Euridice". The composition of "L'Arianna" became a fraught affair for Monteverdi, being only one of three works that the duke required from him for the wedding—he had also to compose a musical prologue for <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Guarini">Giovanni Battista Guarini</a>'s play "L'idropica", and write the music for a dramatic dance, "<a href="Il%20ballo%20delle%20ingrate">Il ballo delle ingrate</a>". His life had been disrupted by the fatal illness of his wife Claudia; she died on 10 September 1607, but Monteverdi was given no respite by the duke. "L'Arianna" was largely composed in the last two months of 1607, an exertion that Monteverdi's biographer <a href="Hans%20Redlich">Hans Redlich</a> describes as "superhuman". Monteverdi felt slighted by the lack of acknowledgement from the duke for his efforts; nearly 20 years later, in a letter to the Mantua court secretary <a href="Alessandro%20Striggio%20the%20Younger">Alessandro Striggio the Younger</a>, he wrote that he had almost killed himself when writing "L'Arianna" in such a hurry.

Rinuccini used numerous classical sources as the basis for his libretto, in particular works of <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>—the "<a href="Heroides">Heroides</a>" and the "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>"—and poems from <a href="Catullus">Catullus</a>. After a prologue, the main action begins as <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> tells <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a> that <a href="Ariadne">Ariadne</a> and her lover <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a>, fleeing from Crete after his slaying of the <a href="Minotaur">Minotaur</a>, will shortly arrive in <a href="Naxos">Naxos</a>. Theseus, she reports, will then abandon Ariadne, as he believes her to be unacceptable to the people of Athens as their queen. Venus plans to match her instead with the god <a href="Bacchus">Bacchus</a>, and asks Cupid to arrange this. Theseus and Arianna arrive; Theseus agonises over his decision to abandon her, but is advised by his counsellor that he is wise in his resolve, and departs. In the morning Ariadne, finding herself abandoned, searches vainly for Theseus on the shore, where she sings her lament. A <a href="fanfare">fanfare</a> indicates an imminent arrival; Ariadne hopes this is Theseus returning, but it is Bacchus and his entourage. <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> speaks from the heavens, and amid festive scenes Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality with the gods in return for her love.

Rinuccini extended the libretto during the rehearsals, after complaints from the duchess that the piece was "too dry"; as a result the early scene between Venus and Cupid, and Jupiter's blessing from heaven, were added. Preparations for the opera's performance were disrupted when, in March 1608, the leading <a href="soprano">soprano</a> Caterina Martinelli died of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. A replacement had to be found rapidly, and the title role fell to Virginia Andreidi, a renowned actress-singer who used the stage name "La Florinda"; she reportedly learned the part in only six days. In his analysis of Monteverdi's theatrical works, Carter suggests that the lament may have been added to the work to make the most of Andreini's acting and vocal abilities. The premiere, on 28 May 1608, was staged in a specially erected temporary theatre, which according to contemporary reports could hold an audience of several thousands. The production was lavish; apparently 300 men were required to manipulate the stage machinery. Federico Follino, who prepared the Mantuan court's official report on the occasion, praised the beauty of the work, the magnificence of costumes and machinery, and the sweetness of the music. Monteverdi's fellow-composer <a href="Marco%20da%20Gagliano">Marco da Gagliano</a> was equally complimentary, writing that the opera had "visibly moved the entire audience to tears." It is possible that "L'Arianna" was performed in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> in 1614; a projected performance in Mantua in May 1620 to celebrate <a href="Catherine%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Governor%20of%20Siena">Duchess Caterina</a>'s birthday was cancelled for unknown reasons. Otherwise, there are no records of the opera's performance before its revival in 1640 at the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Mois%C3%A8">Teatro San Moisè</a>, Venice. In his study of late Renaissance opera, Gary Tomlinson surmises that the work's enthusiastic reception in Venice was a significant factor in Monteverdi's decision to resume opera composition during his final years.

Of the music, only the lament survives. It was published independently from the opera in various forms; an adaptation for five voices was included in Monteverdi's Sixth Book of Madrigals in 1614, and two versions of the original solo were published in 1623. Other composers emulated the lament's format; Redlich asserts that it initiated a musical subgenre that lasted to the end of the 17th century and beyond. The libretto has been preserved; versions were published in Mantua in 1608, and in Venice in 1622 and 1639.

After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother <a href="Ferdinando%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Ferdinando</a>, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed "maestro di capella" in August 1613 at <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's</a>, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto "Le nozze di Tetide", as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to <a href="Catherine%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Governor%20of%20Siena">Catherine de' Medici</a>. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a> to the sea-goddess <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a>, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of "L'Arianna".

Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for "Le nozze di Tetide", and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve <a href="mass%20%28music%29">mass</a> for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on "Le Nozze di Tetide" "if you tell me to do so". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of <a href="intermedio">intermedi</a>. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought fully appropriate to the occasion. He began work on the <a href="recitative">recitative</a> sections, but before he could start setting the more expressive numbers, the duke had a change of heart and cancelled Monteverdi's commission. "Le nozze di Tetide" was abandoned; its libretto and whatever music existed have disappeared.

Monteverdi's next commission from Mantua came early in 1618, when he was asked to provide the music for "Andromeda", an opera based on <a href="Andromeda%20%28mythology%29">the ancient Greek myth</a> of the princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, <a href="Ercole%20Marigliani">Ercole Marigliani</a>, and the project was sponsored by the duke's younger brother, <a href="Vincenzo%20II%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Don Vincenzo Gonzaga</a>. It is probable that the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on "Andromeda" delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.

Monteverdi's letters during the 1618–20 period, mainly to Striggio but occasionally to Don Vincenzo or Marigliani, offer various excuses for his lack of progress on "Andromeda", including his duties at St Mark's, his health, and his obligations to provide ceremonial music for the <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge</a> (ruler) of Venice. In February 1619, Monteverdi had started work on another Mantuan project, a "<a href="ballo">ballo</a>" (dance with sung parts) to Striggio's libretto entitled "Apollo". On 9 January 1620, still with 400 lines of the "Andromeda" libretto to set to music, Monteverdi proposed to Striggio that the entire opera project be abandoned and the "ballo" substituted. This idea was rapidly quashed; Don Vincenzo ordered that the remaining "Andromeda" music be sent to him forthwith. The final segment of "Andromeda", an eight-part song, was delivered to Marigliani on 15 February 1620.

None of Monteverdi's music for "Andromeda" has survived. The libretto was also thought to have been lost, until its rediscovery in 1984. As was customary in Monteverdi's time, the manuscript makes no mention of the composer's name—librettos were often the subject of numerous settings by different composers. The libretto's frontispiece confirms that "Andromeda" was performed during Mantua's Carnival, 1–3 March 1620. An analysis of its contents reveals some influence from Rinuccini's libretto for "Arianna", such as use of identical metre and length in the prologues of each work, and several common characters in the respective cast lists. The document remains in private hands and has not been published.

Monteverdi recorded no apparent interest in the performance of "Andromeda" after the 1620 Carnival; the long letter that he wrote to Striggio on 13 March 1620 makes no reference to the event and is chiefly concerned with financial matters. The letter implies that the Gonzaga court was trying to persuade Monteverdi to return to Mantua; in courtly language Monteverdi evades the issue, while comparing the relative generosity of his Venetian employers with the parsimony of the Gonzaga court.

After "Andromeda" there followed a period of several years in which Mantua made little use of Monteverdi's services. Duke Ferdinando died on 26 October 1626 and was succeeded by Don Vincenzo, who became Duke Vincenzo II. Early in 1627 Striggio approached Monteverdi with a request for theatrical music, possibly for the festivities that would celebrate Vincenzo's accession. Monteverdi replied offering three options: first, "Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda" ("The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda"), a setting from <a href="Torquato%20Tasso">Torquato Tasso</a>'s epic poem "<a href="Jerusalem%20Delivered">Gerusalemme liberata</a>" ("Jerusalem Delivered"), which had been performed at the 1624 Venice Carnival; secondly, a setting from another part of Tasso's poem, covering the story of the sorceress Armida and her abandonment by the Christian hero Rinaldo; finally, he offered to set the words of a new play by <a href="Giulio%20Strozzi">Giulio Strozzi</a>, "Licori finta pazza inamorata d'Aminta", about a woman who feigns madness for the sake of love. Monteverdi sent Striggio a copy of Strozzi's play on 7 May 1627; Striggio liked it and instructed Monteverdi to begin the music.

Strozzi was a Venetian, born in 1583, whose literary works included plays and poetry as well as opera libretti; Monteverdi had first met him in 1621. Strozzi knew Monteverdi's music, and had developed a strong appreciation of the composer's innovative style. On 20 June 1627, Monteverdi informed Striggio that Strozzi had expanded and arranged the text into five acts, under the new title "La finta pazza Licori". Feigned madness was a standard theme in the "<a href="commedia%20dell%27arte">commedia dell'arte</a>" tradition that had established itself in Italian theatre in the 16th century. In Strozzi's plot, the first known attempt at comic opera, the woman Licori disguises herself initially as a man, then as a woman, and then pretends to be mad, all as part of a strategy to win the heart of her lover, Aminta.

Monteverdi was, at least initially, much taken with the potential of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability to play the role of Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions and gestures. Later he enthused about the chance to write a <a href="Ballet%23History">ballet</a> for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but his attitude slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, in his analysis of the opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled the commission and the work is heard of no more. Monteverdi was told instead to work on the "Armida" setting.

For many years it was assumed that Monteverdi had written much of the music for "Licori" before its sudden cancellation; Redlich says the music was finished by 10 September 1627. The work's rejection and subsequent disappearance have been blamed on Striggio's disregard for Monteverdi's efforts. However, Tomlinson's reading of the correspondence suggests a different conclusion: Monteverdi, in his view, "did not even come close to completing the score" and may have written very little of the music. It is likely that he stopped composing at the end of July, having become suspicious of Striggio's true commitment to the work. Tomlinson suggests that, mindful of Mantua's earlier cancellation of "Le nozze di Tetide", Monteverdi avoided extending himself on the new project, while maintaining a diplomatic impression of activity. Tomlinson writes: "[I]t would hardly be surprising if Monteverdi were preternaturally sensitive to signs of Mantuan vacillation [and] if, at the first such signs in 1627, he decided to move cautiously in the composition of "Licori"." Strozzi's libretto has vanished along with whatever music Monteverdi managed to write, but Strozzi wrote a second libretto under the same name, which was set by <a href="Francesco%20Sacrati">Francesco Sacrati</a> and produced in Venice in 1641.

After the rejection of "Licori", Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to "Armida". Instead, he went to <a href="Parma">Parma</a>, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful <a href="Odoardo%20Farnese%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma">Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma</a> and <a href="Margherita%20de%27%20Medici">Margherita de' Medici</a>. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for "Armida" had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.

Carter indicates several structural similarities to "Il combattimento"; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, "Armida abbandonata", unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a "parergon" (subsidiary work) to "Il Combattimento".

Plans for "Armida"s performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of "Armida", perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the "<a href="stile%20concitato">stile concitato</a>" effect. Although there is no record that "Armida" was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy patron of the arts at whose Venetian palace "Il combattimento" had been performed in 1624.

"Licori" and "Armida" were Monteverdi's final theatrical works for the Mantuan court. Vincenzo II's death ended the main Gonzaga line; the dukedom was inherited by a distant relative, <a href="Charles%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua%20and%20Montferrat">Charles of Nevers</a>, and Mantua was subsequently engulfed in a series of conflicts, which by 1630 had reduced much of the city to ruins. Monteverdi's last known letter to Striggio is dated 8 July 1628; Striggio died in Venice on 8 June 1630, while heading a mission requesting aid against the armies that were encircling Mantua.

Between 1630 and 1643 Monteverdi wrote four operas for performance in Venice. All were staged in Monteverdi's lifetime, but only "<a href="Il%20ritorno%20d%27Ulisse%20in%20patria">Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria</a>" and "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>" survive.

"Proserpina rapita" was the first of the theatrical works that Monteverdi wrote specifically for Venice, under a commission from Mocenigo for his daughter Giustiniana's wedding celebrations. The libretto, by Strozzi, is based on the ancient Greek myth of <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a> and <a href="Proserpina">Proserpine</a>. Symbolic rape was a common theme in wedding entertainments designed for Italian courts, intended in Carter's words "both to proclaim the power of love and to set proper bounds on female behaviour".
In Strozzi's version of the story, an amorous shepherd Pachino invokes the aid of Pluto, ruler of <a href="Hades%23Realm%20of%20Hades">the underworld</a>, to cure his unrequited obsession with Proserpine. Pluto obliges by turning Pachino into a mountain, though promising his soul a place in <a href="Elysium">Elysium</a>. After being struck by a love-dart fired by <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a>, Pluto falls for Proserpine and claims her as his queen. Initially she resists him, but when <a href="Cyane">Ciane</a> her protector is turned by Pluto into a spring of water, she is overcome. Submissively, she vows obedience; the strength of her beauty is such that Pluto softens, and pledges that in future he will treat lovers less harshly.

The libretto was published in 1630, in Venice, by Evangelista Deuchino. Surviving copies indicate that the original scenery was created by Giuseppe Albardi, and that dances were arranged by Girolamo Scolari. The opera was staged on 16 April 1630, in a salon of the Mocenigo palace. Carter is sceptical that, in such a restricted venue, the performance could have incorporated all the special effects stipulated by the libretto. Nevertheless, an account by one of those present shows that the occasion provided considerable spectacle: "[I]n the evening with torches there was acted and represented in music ... the Rape of Proserpina with most perfect voices and instruments, with aerial apparitions, scene changes and other things, to the astonishment and wonder of all present."

One small fragment of the music for "Proserpina rapita" survives, a song for three voices: "Come dolce oggi l'auretta". This was published posthumously in Monteverdi's ninth Madrigal Book ("Madrigali e Canzonette a due e tre voci") (1651). Otherwise, some indication of the musical character of the work is discernible from notes in the libretto, which Fabbri suggests, indicate that the work may not have been sung throughout. The work contained at least two sung "<a href="ballo">balli</a>", one of which concluded the opera with words that provided a thinly disguised tribute to the composer: "Quanto nel chiaro mondo / su "verdi" arcadi "monti" / di te si cantari?" ("How much in the clear world / on green Arcadian mountains / will be sung of you?"). More information about the nature of the music and the instrumentation is included in notes within the published libretto.

According to Carter, "Proserpina rapita" is a transitional work. With its emphasis on dance, and in terms of its subject-matter, it represents the courtly traditions of early 17th century opera. At the same time, in terms of characterisation it looks forward to the "modern" world of Monteverdi's trio of late operas, specifically to "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>". Proserpina's temperament anticipates the character Poppea in the later opera; likewise Pachino may be a forerunner for Ottone, while some of the discourses in "Proserpina" have the rhetorical flavour of those between Nerone and Seneca in "L'incoronazione". Redlich records that in 1644, the year following Monteverdi's death, "Proserpina rapita" was added to the repertory of Venice's <a href="Teatro%20San%20Mois%C3%A8">Teatro San Moisè</a>, but he provides no details of performances. A second edition of the libretto was published in Venice in that year.

In the three years before his death in 1643, Monteverdi composed a trilogy of operas for the Venetian opera theatres following the opening in 1637 of the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Cassiano">Teatro San Cassiano</a>. Two of these three operas survive in complete, performable versions: "<a href="Il%20ritorno%20d%27Ulisse%20in%20patria">Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria</a>" (1640), to a libretto by <a href="Giacomo%20Badoaro">Giacomo Badoaro</a>, and "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>" (1643) for which <a href="Giovanni%20Francesco%20Busenello">Giovanni Francesco Busenello</a> provided the text. Between these, Monteverdi composed "Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia"; the libretto survives in manuscript form, though no trace of the music has been found. In her analysis of Monteverdi's late works, <a href="Ellen%20Rosand">Ellen Rosand</a> links the three operas together: "[The] ghost opera joins with the two survivors to form a coherent body of works that attests to Monteverdi's position within the world of Venetian opera." The trilogy encompasses a historical trajectory that moves through Troy and the birth of Rome to the decline of the Roman Empire, and points forward to the foundation and ultimate glory of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian Republic</a>. The common theme of the three works is the mythical power of love, at first beneficial but later destructive.
Because of textual and structural similarities with "Ulisse", it was once assumed that Badoaro had written the "Le nozze" libretto. However, Rosand's researches reveal the librettist to be a close friend of Badoaro's, Michelangelo Torcigliani. In a lengthy preface Torcigliani introduces his story, taken from <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s epic "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>", as a "tragedia di lieto fine" (tragedy with a happy ending). He acknowledges numerous departures from the original, including the introduction of a comic character, "Numanus". This was done, he admitted, because "Iro", an analogous character type in "Ulisse", had proved popular with theatregoers. The text had been written to meet Monteverdi's requirements for emotional variety, thus enabling him, said Torcigliani, to demonstrate the full range of his musical genius.

The principal theme of the story is the desire by <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a>, who is feuding with <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a>'s mother <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> to prevent the marriage of the Trojan Aeneas to <a href="Lavinia">Lavinia</a>, daughter of King Latino of <a href="Latium">Latium</a>. She uses an evil spirit to provoke disharmony between Trojans and Latins; when a Trojan hunting party first wounds a deer and then kills a Latin shepherd, Elminio, there are calls for war, which Latino rejects. Aeneas, resting by the River Tiber, is unaware of these troubling incidents, though he is warned by the spirit of the river. Danger arrives in the person of <a href="Turnus">Turnus</a>, King of the <a href="Rutuli">Rutuli</a>, an ally of the Latins whose love Lavinia has rejected. Spurred on by Turnus's clamour for war, Trojans and Latins fight, and Aeneas kills Turnus. Latino invites Aeneas to take the hand of Lavinia, who is delighted to accept him. In the light of Aeneas's bravery, Juno forgets her former enmity, and joins with Venus and <a href="Hymen%20%28god%29">Hymen</a> to bless the marriage. The opera ends with predictions of the greatness of Rome and the distant future glories of Venice.

"Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia" was performed during the Venice Carnival of 1640–41, at the <a href="Teatro%20Santi%20Giovanni%20e%20Paolo">Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo</a> where it alternated with a revival of "Ulisse". According to Carter the work was fairly undemanding in terms of its staging, the action taking place mainly on the banks of the Tiber with few changes of set. There is no record of the Venetian public's response to the opera that, Rosand asserts, was clearly aimed at their patriotic impulses, with its final scene a celebration of "the birth and marvels of the city of Venice". In a preface published with the libretto, Torcigliani refers to "the sweetness of the music of the never-enough praised Monteverde", but the libretto itself provides no specific guides to the music's nature. Ringer records with regret that "[t]he words are all that remain of this Virgilian opera, offering faint hints of lost melodies".

Many of Monteverdi's lost works date from the 1610s and 1620s, and the manuscripts may have disappeared in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Mantuan%20Succession">wars that overcame Mantua in 1630</a>. Carter cites as a significant aspect of their loss the degree to which they might have provided musical links between the composer's early Mantuan court operas and the public operas he wrote in Venice towards the end of his life: "Without these links ... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage". In an essay on the opera orchestras of Montverdi's day, <a href="Janet%20Beat">Janet Beat</a> regrets that the 30-year gap between "L'Orfeo" and the next Monteverdi opera to have survived, "<a href="Il%20ritorno%20d%27Ulisse%20in%20patria">Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria</a>", hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical years.

Carter also reflects on the intriguing possibility, however remote, that a discovery in an unexplored library might one day bring some of this missing music to light. As of 2015 this has not occurred; however, a setting of Rinuccini's libretto by the British composer <a href="Alexander%20Goehr">Alexander Goehr</a> was performed at London's <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> on 15 September 1995, under the title "<a href="Arianna%20%28Goehr%29">Arianna</a>". Goehr worked from Rinuccini's original script and, as a tribute to the historic opera, incorporated sections of Monteverdi's setting of the lament into his score.

Flotilla (video game)

Flotilla is a 2010 <a href="turn-based%20strategy">turn-based strategy</a> space combat <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by Brendon Chung's studio, <a href="Blendo%20Games">Blendo Games</a>. The game was released in March 2010 on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and on <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live Indie Games</a> for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>. "Flotilla" was designed with Microsoft's <a href="Microsoft%20XNA">XNA</a> tools, and its development was influenced by animals as well as board games such as "<a href="Axis%20and%20Allies">Axis and Allies</a>" and "<a href="Arkham%20Horror">Arkham Horror</a>". The game takes the player in an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy.

Chung began developing "Flotilla" immediately after the closure of <a href="Pandemic%20Studios">Pandemic Studios</a>, where he had worked as a designer. The new game used assets imported from Chung's early space combat prototype, "Space Piñata". "Flotilla" incorporates several pieces of classical music in its score, such as <a href="Chopin">Chopin</a>'s <a href="Prelude%2C%20Op.%2028%2C%20No.%2015%20%28Chopin%29">"Raindrop" prelude</a>. It received mixed reviews from <a href="Video%20game%20journalism">video game media outlets</a>, scoring 72 out of 100 on review aggregate website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, and was included in Mike Rose's book "250 Indie Games You Must Play".

"Flotilla" is a three-dimensional simultaneous <a href="turn-based%20strategy">turn-based strategy</a> space combat video game set in a randomly generated galaxy. The player and <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">computer-controlled</a> opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion over a period of 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move and focus fire. An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.

At the beginning of the game, the player is usually given two ships to control, but more become available as the game continues. Ships may be rotated arbitrarily in any direction. The <a href="single-player">single-player</a> mode is an "adventure" that can be played an indefinite number of times. These adventures have a duration of around 30 minutes. The character dies at the end of each adventure and the player is given the option to play again. A hardcore mode, which removes the solo mode's standard 30-minute time limit, was later added to the game. Each time the player starts a new adventure, a new galaxy is randomly generated and filled with planets and enemy ships. The player may take a short tutorial before beginning the adventure.

Each planet offers a possible quest or challenge to the player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter is added to the player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. "Flotilla" has <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative</a> and <a href="split-screen%20multiplayer">split-screen multiplayer</a> modes that can be played with an additional <a href="Xbox%20360%20controller">Xbox 360 controller</a>.

"Flotilla" was developed by Brendon Chung's video game studio, <a href="Blendo%20Games">Blendo Games</a>. Chung, who worked as a <a href="level%20designer">level designer</a> for <a href="Pandemic%20Studios">Pandemic Studios</a>, previously contributed to the development of "<a href="Full%20Spectrum%20Warrior">Full Spectrum Warrior</a>" (2004) and "" (2009). Chung started coding "Flotilla" in 2009 after <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> closed Pandemic Studios. He was excited at the time of the studio's closure, and stated that "there was adrenaline pumping through my veins". The game was developed using <a href="Microsoft%20XNA">Microsoft XNA</a>, a set of game development tools created by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>.

The concept of "Flotilla" came from a combination of "sci-fi like "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" and submarine movies". Chung explained that he "figured there was enough games about little fighter jets", and that what he had in mind was "a jumbo battleship floating in space". Animals, instead of aliens, are featured as characters in the game. Chung explained that he did so because "any fantastical creature design I came up with would pale in comparison to already-existing designs made by other people." Therefore, instead of trying to solve the problem of creating compelling alien characters, he switched to animals: "[they] have certain built-in characteristics, they were fairly unique in how they weren't typically associated with space adventures." In an interview with <a href="SquareGo">SquareGo</a>, Chung revealed that board games such as "<a href="Axis%20and%20Allies">Axis and Allies</a>" and "<a href="Arkham%20Horror">Arkham Horror</a>" had an influential role in the game's development process.

Before "Flotilla", Chung worked on a prototype, a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> turn-based space action game called "Space Piñata", whose gameplay and structure were similar to those of the final version of "Flotilla". Chung intentionally limited the solo mode's play time as an "experiment in making a short-story generator", such that an adventure could begin and end within a half hour. Following negative response, a patch was deployed to change this limitation. The patch included a new "hardcore" mode. "Flotilla" score incorporates several pieces of classical music, such as <a href="Chopin">Chopin</a>'s <a href="Prelude%2C%20Op.%2028%2C%20No.%2015%20%28Chopin%29">"Raindrop" prelude</a>. According to "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" magazine, the "Raindrop" prelude gives the game's battles "an emotional undercurrent". Chung said that the soundtrack was designed to give the game "a tragic feel" and that he wanted the game to be portrayed as "the anti-testosterone-fueled" action game.

"Flotilla" received a mixed response from <a href="Video%20game%20journalism">video game journalists</a> upon release. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game received an average score of 72 based on 7 reviews. British magazine "Edge" included "Flotilla" in its 2010 list of the Best 20 Indie Games available in the Xbox Live Marketplace, and acknowledged that the game was "as exacting as it is quirky, a stiff challenge beneath a sugar coating." Mike Rose included "Flotilla" in his book "250 Indie Games You Must Play".

The American version of "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" commented that "Flotilla" "is a charmingly crafted bite-size portion of tactical fun". Meanwhile, the British version of the magazine elaborated that although the game had its share of "charm and character," it was nonetheless a random experience. "PC Zone UK" characterized "Flotilla" as stylish and funny, but concluded that it was a "sadly disposable" experience. "Edge" gave a mixed response to the game, but praised the battles, which they considered "engaging despite their simplicity." An editor from website "Charge Shot" praised the game's <a href="AI">artificial intelligence</a> and overall design, but criticized the multiplayer mode.

Joe Martin from Bit-Tech named "Flotilla" a "hilarious and brazenly original" game. However, he criticized the interface and navigation gameplay, which he condemned as "trying to pilot a radio-controlled helicopter with someone else's feet." He also mentioned the lack of a speed-up feature in battles; he considered such a feature necessary for the game. "GameZone" Tom Dann also felt frustrated by the ship maneuvering mechanics, though he concluded that they "can also be rewarding and entertaining". "Flotilla" was nominated for the 2011 <a href="Independent%20Games%20Festival">Independent Games Festival</a> Visions Award, but lost to "". It was also listed among the Honorable Mentions for the Excellence in Visual Art and Excellence in Design awards.

Blendo Games announced "Flotlla 2" in April 2018, with an expected release date of August 1, 2018. The sequel is designed for <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> hardward and initially exclusive to the <a href="HTC%20Vive">HTC Vive</a> headset; the virtual reality aspect will allow players to move around the space environment to plan out their tactics.

Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele

The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele is a large oil-on-oak panel painting completed around 1434–36 by the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>. It shows the painting's <a href="Donor%20portrait">donor</a>, <a href="Joris%20van%20der%20Paele">Joris van der Paele</a>, within an apparition of saints. The <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a> is enthroned at the centre of the semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the <a href="Christ%20Child">Christ Child</a> on her lap. <a href="Saint%20Donatian">St. Donatian</a> stands to her right, <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> — the donor's name saint — to her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>. He was then a wealthy clergyman from <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.

The saints are identifiable from Latin inscriptions lining the borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is identifiable from historical records. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white <a href="surplice">surplice</a>, as he piously reads from a <a href="book%20of%20hours">book of hours</a>. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. <a href="Saint%20Donatian">Saint Donatian</a>, dressed in brightly coloured <a href="vestments">vestments</a>, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious <a href="iconography">iconography</a>. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve</a>, prefigurations of the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion</a> and <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">Resurrection of Jesus</a>, and scenes from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature.

The "van der Paele" panel is widely considered one of van Eyck's most fully realised and ambitious works, and has been described as a "masterpiece of masterpieces".

Van der Paele is identifiable both from his resemblance and by the paternal and maternal (the Carlans') coat of arms at the corners of each frame. He was born in Bruges around 1370, and spent his early career as a papal scribe in Rome before returning to his native city in 1425 as a wealthy man. He was appointed to a <a href="canonry">canonry</a> of <a href="St.%20Donatian%27s%20Cathedral">St. Donatian's collegiate church</a>, a position which gave him income from the various parishes under his remit.

An illness around 1431 left van der Paele unable to fulfil the functions of his office, and led him to reflect upon his position as canon and on his mortality. In response he endowed a <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a>cy to the church and commissioned this work from van Eyck. The artist was at the height of his fame and in high demand, and this, along with the large size of the panel, meant that the commission took a lot longer to complete than was initially envisioned; two completion dates can be found on the frame, implying that the earlier date was aspirational and missed.

In return for the bequest, the church granted the canon a <a href="requiem%20mass">requiem mass</a>, a daily mass and three <a href="votive">votive</a> masses a week, meant to intercede with the divine on his behalf. A second chaplaincy in 1443 centred on prayers for his family, and guaranteed that after his death, the requiem mass would end with readings of the <a href="Psalm%2051">Miserere mei</a> and <a href="Psalm%20130">De profundis</a>.
Van der Paele may have kept the panel in his private chambers or as a church altar. He donated it to the church either in 1436 or on his death in 1443; it remained there until the church was demolished in 1779. Most likely the work was situated in the <a href="nave">nave</a> as an accompaniment to an altar for Saints <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a> and <a href="Saint%20Paul">Paul</a> and used for memorial masses for van der Paele and his family. It was installed on the main altar after the <a href="Beeldenstorm">Iconoclasm of 1566</a>.

An inscription on the lower imitation frame refers to der Paele's <a href="benefactor%20%28law%29">benefaction</a>: "Joris van der Paele, canon of this church, had this work made by painter Jan van Eyck. And he founded two chaplaincies here in the choir of the Lord. 2025. He only completed it in 1436, however."

The "Virgin and Child" is set in a rounded church with side <a href="ambulatory">ambulatories</a>, with Mary occupying the area where the altarpiece would usually be positioned. The panel has an overall sculptural look; the throne, windows, arches and hanging canvases borrow from the conventions of <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque architecture</a>. After the "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb" panel of the "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>", it is van Eyck's second largest extant painting, and the only one in a horizontal framing. The "Virgin and Child" is characterised by its innovative use of <a href="illusionism">illusionism</a> and complex spatial composition. It is in its original oak frame, which contains several Latin inscriptions, including van Eyck's signature, the date of completion, the donor's name, and texts related to St. George and St. Donatian. The upper border contains phrases from the <a href="Book%20of%20Wisdom">Book of Wisdom</a>, comparing Mary to an "unspotted mirror".

The figures, the minutely detailed clothes, and the architecture of the room and windows are depicted with a high degree of realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered <a href="cope">cope</a> and <a href="mitre">mitre</a>, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.

As with van Eyck's "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Chancellor%20Rolin">Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</a>", the panel creates an intimate setting between the donor and Virgin. This is emphasised by the donor's physical proximity to the Virgin which, according to art historian <a href="Jeffrey%20Chipps%20Smith">Jeffrey Chipps Smith</a>, "mentally and pictorially [breaches] the barriers between heaven and earth" and implies the "patrons are visually immortalized as meriting the Virgin and Child's personal attention." The intimacy is further enhanced by small details such as the overlap between the donor and Saint George, who casts a shadow on van der Paele and seems to have accidentally stepped on his <a href="surplice">surplice</a> as he leans forward to introduce the canon to the Virgin.

St. Donatian is positioned to the left of the Virgin, the more significant position in heraldic terms, and reflective of his status as dedicatee of the cathedral the painting was made for, and of the city of Bruges. He wears a <a href="cope">cope</a> and <a href="mitre">mitre</a>, vestments found in contemporary inventories of the church. His blue and gold <a href="brocade">brocade</a> cope is embroidered with images of <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">St. Paul</a> and <a href="Saint%20Peter">St. Peter</a>. The colouring of his vestments is very similar to those of the Archangel in van Eyck's "<a href="Dresden%20Triptych">Dresden Triptych</a>" of 1437.

Donatian stands in front of a set of windows that are just outside the pictorial space. He holds a jewelled <a href="processional%20cross">processional cross</a> in his left hand, and a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right. The wheel is his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a>, but was saved after <a href="Pope%20Dionysius">Pope Dionysius</a> threw him a carriage wheel he was able to use as a float.

The panel is one of the earliest known <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">northern European</a> "<a href="sacra%20conversazione">sacra conversazione</a>" (the Virgin and Child shown with a group of saints in a relatively informal grouping) paintings. The Virgin sits on an elevated throne, situated beneath a minutely detailed and extravagantly decorated brocade <a href="baldachin">baldachin</a> containing white rose patterns, symbolising her purity. Given the church setting, Mary occupies the area where the altarpiece would usually be. The steps leading to the throne are covered with an <a href="Oriental%20carpets%20in%20Renaissance%20painting">oriental carpet</a>. Her idealised facial type (and that of St. George) is very similar to the Virgin in van Eyck's Washington "<a href="Annunciation%20%28van%20Eyck%2C%20Washington%29">Annunciation</a>".

Although the Madonna's throne is in the mid-ground, her head is level with the standing figures in the foreground, who are closer in <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>. The <a href="apse">apse</a> in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach can be seen in the later "Dresden Triptych", but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in "Canon van der Paele" are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.

The Child has curly blond hair and sits on a white cloth, animated and upright, at the side of the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this <a href="Overpainting">overpaint</a> was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the <a href="Sacramental%20bread">host</a> and <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, common allusions in <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish art</a> and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.

St. George stands in lavishly decorated armour, and appears relaxed and nonchalant, raising his helmet and left hand to introduce van der Paele. The saint was the donor's name saint and St. Donatian's Cathedral was built (c. 950 AD) to house a <a href="relic">relic</a> of one of his arm bones. George's armour is similar to that of St. Michael in van Eyck's "<a href="Dresden%20Triptych">Dresden Triptych</a>", while his steel shield resembles those in the "Knights of Christ" panel of the Ghent altarpiece.

Art historian <a href="Max%20Jakob%20Friedl%C3%A4nder">Max Jakob Friedländer</a> notes how St. George seems hesitant and unsure of himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. He has a very young face, and seems barely in his teens, with a gawky face, which according to Friedländer "forms a strange contrast to the aged, ponderous canon". George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet while simultaneously presenting the donor, and "this seems to embarrass him". George is the only figure whose feet are exposed. The uncertain manner in which he gestures to the Virgin gives the impression of a shy and uncertain nature; and he raises his helmet in a hesitant manner. Friedländer observes that George's head is slightly inclined, his face "twisted into an empty smile".
The Virgin and Child can be seen in the reflection of George's helmet. Van Eyck alludes to his own artistry by including his self portrait as a reflection on the knight's shield. The artist depicts himself standing at his easel, in a manner that strongly resembles the self-portrait reflected in the mirror in his "Arnolfini Portrait".

In both that work and here, he shows himself wearing a red turban similar to that seen in the possible self-portrait "<a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Man%20%28Self%20Portrait%3F%29">Portrait of a Man</a>", of 1433.

The painting marks a departure from conventional and contemporary European epitaphs by placing the saints and mortal donor within the same pictorial space. Van der Paele kneels to the right of the Virgin and Child and seems a somewhat distracted and absent-minded figure. This is intentional, an indication that he is, in the words of art historian Bret Rothstein, "disconnected from the perceptible world", and fully absorbed in the spiritual realm. This notion is reinforced by his glasses which, although they imply education, wealth and learning, also allude to fallibility of the human, earthly senses. In keeping with the conventions of late medieval art, van der Paele does not look directly at any of the heavenly figures, but stares into the middle distance, observing social and spiritual decorum.

Van Eyck does not shy from showing the physical effects of the canon's illness, including worn, crevassed and tired skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries and swollen fingers. The awkwardness with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, borne out by early 1430s church records documenting that he was excused from morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly <a href="polymyalgia%20rheumatica">polymyalgia rheumatica</a> and <a href="Giant-cell%20arteritis">temporal arteritis</a>.

"Virgin and Child" is rich with seamlessly woven iconography. Broadly, the elements on the left, including the imitation carvings, reference Christ's death, and those on the right his Resurrection. The painting contains examples of van Eyck's habit of presenting the viewer with what art historian <a href="Craig%20Harbison">Craig Harbison</a> describes as "a transfigured view of visible reality", via the placement of small, unobtrusive, details which "illustrated not earthly existence but what [van Eyck] considered supernatural truth. They would have been easy to discern for a medieval viewer".

The figures are in a church, surrounded by an arcade of semi-circular arches, which suggests it might be a <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a>. The scene seems to be illuminated from invisible windows, with light spilling from the left foreground and the leaded windows behind the Virgin's throne. Mary's throne is placed where the altar would normally be positioned. The Child's white cloth is draped over Mary's red robe, which may represent veiled host during celebration of the Eucharist; a reference to Christ's <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">death and resurrection</a>.

The churches in van Eyck's work are not based on historical buildings, but were amalgams of different buildings and fictitious spaces. The church might resemble St. Donatian's, which has since been demolished; it seems to share similarities with the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a> in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, with elements of Romanesque architecture. Van Eyck's paintings are often spatially ambiguous; the more the viewer looks at them the more questions are raised. Reflecting a consensus among art historians, Ward interprets the contradictions as "either curiously incoherent or deliberately designed to enact a complex symbolic message." Mary holds a stem that appears to grow from the parrot's feathers, culminating in a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers. A parrot was sometimes used as an emblem for the Virgin, but its juxtaposition with the plant is incongruous. The parrot and plant emphasise the floral background, symbolising the Garden of Eden, accented by the figures of Adam of Eve. The flowers' colours represent purity, love and humility; its petals are a symbol of the cross and Christ's sacrifice. The narrative of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>, the expulsion and <a href="redemption%20%28theology%29">redemption</a> is thus captured in a single realistic device.

The carved representations of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve</a> appear on the uprights of the throne. The capitals on the arms of the throne show <a href="Cain%20and%20Abel%23Cain">Cain</a> beating <a href="Cain%20and%20Abel%23Abel">Abel</a> to death with a club to Mary's left, and Samson opening the lion's jaws to her left. The carvings on the architectural capitals depict Old Testament scenes, including the meeting of <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a> and <a href="Melchizedek">Melchizedek</a> and the <a href="Sacrifice%20of%20Isaac">Sacrifice of Isaac</a>.

The panel is made from six horizontal boards linked by <a href="Butt%20joint">butt joins</a> reinforced with a <a href="dowel">cylindrical rod</a>, with the joins glued with plant fibres. The reverse is not painted, indicating it was intended to hang against a wall. The frame comprises a main frame nailed and screwed at the side to two outer parts. The borders do not show signs of having hinges, indicating that the work was meant as a stand-alone panel, and not as part of a triptych. The corners are assembled with mortise and tenon. Each corner is reinforced by two pegs. The boards were originally painted a uniform brown, and were degraded by gloss and overprint over the centuries. Following a series of restorations, mainly by Jef Van der Veken in 1933-34 and Edmond Florens in 1977, they are in good condition. The inscriptions were placed on flat strips between the <a href="Molding%20%28process%29">mouldings</a>.

The frame is richly inscribed, with van Eyck's signature, the coats of arms of both Van der Paele's paternal and maternal families (the Carlins), lettering identifying each of the two attendant saints, and a passage praising the Virgin. The inscriptions are painted in an illusionistic manner. Those on the lower border appear to be in raised cast brass lettering, those on the order borders appear to have been cut into the frame's timber.

The inscription on the frame beside St. Donatian reads ("He was the youngest of nine brothers; thrown into the water, he returned to life and became the first archbishop of Reims. He enjoys now the glory of God"). Those beside St. George read ("Born in Cappadocia, he was soldier of Christ. Fleeing the idleness / pleasures of the world, he triumphed over death and vanquished <a href="Saint%20George%20and%20the%20Dragon">the dragon</a>". The letters are inscribed on George's breastplate.

Mary's robe is embroidered with Latin text, taken from the : "Est enim haec speciosior sole et super omnem stellarum dispositionem. Luci conparata invenitur prior" ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior"). Van Eyck used a similar device in his Berlin "<a href="Madonna%20in%20the%20Church">Madonna in the Church</a>", completed c. 1438–40.

The painting remained in the church for which it was painted until after the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, and was one of the well-known artistic attractions of Bruges for visitors. It was presumably one of the paintings in the church praised by <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> in his diary in 1521. In 1547 <a href="Mary%20of%20Hungary%20%28governor%20of%20the%20Netherlands%29">Mary of Hungary</a>, Governess of the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>, wanted to buy it for her collection, but the chapter politely refused, saying this would create "moans, protests, uproar and complaints" from the people. During a spate of <a href="Beeldenstorm">Calvinist mob iconoclasm</a> in 1578 it was moved to a private house for safety, and by 1600 it had been given a setting with side wings and now formed the main altarpiece, replacing a destroyed metalwork <a href="retable">retable</a> of the 14th century. But by perhaps 1628 it was in the <a href="sacristy">sacristy</a> and from 1643 above a new side altar.

The painting was acquired, along with many other Netherlandish and Flemish works, by the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Musée du Louvre</a> in 1794, during the plundering of the estates of aristocrats in the years of the French revolutionary army's occupation of the Southern Netherlands. Other works acquired in this way include the centre panels of van Eyck's "Ghent Altarpiece", <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a>'s "Moreel Triptych" and <a href="Gerard%20David">Gerard David</a>'s "<a href="The%20Judgement%20of%20Cambyses">Judgement of Cambyses</a>". Many, including the van der Paele panel, were returned to <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> in 1816. The return of the panel became entangled in a dispute over control and ownership between the French and Dutch-speaking officials of Bruges, but it was entrusted to the Flemish Academy of Bruges. In 1855 it became part of the municipal collections, at first at the Bogaerdeschool Museum, until it became part of the collection of the <a href="Groeningemuseum">Groeningemuseum</a> in 1930.

The painting was widely influential in the 15th and 16th centuries. The set piece of Van Eyck's enthroned Virgin, with a distracted Child on her lap was both widely copied, and became a standard for the following 150 years. There are numerous surviving contemporary close and free copies, the most significant of which is the <a href="Royal%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20Antwerp">Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp</a>. <a href="Adriaen%20Isenbrandt">Adriaen Isenbrandt</a> included van der Paele's head in his "Mass of St Gregory" of 1550.

Both panel and frame are in good condition. That the panel retains its original frame makes it especially interesting to art historians, apart from its aesthetic qualities. The canvas has suffered little paint loss, board cracking, or other damage, and has been cleaned several times since it came into the possession of the Groeningemuseum.

Missing My Baby

"Missing My Baby" is a song released by American singer <a href="Selena">Selena</a> on her third studio album "<a href="Entre%20a%20Mi%20Mundo">Entre a Mi Mundo</a>" (1992). It was composed by <a href="A.B.%20Quintanilla">A.B. Quintanilla</a>—her brother and principal record producer, whose intention was to showcase Selena's diverse musical abilities. Selena included it on the album to help her <a href="crossover%20%28music%29">cross over</a> into the English-speaking market. Critics praised her emotive enunciation in the song. After <a href="Murder%20of%20Selena">Selena was murdered</a> in 1995, a posthumous music video made for <a href="VH1">VH1</a> was released to promote the triple box-set "<a href="Anthology%20%28Selena%20album%29">Anthology</a>" (1998).

"Missing My Baby" is a mid-tempo <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> <a href="ballad">ballad</a> influenced by <a href="urban%20music">urban</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>. The lyrics describe the love felt by the narrator, who reminisces of rhapsodic events she has shared with her lover. In some parts of the song, the narrator experiences loneliness and anguish because of the absence of her boyfriend. Although never intended to be released as a single, the track peaked at number 22 on the US <a href="Rhythmic%20Top%2040">Rhythmic Top 40</a> chart in 1995 after Selena's death.

"Missing My Baby" was written by <a href="Selena">Selena</a>'s brother and the song's principal record producer <a href="A.B.%20Quintanilla">A.B. Quintanilla</a>. It was created for Selena's 1992 album "<a href="Entre%20a%20Mi%20Mundo">Entre a Mi Mundo</a>", to showcase her diverse musical abilities and to add to the album's variety of musical styles, which include <a href="Music%20of%20Mexico">Mexican pop</a> and traditional Mexican songs, whereas "Missing My Baby" is in the style of <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">contemporary R&B</a>.

After the release of Selena's full-length Spanish albums "<a href="Selena%20%28album%29">Selena</a>" (1989) and "<a href="Ven%20Conmigo%20%28album%29">Ven Conmigo</a>" (1990), which included <a href="Tejano%20music">Tejano</a> and other Mexican pop styles, she decided that her next recording would feature an English-language song. She believed that such a song would convince <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI Records</a>' chairman <a href="Charles%20Koppelman">Charles Koppelman</a> that she was ready to release a <a href="crossover%20%28music%29">crossover</a> album. EMI had wanted her to acquire a larger fan base before launching her crossover career. In spite of this, Selena included the song on "Entre a Mi Mundo".

Quintanilla III wrote "Missing My Baby" in a week, and three weeks later, in late 1991, it was recorded at <a href="Sun%20Valley%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Sun Valley</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. EMI Latin wanted R&B duo <a href="Full%20Force">Full Force</a> to perform a remixed version of the recording. Quintanilla III and Selena met with the group at their Brooklyn recording studio, and Full Force agreed to add backing vocals, which they recorded in two days. <a href="EMI%20Latin">EMI Latin</a>, the record label Selena belongs to, chose Full Force's version of "Missing My Baby" instead of Selena's solo version of the song.

"Missing My Baby" is a mid-tempo <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> ballad with influences of <a href="urban%20music">urban</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>. It is in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="D%20major">D major</a>, at 144 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a> in <a href="common%20time">common time</a>. The recording incorporates <a href="melisma">melisma</a>, with <a href="sung%20poetry">sung poetry</a> during the downtempo part of the song. The melody is accompanied by backing vocals, and instrumentation is provided by an electric piano, drums, a keyboard, a synthesizer and strings. Contemporary music critics praised Selena's emotive enunciation, which emphasized the song's title and central theme. R&B duo Full Force were the backing vocalists for the original and remix versions of "Missing My Baby".

J.R. Reynolds, formerly of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", called "Missing My Baby" a "dreamy ballad" with an "R&B-styled melody under Selena's pop vocals". Ramiro Burr of the "<a href="Austin%20American-Statesman">Austin American-Statesman</a>" described it as a soul ballad. Jerry Johnston of the "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>" thought that Selena displayed a " baby-voice" in "Missing My Baby" and that she "displays a wonderful suppleness in her voice". "<a href="The%20Virginian-Pilot">The Virginian-Pilot</a>" said that the song was built on <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a> that recall Diana Ross's "<a href="Missing%20You%20%28Diana%20Ross%20song%29">Missing You</a>", which is a tribute to <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a>, and the Beach Boys' "<a href="Good%20to%20My%20Baby">Good to My Baby</a>".

The song begins with a drum solo before the other instruments enter to form the musical foundation. Selena sings to her absent lover about how much she misses him, saying that he is "always on [her] mind" and that she feels lonely when he is not with her. Three times she sings, "I often think of the happy times we spent together / And I just can't wait to tell you that I love you". In the <a href="refrain">chorus</a>, she sings of wanting to hold him tight and feel his heartbeat.

"Missing My Baby" received positive reviews from critics. "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" magazine reported that Full Force was awarded <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">gold and platinum discs</a> for "Missing My Baby" and "<a href="Techno%20Cumbia">Techno Cumbia</a>", and described "Missing My Baby" as giving a "hint of her aspirations". After it was remixed by Quintanilla III and later produced for the 1995 album "<a href="Dreaming%20of%20You%20%28Selena%20album%29">Dreaming of You</a>", the "Hi XD" said that it was the best English-language song on the album. Chris Riemenschneider and John T. Davis of the "Austin American-Statesman" wrote that "Missing My Baby can sound as fluffy as the Big M's "Crazy for You". Cary Clack of the "<a href="San%20Antonio%20Express-News">San Antonio Express-News</a>" wrote that "Missing My Baby" was played on non-Tejano radio stations and that he thought it might become a posthumous hit, while commenting that the recording "displays [Selena's] wonderful vocal and emotional range". However, Mario Tarradell of "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" believed that "Missing My Baby" and other tracks were added to "Entre a Mi Mundo" "for good measure".

"Missing My Baby" was one of the first Selena songs to be played on radio stations after she was <a href="Murder%20of%20Selena">murdered</a> by <a href="Yolanda%20Sald%C3%ADvar">Yolanda Saldívar</a>, her friend and former manager of her <a href="Selena%20Etc.">Selena Etc.</a> boutiques. A music video of the song, incorporating footage from Selena's personal home videos, was released for <a href="VH1">VH1</a> in 1998 to promote the triple box-set "<a href="Anthology%20%28Selena%20album%29">Anthology</a>". "Billboard" reported that the video was the 47th most played music video for that channel in the week ending 5 April 1998.

We Can Do It!

"We Can Do It!" is an American World War II wartime poster produced by J. Howard Miller in 1943 for <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20%281886%29">Westinghouse Electric</a> as an inspirational image to boost female worker morale.

The poster was very little seen during World War I. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms, often called "We Can Do It!" but also called "<a href="Rosie%20the%20Riveter">Rosie the Riveter</a>" after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker. The "We Can Do It!" image was used to promote <a href="feminism">feminism</a> and other political issues beginning in the 1980s. The image made the cover of the <a href="Smithsonian%20%28magazine%29">"Smithsonian"</a> magazine in 1994 and was fashioned into a US first-class mail stamp in 1999. It was incorporated in 2008 into campaign materials for several American politicians, and was reworked by an artist in 2010 to celebrate the <a href="Julia%20Gillard">first woman</a> becoming <a href="prime%20minister%20of%20Australia">prime minister of Australia</a>. The poster is one of the ten most-requested images at the <a href="National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration">National Archives and Records Administration</a>.

After its rediscovery, observers often assumed that the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. People have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.

After she saw the "Smithsonian" cover image in 1994, <a href="Geraldine%20Hoff%20Doyle">Geraldine Hoff Doyle</a> mistakenly said that she was the subject of the poster. Doyle thought that she had also been captured in a wartime photograph of a woman factory worker, and she innocently assumed that this photo inspired Miller's poster. Conflating her as "Rosie the Riveter", Doyle was honored by many organizations including the <a href="Michigan%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame</a>. However, in 2015, the woman in the wartime photograph was identified as then 20-year-old <a href="Naomi%20Parker%20Fraley">Naomi Parker</a>, working in early 1942 before Doyle had graduated from high school. Doyle's notion that the photograph inspired the poster cannot be proved or disproved, so neither Doyle nor Parker can be confirmed as the model for "We Can Do It!"

After the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, the U.S. government called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods. The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management and labor unions throughout the 1930s. Directors of companies such as <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> (GM) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork. In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the <a href="United%20Auto%20Workers">United Auto Workers</a> union, GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling up their sleeves, aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production. The poster read, "Together We Can Do It!" and "Keep 'Em Firing!" In creating such posters, corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro-war sentiment, with the ultimate goal of preventing the government from exerting greater control over production.

J. Howard Miller was an American <a href="graphic%20artist">graphic artist</a>. He painted posters during World War II in support of the war effort, among them the famous "We Can Do It!" poster Aside from the iconic poster, Miller remains largely unknown. Little has been written about Miller's life, and the year of his birth and death are uncertain. His life span has been published as "ca. 1915 – ca. 1990", "ca. 1915 – 1990", and "1918–2004"

Miller studied at the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Pittsburgh">Art Institute of Pittsburgh</a>, graduating in 1939. He lived in Pittsburgh during the war. His work came to the attention of the Westinghouse Company (later, the Westinghouse War Production Co-Ordinating Committee), and he was hired to create a series of posters. The posters were sponsored by the company's internal War Production Co-Ordinating Committee, one of the hundreds of labor-management committees organized under the supervision of the national War Production Board.

In 1942, Miller was hired by Westinghouse Electric's internal War Production Coordinating Committee, through an advertising agency, to create a series of posters to display to the company's workers. The intent of the poster project was to raise worker morale, to reduce absenteeism, to direct workers' questions to management, and to lower the likelihood of labor unrest or a factory strike. Each of the more than 42 posters designed by Miller was displayed in the factory for two weeks, then replaced by the next one in the series. Most of the posters featured men; they emphasized traditional roles for men and women. One of the posters pictured a smiling male manager with the words "Any Questions About Your Work? ... Ask your Supervisor."
No more than 1,800 copies of the 17-by-22-inch (559 by 432 mm) "We Can Do It!" poster were printed. It was not initially seen beyond several Westinghouse factories in <a href="East%20Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, and the midwestern U.S., where it was scheduled to be displayed for two five-day work weeks starting Monday, February 15, 1943. The targeted factories were making plasticized helmet liners impregnated with <a href="Micarta">Micarta</a>, a phenolic resin invented by Westinghouse. Mostly women were employed in this enterprise, which yielded some 13 million helmet liners over the course of the war. The slogan "We Can Do It!" was probably not interpreted by the factory workers as empowering to women alone; they had been subjected to a series of paternalistic, controlling posters promoting management authority, employee capability and company unity, and the workers would likely have understood the image to mean "Westinghouse Employees Can Do It", all working together. The upbeat image served as gentle propaganda to boost employee morale and keep production from lagging. The badge on the "We Can Do It!" worker's collar identifies her as a Westinghouse Electric plant floor employee; the pictured red, white and blue clothing was a subtle call to patriotism, one of the frequent tactics of corporate war production committees.

During World War II, the "We Can Do It!" poster was not connected to the 1942 song "Rosie the Riveter", nor to the widely seen <a href="Norman%20Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> painting called "Rosie the Riveter" that appeared on the cover of the <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> issue of the "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>", May 29, 1943. The Westinghouse poster was not associated with any of the women nicknamed "Rosie" who came forward to promote women working for war production on the home front. Rather, after being displayed for two weeks in February 1943 to some Westinghouse factory workers, it disappeared for nearly four decades. Other "Rosie" images prevailed, often photographs of actual workers. The <a href="United%20States%20Office%20of%20War%20Information">Office of War Information</a> geared up for a massive nationwide advertising campaign to sell the war, but "We Can Do It!" was not part of it.

Rockwell's emblematic "Rosie the Riveter" painting was loaned by the "Post" to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">U.S. Treasury Department</a> for use in posters and campaigns promoting <a href="war%20bond">war bond</a>s. Following the war, the Rockwell painting gradually sank from public memory because it was copyrighted; all of Rockwell's paintings were vigorously defended by his estate after his death. This protection resulted in the original painting gaining value—it sold for nearly $5 million in 2002. Conversely, the lack of protection for the "We Can Do It!" image is one of the reasons it experienced a rebirth.

Ed Reis, a volunteer historian for Westinghouse, noted that the original image was not shown to female <a href="riveter">riveter</a>s during the war, so the recent association with "Rosie the Riveter" was unjustified. Rather, it was targeted at women who were making helmet liners out of <a href="Micarta">Micarta</a>. Reis joked that the woman in the image was more likely to have been named "Molly the Micarta Molder or Helen the Helmet Liner Maker."

In 1982, the "We Can Do It!" poster was reproduced in a magazine article, "Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake", a <a href="The%20Washington%20Post">"Washington Post Magazine"</a> article about posters in the collection of the <a href="National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration">National Archives</a>.

In subsequent years, the poster was re-appropriated to promote <a href="feminism">feminism</a>. Feminists saw in the image an embodiment of female empowerment. The "We" was understood to mean "We Women", uniting all women in a sisterhood fighting against gender inequality. This was very different from the poster's 1943 use to control employees and to discourage labor unrest. History professor Jeremiah Axelrod commented on the image's combination of femininity with the "masculine (almost macho) composition and body language."

<a href="Smithsonian%20%28magazine%29">"Smithsonian"</a> magazine put the image on its cover in March 1994, to invite the viewer to read a featured article about wartime posters. The <a href="US%20Postal%20Service">US Postal Service</a> created a 33¢ stamp in February 1999 based on the image, with the added words "Women Support War Effort". A Westinghouse poster from 1943 was put on display at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20American%20History">National Museum of American History</a>, part of the exhibit showing items from the 1930s and '40s.

In 1984, former war worker <a href="Geraldine%20Doyle">Geraldine Hoff Doyle</a> came across an article in "<a href="AARP%20The%20Magazine">Modern Maturity</a>" magazine which showed a wartime photograph of a young woman working at a lathe, and she assumed that the photograph was taken of her in mid-to-late 1942 when she was working briefly in a factory. Ten years later, Doyle saw the "We Can Do It!" poster on the front of the <a href="Smithsonian%20%28magazine%29">"Smithsonian"</a> magazine and assumed the poster was an image of herself. Without intending to profit from the connection, Doyle decided that the 1942 wartime photograph had inspired Miller to create the poster, making Doyle herself the model for the poster. Subsequently, Doyle was widely credited as the inspiration for Miller's poster. From an archive of <a href="ACME%20Newspictures">Acme news photographs</a>, Professor James J. Kimble obtained the original photographic print, including its yellowed caption identifying the woman as <a href="Naomi%20Parker%20Fraley">Naomi Parker</a>. The photo is one of a series of photographs taken at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Alameda">Naval Air Station Alameda</a> in California, showing Parker and her sister working at their war jobs during March 1942. These images were published in various newspapers and magazines beginning in April 1942, during a time when Doyle was still attending high school in Michigan. In February 2015, Kimble interviewed the Parker sisters, now named Naomi Fern Fraley, 93, and her sister Ada Wyn Morford, 91, and found that they had known for five years about the incorrect identification of the photo, and had been rebuffed in their attempt to correct the historical record. Naomi Parker Fraley died age 96 on January 20, 2018.

Although many publications have repeated Doyle's unsupported assertion that the wartime photograph inspired Miller's poster, Westinghouse historian Charles A. Ruch, a Pittsburgh resident who had been friends with J. Howard Miller, said that Miller was not in the habit of working from photographs, but rather live models. However, the photograph of Naomi Parker did appear in the Pittsburgh Press on July 5, 1942, making it possible that Miller saw it as he was creating the poster.

Today, the image has become very widely known, far beyond its narrowly defined purpose during WWII. It has adorned T-shirts, tattoos, coffee cups and refrigerator magnets—so many different products that the "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" called it the "most over-exposed" souvenir item available in Washington, D.C. It was used in 2008 by some of the various regional campaigners working to elect <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a>, <a href="Ron%20Paul">Ron Paul</a> and <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>. <a href="Michelle%20Obama">Michelle Obama</a> was worked into the image by some attendees of the 2010 <a href="Rally%20to%20Restore%20Sanity%20and/or%20Fear">Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear</a>. The image has been employed by corporations such as <a href="Clorox">Clorox</a> who used it in advertisements for household cleaners, the pictured woman provided in this instance with a wedding ring on her left hand. Parodies of the image have included famous women, men, animals and fictional characters. A <a href="bobblehead">bobblehead</a> doll and an <a href="action%20figure">action figure</a> toy have been produced. <a href="The%20Children%27s%20Museum%20of%20Indianapolis">The Children's Museum of Indianapolis</a> showed a replica made by artist Kristen Cumings from thousands of <a href="Jelly%20Belly">Jelly Belly</a> candies.

After <a href="Julia%20Gillard">Julia Gillard</a> became the first female <a href="prime%20minister%20of%20Australia">prime minister of Australia</a> in June 2010, a <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> <a href="street%20art">street art</a>ist calling himself Phoenix pasted Gillard's face into a new monochrome version of the "We Can Do It!" poster. "<a href="AnOther%20Magazine">AnOther Magazine</a>" published a photograph of the poster taken on <a href="Hosier%20Lane%2C%20Melbourne">Hosier Lane, Melbourne</a>, in July 2010, showing that the original "War Production Co-ordinating Committee" mark in the lower right had been replaced with a <a href="Uniform%20resource%20locator">URL</a> pointing to Phoenix's <a href="Flickr">Flickr</a> photostream. In March 2011, Phoenix produced a color version which stated "She Did It!" in the lower right, then in January 2012 he pasted "Too Sad" diagonally across the poster to represent his disappointment with developments in Australian politics.

Geraldine Doyle died in December 2010. "<a href="Utne%20Reader">Utne Reader</a>" went ahead with their scheduled January–February 2011 cover image: a parody of "We Can Do It!" featuring <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge Simpson</a> raising her right hand in a fist. The editors of the magazine expressed regret at the passing of Doyle.

A <a href="Stereoscopy">stereoscopic</a> (3D) image of "We Can Do It!" was created for the closing credits of the 2011 superhero film "". The image served as the background for the title card of English actress <a href="Hayley%20Atwell">Hayley Atwell</a>.

The <a href="Ad%20Council">Ad Council</a> claimed the poster was developed in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, as part of a "Women in War Jobs" campaign, helping to bring "over two million women" into war production. In February 2012 during the Ad Council's 70th anniversary celebration, an interactive application designed by <a href="Animax">Animax</a>'s <a href="HelpsGood">HelpsGood</a> digital agency was linked to the Ad Council's <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page. The <a href="Facebook%20Platform">Facebook app</a> was called "Rosify Yourself", referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the "We Can Do It!" poster, then saved to be shared with friends. Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own "Rosified" face on "<a href="Huffington%20Post">Huffington Post</a>" in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history. The staff of the television show <a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">"Today"</a> posted two "Rosified" images on their website, using the faces of news anchors <a href="Matt%20Lauer">Matt Lauer</a> and <a href="Ann%20Curry">Ann Curry</a>. However, <a href="Seton%20Hall%20University">Seton Hall University</a> professor James J. Kimble and <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a> professor Lester C. Olson researched the origins of the poster and determined that it was not produced by the Ad Council nor was it used for recruiting women workers.

Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin, BWV 125

<a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> composed the <a href="Bach%20cantata">cantata</a> ' (; With peace and joy I depart), ', for use in a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> service. He composed this <a href="Chorale%20cantata%20%28Bach%29">chorale cantata</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> in 1725 for the feast for the Purification of Mary which is celebrated on 2 February and is also known as <a href="Candlemas">Candlemas</a>. The cantata is based on <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s 1524 <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "", and forms part of Bach's <a href="chorale%20cantata%20cycle">chorale cantata cycle</a>, written to provide Sundays and <a href="feast%20days">feast days</a> of the <a href="liturgical%20year">liturgical year</a> with cantatas based on a related Lutheran hymn.

<a href="Gospel%20%28liturgy%29">The gospel for the feast day</a>, the <a href="presentation%20of%20Jesus%20at%20the%20Temple">presentation of Jesus at the Temple</a>, includes <a href="Simeon%20%28Gospel%20of%20Luke%29">Simeon</a>'s <a href="canticle">canticle</a> , which Luther paraphrased in his hymn, providing an unusually close relation of the hymn and the liturgical occasion. Bach had used single <a href="stanzas">stanzas</a> of the hymn in his <a href="Bach%27s%20early%20cantatas">early</a> funeral cantata , and in cantatas of <a href="Bach%27s%20first%20cantata%20cycle">his first Leipzig cycle</a>.

In the format of the chorale cantata cycle, an unknown <a href="Libretto">librettist</a> retained the first and the last of Luther's four stanzas, while he paraphrased the inner stanzas. In this cantata, he also used the original text of the second stanza, interspersed with his words, as the third movement, a <a href="recitative">recitative</a>, after he paraphrased the same ideas for the second movement, an <a href="aria">aria</a>. The librettist derived text for two more <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movement</a>s from Luther's third stanza. Bach structured the cantata in six movements, framing four movements for soloists by a <a href="chorale%20fantasia">chorale fantasia</a> and a closing <a href="chorale">chorale</a>. He scored the work for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a <a href="Baroque%20instruments">Baroque ensemble</a> consisting of horn, flauto traverso, oboe, oboe d'amore, strings and basso continuo. The opening chorus has been compared to the opening movement of Bach's "<a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion">St Matthew Passion</a>". In the third movement, Bach sets the single lines from the hymn's second stanza differently from the commentary in the librettist's words, but unifies both elements by a continuous "<a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a> of joy" in the accompaniment.

In 1723, <a href="Bach">Bach</a> was appointed as "<a href="Thomaskantor">Thomaskantor</a>" (director of church music) in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>. He was employed by the town of Leipzig to this position, which made him responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the "<a href="Thomanerchor">Thomanerchor</a>". Cantata music had to be provided for two major churches, <a href="Thomaskirche">Thomaskirche</a> (St. Thomas) and <a href="Nikolaikirche%2C%20Leipzig">Nikolaikirche</a> (St. Nicholas), simpler church music for two others, <a href="St.%20Matthew%2C%20Leipzig">Neue Kirche</a> (New Church) and <a href="St.%20Peter%2C%20Leipzig">Peterskirche</a> (St. Peter).

Bach took office in the middle of the liturgical year, on the first Sunday after <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity</a>. In Leipzig, cantata music was expected on Sundays and on feast days, except during the "silent periods" ("<a href="tempus%20clausum">tempus clausum</a>") of <a href="Advent">Advent</a> and <a href="Lent">Lent</a>. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events. These works became known as his <a href="Bach%27s%20first%20cantata%20cycle">first cantata cycle</a>. The year after, he continued that effort, composing a <a href="Chorale%20cantata%20cycle">cycle of chorale cantatas</a>, with each cantata based on one <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> hymn, including "Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin", for these occasions. The choice of hymns to use in the series of chorale cantatas was probably made according to the wishes of a local minister, who based the choice upon the prescribed readings and his plans for sermons.

In the 16th century <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, the <a href="Protestant%20Reformers">Protestant reformer</a>, emphasised the importance of hymn singing in church services and at home, authoring <a href="List%20of%20hymns%20by%20Martin%20Luther">many hymns</a>, including "Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin".

Bach composed an <a href="Bach%27s%20early%20cantatas">early</a> chorale cantata on a hymn by Luther, <a href="Christ%20lag%20in%20Todes%20Banden%2C%20BWV%204">"Christ lag in Todes Banden", BWV 4</a>, probably in 1707. During his chorale cantata cycle, Bach used a hymn by Luther as the basis for a cantata on nine occasions. Additionally, he performed "Christ lag in Todes Banden" again during that cycle.

The following table shows the cantatas that Bach performed on hymns by Luther during the chorala cantata cycle, comprising nine new compositions and the repeated performance of the Easter cantata. The first column holds the cantata number, with a link, to the article about it, the following column holds the hymn of the same name, on which it is based. The third column shows the liturgical occasion, and the fourth the date of the performance, which is the first performance for all but the Easter cantata.

Bach used Luther's hymns in other works during his career. He had included "" earlier in a cantata for Advent, <a href="Alles%2C%20was%20von%20Gott%20geboren%2C%20BWV%2080a">"Alles, was von Gott geboren", BWV 80a</a>, which he reworked as a chorale cantata for <a href="Church%20cantata%23Reformation%20Day%20%2831%20October%29">Reformation Day</a> (<a href="BWV%2080">BWV 80</a>). He finally composed , for the <a href="Church%20cantata%23Fourth%20Sunday%20after%20Epiphany%20%28Epiphany%20IV%29">Fourth Sunday after Epiphany</a> in 1735.

Bach followed a specific structure for most of the cantatas in this cycle. He deviated from using the <a href="strophic%20form">strophic</a> hymn text and tune in all stanzas ("per omnes versus"), as he had in . Instead, he retained the original text and melody only in the outer stanzas, typically treating the first as a chorale fantasia and the last as a four-part chorale setting, while the inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as the basis for recitatives and arias, often with music independent of the hymn tune. <a href="Andreas%20St%C3%BCbel">Andreas Stübel</a> (1653–1725), a former headmaster of the "<a href="Thomasschule">Thomasschule</a>", may have been this librettist.

During Bach's time in Leipzig, three <a href="Marian%20devotion">Marian</a> feasts were observed and celebrated: <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a> (25 March), <a href="Visitation%20%28Christianity%29">Visitation</a> (2 July) and <a href="Church%20cantata%23Purification%20%282%20February%29">Purification</a> (2 February). The <a href="Church%20cantata%23Purification%20%282%20February%29">prescribed readings</a> for the Feast of the Purification, (German: ), were from the <a href="Book%20of%20Malachi">Book of Malachi</a>'s, "the Lord will come to his temple" (), and the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>'s version of the purification of Mary and the presentation of Jesus at the Temple, which includes <a href="Simeon%20%28Gospel%20of%20Luke%29">Simeon</a>'s <a href="canticle">canticle</a> ().

When Luther wrote his hymn on Simeon's canticle ("With peace and joy I depart in God's will"), he devoted one stanza to each of the four verses of the biblical text. The first verse discusses peaceful acceptance of death (), the second gives as a reason for that the meeting with the Saviour (), the third is focused on Christ's return for all people (), the fourth sees the <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a> as a light for the heathen and glory for Israel (). The lines are of different length, with a <a href="Metre%20%28poetry%29">metre</a> of 8.4.8.4.7.7, stressing single statements in the short lines.

The tune first appeared in 1524 in <a href="Johann%20Walter">Johann Walter</a>'s choral hymnal . Luther wrote commentary on his hymn: 

Bach first used the hymn as part of his early funeral cantata (), the <a href="alto">alto</a> singing the first stanza, juxtaposed to a <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a> <a href="arioso">arioso</a>, "<a href="Gottes%20Zeit%20ist%20die%20allerbeste%20Zeit%2C%20BWV%20106%233">Heute wirst du mit mir im Paradies sein</a>". He returned to it twice for his first Leipzig cantata cycle. The first stanza was the basis for his cantata for the 16th Sunday after Trinity of 1723, , along with the first stanza of the funeral hymn "" in the opening movement for tenor. The second occasion was in 1724, in the Purification cantata, , which he closed with the fourth and final stanza, "".

For "Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin", a librettist retained the first and the last stanza and paraphrased the two inner stanzas to four movements. The second movement, based on Luther's second stanza, is focused on Simeon's perspective as a means of how to anticipate one's own death. The third movement interweaves Luther's complete text with a free recitative. The Bach scholar <a href="Klaus%20Hofmann">Klaus Hofmann</a> notes that the librettist had room to add his own text because Luther's hymn is rather short. The allusion to "light for the heathen" from the gospel and the hymn refers to "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved" (). Luther's third stanza forms the basis for the fourth and fifth movements. The fourth movement refers to <a href="St%20Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a>'s teaching about the <a href="Divine%20Grace">grace of God</a>, ("Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God") (). It declares the Lutheran teaching of justification "by grace alone through faith alone because of Christ alone" even more clearly than Luther's song.

Bach led the first performance with the "Thomanerchor" in the morning service at the <a href="St.%20Nicholas%20Church%2C%20Leipzig">Nikolaikirche</a> on 2 February 1725, and reprised it in the <a href="Vespers">vesper service</a> in the <a href="St.%20Thomas%20Church%2C%20Leipzig">Thomaskirche</a>, as was usual in Leipzig on high holidays. Bach performed it at least one more time after 1735.

Bach structured the cantata in six movements. The first and last are set for choir as a <a href="chorale%20fantasia">chorale fantasia</a> and a closing <a href="chorale">chorale</a>. They frame alternating recitatives and arias with the text arranged by the librettist. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (<a href="alto">alto</a> (A), <a href="tenor">tenor</a> (T) and <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a> (B)), a <a href="SATB">four-part choir</a>, and a <a href="Baroque%20instruments">Baroque instrumental</a> ensemble: <a href="Natural%20horn">horn</a> to support the chorale tune sung by the soprano in the outer movements, <a href="flauto%20traverso">flauto traverso</a> (Ft), <a href="oboe">oboe</a> (Ob), <a href="oboe%20d%27amore">oboe d'amore</a> (Oa), two <a href="violin">violin</a>s (Vl), <a href="viola">viola</a> (Va), and <a href="basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a> (Bc). The title page of the original parts reads: "Festo Purificat: Mari[ae] / Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin etc. / â / 4 Voc: / Travers: / Hautbois d' Amour / 2 Violini / Viola / con / Continuo / di / Sign: / JS. Bach". The duration of the cantata is given as around 24 minutes.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the <a href="Neue%20Bach-Ausgabe">Neue Bach-Ausgabe</a>. The <a href="Key%20%28music%29">keys</a> and <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s are taken from the book by Bach scholar <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%BCrr">Alfred Dürr</a>, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.

The opening chorus, "" (With peace and joy I depart in God's will), begins with a concertante <a href="ritornello">ritornello</a>, in which the flute and the oboe play opposed to the strings. A <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a> in <a href="Triplet%20%28music%29">triplets</a> has first a leap of a <a href="Perfect%20fifth">fifth</a>, related to the first <a href="Interval%20%28music%29">interval</a> of the chorale tune. The fifth and the triplet motion dominate the entire movement.

The soprano sings the in long notes. Hofmann notes that the <a href="Dorian%20mode">Dorian mode</a> within the instrumental concerto in E minor adds a "slightly archaic flavour". The lower voices participate in the instrumental motifs for lines 1, 2, 3 and 5, but lines 4 and 6 are treated differently. In accordance to the text, "sanft und stille" (calm and quiet) and "der Tod ist mein Schlaf worden" (death has become my sleep), they are performed softly (piano), in <a href="homophony">homophony</a>, <a href="Chromatic%20scale">chromatic</a>, and <a href="Modulation%20%28music%29">modulating</a> to distant keys. Dürr notes the movement's "extremely dense, highly expressive texture" with motifs independent from the hymn tune but derived from its beginning. The Bach scholar <a href="Richard%20D.%20P.%20Jones">Richard D. P. Jones</a> observes that the movement foreshadows , the opening chorus of Bach's St Matthew Passion, in key, 12/8 <a href="Metre%20%28music%29">metre</a> and "much else".

The alto aria, "" (Even with broken eyes, I will look for You, my loving Savior.), is a <a href="Sarabande">Sarabande</a> with slow dotted rhythms. The vocal line is accompanied by the flute and oboe d'amore, on a foundation of repeated notes in the continuo, marked "legato". The phrase "" (broken eyes) is pictured by a broken vocal line, flute and oboe d'amore play dotted rhythm to the "almost trembling declamation" of the voice. Hofmann notes the movement's "emotions of grief and lamentation", while Dürr writes: "Rich suspension <a href="appoggiatura">appoggiatura</a>s, and other ornaments reveal that an expressive interpretation of this movement lay particularly close to the composer's heart."

The bass recitative begins with a thought of the librettist, "" (O wonder, that a heart before the flesh-abhorred tomb, and even the pain of death does not recoil!). The text continues with the beginning of the hymn's second stanza."" (Christ, God's true son, does this, the loving Savior). The pattern of comment and original is retained throughout the movement in a hybrid text that holds in single lines the complete text of the second stanza:

Bach sets the elements recitative and chorale differently, rendering the librettist's text in "rhythmically free diction of recitative", and the chorale as arioso. He unifies the movement by a continuous motif in the strings, called by Dürr, which "always indicates an underlying mood of happiness". The chorale tune is unadorned but for the last line, "" (in death and also in dying), where the music is extended by two measures and coloured in chromatic and rich ornamentation, and the strings cease to play the constant motif and accompany in "tranquil notes".

The tenor and bass duet "" (An unfathomable light fills the entire orb of the earth), is focused on the light mentioned by Simeon, expressed in a joyful mood. The Hofmann notes: "The playful character is shown by the extended, circling <a href="coloratura">coloratura</a> on the word 'Kreis' ('circle' or 'orb'), and the baroque sound effect of statement and response unfolds to the words 'Es schallet kräftig fort und fort' (Powerfully there rings out time after time.)" Jones comments that the <a href="trio%20sonata">trio sonata</a> of two violins and continuo which accompanies the voices "in its vigour and fluency perhaps represents the powerful, continuous sound to which the text refers."

The alto expresses in a secco recitative "" (O uncreated hoard of goodness), which Hofmann calls a "concise theological analysis".

The closing chorale, "" (He is the salvation and the blessed light), is a four-part setting of the hymn tune.

The horn, the flute (an octave higher), the oboe and the first violin all reinforce the soprano part, the second violin the alto, and the viola the tenor.

Jones summarizes in his book "The Creative Development of Johann Sebastian Bach": "The exceptionally high quality of the music may reflect Bach's response to the divine authority of the Nunc dimittis, mediated by the revered founder of the Lutheran Church."

The <a href="Music%20manuscript">autograph score</a> is lost, its last documented owner being <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Penzel">Christian Friedrich Penzel</a>, one of Bach's last students and a copyist of his works. The original parts are kept in the <a href="Bach-Archiv%20Leipzig">Bach-Archiv Leipzig</a>. They were copied from the lost autograph score by four scribes, three of them known by name, including the composer. A set of three duplicate parts is kept in the <a href="Berlin%20State%20Library">Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin</a> – Preußischer Kulturbesitz as D-B Mus. ms. Bach St 384, Faszikel 1. They were copied by five scribes, of which three are known by name: Christian Gottlob Meißner, <a href="Wilhelm%20Friedemann%20Bach">Wilhelm Friedemann Bach</a> and Johann Andreas Kuhnau. The set has a title page and parts for violin I and II, and continuo.

The score for the first movement was first published by <a href="Anton%20Diabelli">Anton Diabelli</a> around 1835 with a Latin text, "Da pacem nobis Domine". The cantata was originally published in 1878 as in volume 26 of the <a href="Bach-Gesellschaft%20Ausgabe">Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe</a> (BGA), edited by <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%B6rffel">Alfred Dörffel</a>. The <a href="New%20Bach%20Edition">New Bach Edition</a> (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score in 1994, edited by Uwe Wolf, with the critical commentary published the same year.

A critical edition was published by <a href="Breitkopf%20%26amp%3B%20H%C3%A4rtel">Breitkopf</a>, edited by Eva-Maria Hodel. Another was published by <a href="Carus-Verlag">Carus</a> in 2008, edited by Wolfram Enßlin, which also provided a singable English version.

North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest

The North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest (<a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">SSSI</a>) is an area of European importance for wildlife in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, England. It comprises 7,700 ha (19,027 acres) of the county's north coast from just west of <a href="Holme-next-the-Sea">Holme-next-the-Sea</a> to <a href="Kelling">Kelling</a>, and is additionally protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) listings; it is also part of the <a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20AONB">Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB). The North Norfolk Coast is also designated as a wetland of international importance on the <a href="Ramsar%20list%20of%20wetlands%20of%20international%20importance">Ramsar list</a> and most of it is a <a href="Biosphere%20Reserve">Biosphere Reserve</a>.

Habitats within the SSSI include <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a>s, <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>es, freshwater <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s and sand or <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle beach</a>es. The wetlands are important for wildlife, including some scarce breeding birds such as <a href="pied%20avocet">pied avocet</a>s, <a href="western%20marsh%20harrier">western marsh harrier</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20bittern">Eurasian bittern</a>s and <a href="bearded%20reedling">bearded reedling</a>s. The location also attracts <a href="bird%20migration">migrating birds</a> including <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> rarities. Ducks and geese winter along this coast in considerable numbers, and several <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a>s provide suitable conditions for <a href="European%20water%20vole">water vole</a>s, <a href="natterjack%20toad">natterjack toad</a>s and several scarce plants and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s.

The area is <a href="archaeology">archaeologically</a> significant, with <a href="artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artefacts</a> dating back to the <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a>. The mound of an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> fort is visible at <a href="Holkham">Holkham</a>, and the site of a 23 ha (57 acres) <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> naval port with a fort built on the <a href="castrum">castrum</a> pattern is just outside <a href="Brancaster">Brancaster</a>. The site of the medieval "<a href="Blakeney%20Chapel">chapel</a>" (probably a domestic dwelling) at <a href="Blakeney%2C%20Norfolk">Blakeney</a> is no longer accessible. Remains of military use from both <a href="world%20war">world war</a>s include an <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a> gunnery range, a hospital and bombing ranges, as well as passive defences such as <a href="British%20hardened%20field%20defences%20of%20World%20War%20II">pillboxes</a>, barbed wire and <a href="Dragon%27s%20teeth%20%28fortification%29">tank traps</a>.

The SSSI is economically important to the area because of the tourists it attracts for <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a> and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from the large numbers of visitors. Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> considers that <a href="managed%20retreat">managed retreat</a> is likely to be the long-term solution, and is working with the <a href="Norfolk%20Wildlife%20Trust">Norfolk Wildlife Trust</a> to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.

The SSSI is a long, narrow strip of coast that starts at the eastern boundary of <a href="The%20Wash">The Wash</a> between <a href="Old%20Hunstanton">Old Hunstanton</a> and <a href="Holme-next-the-Sea">Holme-next-the-Sea</a>, and runs east for about 43 km (27 mi) to <a href="Kelling">Kelling</a>. The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the <a href="A149%20road">A149 coast road</a>.

The SSSI has a wide variety of habitats, with bare mud, sand and shingle characterising the <a href="intertidal%20zone">intertidal zone</a> along the whole of the coast, although higher areas may have <a href="algae">algae</a> or <a href="Zostera%20marina">eelgrass</a> that are grazed by ducks and geese in winter. The <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>es which form on sheltered coasts, in the lee of islands, or behind spits are described in the SSSI notification document as "among the best in Europe" due to their exceptionally diverse flora. Sand dunes occur at several places along the coast, but the best examples are at <a href="Holme%20Dunes">Holme Dunes</a>, <a href="Holkham">Holkham</a>, <a href="Blakeney%20Point">Blakeney Point</a>, and <a href="Scolt%20Head%20Island">Scolt Head Island</a>. The latter two sites are also important for <a href="geomorphology">geomorphology</a> research purposes as structures consisting mainly of shingle ridges. <a href="Reed%20bed">Reed bed</a>s are fairly localised, but substantial areas occur at <a href="Titchwell%20Marsh">Titchwell Marsh</a>, Brancaster and <a href="Cley%20Marshes">Cley Marshes</a>. Grassland is represented by grazing pasture reclaimed from former salt marsh, with wetter areas at Cley and <a href="Salthouse">Salthouse</a> marshes. Woodland is limited in the SSSI, although a belt of <a href="Pinus%20nigra">Corsican pine</a> planted at Holkham has provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established.

Norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the <a href="Paleolithic">Palaeolithic</a>, and including significant <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>. Both <a href="anatomically%20modern%20humans">modern</a> and <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last <a href="glacial%20period">glaciation</a>, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The <a href="Archaeology">archaeological</a> record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> (10,000–5,000 BCE), the <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> rose, filling what is now the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are under the sea. Early Mesolithic <a href="flint">flint</a> tools with characteristic <a href="Blade%20%28archaeology%29">long blades</a> up to long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell date from a time when it was from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a> (50,000–10,000 BCE) to the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> (5,000–2,500 BCE).

By 11,000 BC, the makers of the long blades had gone. Two timber platforms have been identified within the <a href="peat">peat</a> at Titchwell, and may possibly be rare <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Bronze Age</a> (2,500–800 BCE) survivals. <a href="Seahenge">Seahenge</a> is another early Bronze Age site found on the coast at Holme in 1998. It consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049 BC; a similar nearby structure, Holme II, may be almost two centuries older. A large <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> fort at Holkham enclosed 2.5 ha (6.1 acres) at the end of a sandy spit in what was then salt marsh, and remained in use until the defeat of the <a href="Iceni">Iceni</a> in 47 AD.

Roman period settlements have been discovered all along the Norfolk Coast, notably the complex at <a href="Branodunum">Branodunum</a>, which covered at least 23 ha (57 acres) near Brancaster. This site included a fort built on the <a href="castrum">castrum</a> pattern enclosing 2.6 ha (6.3 acres) within its walls, 2.9 m (10 ft) wide. The fort had internal turrets at the corners and was backed by an earth rampart. Early <a href="Saxon">Saxon</a> sites are scarce close to the Norfolk coast, but a gold <a href="bracteate">bracteate</a> found near <a href="Blakeney%20Chapel">Blakeney Chapel</a> was a rare and significant 6th-century find, and there is a somewhat later Saxon cemetery at Thornham. The <a href="Danelaw">Danelaw</a> left few tangible traces within the SSSI, but place names such as Holkham ("ship town") reflect the Viking influence. Saxon building foundations were described as the ruins of "Cley Chapel" on a 1797 map, although it is more likely that they belonged to a barn.

An "eye" is an area of higher ground in the marshes, dry enough to support buildings. Cley Eye had been farmed since the earliest human habitation, and was 28 ha (70 acres) in extent in 1651, but is much reduced by coastal erosion. The Eye and its Saxon barn were accessed by an ancient <a href="causeway">causeway</a>, passable at low tide. A 1588 map showed "Black Joy Forte" in the same area, which may have been intended as a defence against the <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a>, but was never completed. On the other side of the Glaven, Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries, and a building known as "Blakeney Chapel", which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600, and again in the late 17th century. Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function. Nearly a third of the mostly 14th-to-16th-century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent, reflecting the Glaven ports' importance in international trade at this time.

The sheltered waters of <a href="Blakeney%20Haven">Blakeney Haven</a> had brought prosperity to the internationally important <a href="River%20Glaven">Glaven</a> ports of <a href="Cley-next-the-Sea">Cley</a>, <a href="Wiveton">Wiveton</a> and Blakeney. Blakeney gained its <a href="market%20charter">market charter</a> in 1222, and the three ports, along with Salthouse, were jointly required to provide three ships for <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward II</a> in 1322, having previously contributed to his father's navy in 1301. By the early 15th century, Blakeney was one of the few ports permitted to trade in horses, gold and silver, through "merchants sworn by oath to the king", which contributed to the town's growing wealth. In 1640, <a href="land%20reclamation">land reclamation</a> schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the <a href="wharf">wharf</a>, and further reclamation east of the Glaven meant that all the Glaven ports declined; Cley and Wiveton silted up in the 17th century, but Blakeney had <a href="packet%20ship">packet ship</a>s until 1840. Similar marsh reclamation schemes took place elsewhere, often with the same consequence for the local harbours, as for example at Holkham. Only <a href="Wells-next-the-Sea">Wells-next-the-Sea</a> had significant trade into the late 20th century.

Artillery may have been installed at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the <a href="Napoleonic%20wars">Napoleonic wars</a>, but there were no modern fortifications in north Norfolk at the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Following <a href="Raid%20on%20Yarmouth">the German naval attack on Great Yarmouth</a> in November 1914, defences such as trenches, concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast. The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries, but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> as a <a href="bombing%20range">bombing range</a>. A World War I concrete building on Titchwell's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> returned in 1942; some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period.

There were no new fortifications along this coast at the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. After the fall of France in 1940, the threat of invasion led to the creation of new defences. In addition to the installation of anti-tank and other passive obstacles, fourteen coastal batteries, each of two guns, were constructed. Some of these emplacements and other military bases fell within the SSSI area. Four <a href="spigot%20mortar">spigot mortar</a> base plates found at Holme dunes may not have originated at that site, since there is no record of such armament there. The marsh at Titchwell was reflooded, and <a href="British%20hardened%20field%20defences%20of%20World%20War%20II">pillboxes</a> built into the beach bank. Between 1942 and 1945, the marsh was used by the <a href="Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">Royal Tank Regiment</a>; an <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a> gunnery range was established and banks were constructed for firing practice, with targets set at intervals. Some of the still extant islands were built to hold "pop-up" targets, operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations now lie below a bird hide. Remains of the triangular concrete track used by the tanks also survive. Military activities continued in the area after the war, and the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> returned to Thornham Marsh between 1950 and 1959. Bombing practice was supervised from a control tower, which was demolished in 1962, leaving only a concrete structure opposite the end of Titchwell's west bank. The remains of two World War II <a href="Covenanter%20tank">Covenanter tank</a>s, probably used as targets, are sometimes exposed at low tide. The SS "Vina", an 1894 cargo steamer, was anchored offshore in 1944 for use as an RAF target, but a gale dragged her to the sands off Titchwell, where the wreck can still be seen at low tide.

Brancaster beach had a base including three pillboxes, <a href="Nissen%20hut">Nissen hut</a>s and two gun emplacements, and another possible base, comprising about fifty different structures, was located in a salt marsh north-east of Burnham Overy Staithe. A wreck at the west end of Scolt Head Island was used as a bombing target, and the remains of a <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Blenheim bomber</a> were found at the north of the island in 2004.

<a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> military fortifications were established at Cley beach, including two 6-inch (15.24 cm) guns, five buildings, two <a href="pillbox%20%28military%29">pillboxes</a>, a <a href="minefield">minefield</a>, and concrete anti-tank blocks. A <a href="Blacker%20Bombard">spigot mortar emplacement</a> and an <a href="Alan%20Williams%20turret">Allan Williams Turret</a> <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> emplacement were sited closer to the village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012. The military camp accommodated 160 men and was later used to hold <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. Near the end of the war, the camp was used to house East European <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s, and was finally pulled down in 1948. Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> in 1955, but the <a href="Electric%20generator">generator</a> house was taken over by the <a href="coastguard">coastguard</a> service as an observation post. It was acquired by the NWT in 1983, and the upper part was used as a look-out, while the larger lower section became a beach café. The building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008, and subsequently demolished.

The first step towards the protection of this coast by a national conservation body was the purchase of Blakeney Point from the <a href="Baron%20Calthorpe">Calthorpe family</a> by banker <a href="Charles%20Rothschild">Charles Rothschild</a> in 1912. Rothschild gave the property to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> in 1912, which has managed it since. In 1926, another early protected area was created when Norfolk <a href="birdwatcher">birdwatcher</a> Dr Sydney Long bought the land which makes up the Cley Marshes reserve for the sum of £5,100, to be held "in perpetuity as a bird breeding sanctuary". Long then went on to establish the <a href="Norfolk%20Wildlife%20Trust">Norfolk Wildlife Trust</a> (NWT).

The current SSSI was created in 1986 from pre-existing SSSIs at Blakeney Point, Holme Dunes, Cley, and Salthouse Marshes (all designated in 1954), Morston Saltmarshes and <a href="Brancaster%20Manor">Brancaster Manor</a> (1968), <a href="Stiffkey">Stiffkey</a> Saltmarshes (1969), <a href="Thornham%2C%20Norfolk">Thornham</a> Marshes (1972) and Titchwell Marshes (1973), together with the <a href="national%20nature%20reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">national nature reserve</a>s (NNRs) at Scolt Head Island (1967) and Holkham (1968), and substantial formerly undesignated areas.

Although much of the SSSI is in private hands, considerable areas are managed by large conservation organisations. As well as the two NNRs, there is an <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">RSPB</a> reserve at Titchwell Marsh, and Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserves are at Cley and Salthouse Marshes. The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR. In addition to Blakeney Point, the National Trust owns land at <a href="Brancaster">Brancaster Staithe</a>.

The SSSI covers 7,700 ha (19,027 acres) and is additionally protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) and <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> listings, and is part of the <a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20AONB">Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB). Scolt Head Island and the coast from the Holkham NNR to Salthouse are a <a href="World%20Network%20of%20Biosphere%20Reserves">Biosphere Reserve</a>.

The SSSI is designated as a Special Protection Area for birds for its variety of coastal habitats. The large breeding colonies of <a href="Sandwich%20tern">Sandwich tern</a>s and <a href="little%20tern">little tern</a>s, especially those at Blakeney Point and Scolt Head Island, are of "European importance" as defined in the <a href="Birds%20Directive">Birds Directive</a>, and the coast as a whole meets <a href="Natural%20England">Natural England's</a> criteria for nationally important populations of <a href="common%20tern">common tern</a>s, <a href="pied%20avocet">pied avocet</a>s and reedbed specialists like <a href="western%20marsh%20harrier">western marsh harrier</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20bittern">Eurasian bittern</a>s and <a href="bearded%20reedling">bearded reedling</a>s. Other birds nesting in the wetlands include the <a href="northern%20lapwing">northern lapwing</a>, <a href="common%20redshank">common redshank</a>, and <a href="sedge%20warbler">sedge</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20reed%20warbler">reed</a> and <a href="Cetti%27s%20warbler">Cetti's warbler</a>s. <a href="Common%20ringed%20plover">Ringed plovers</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20oystercatcher">Eurasian oystercatcher</a>s lay their eggs on bare sand in the dunes. <a href="Little%20egret">Little egret</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20spoonbill">Eurasian spoonbill</a>s, <a href="ruff">ruff</a>s and <a href="black-tailed%20godwit">black-tailed godwit</a>s are present for much of the year, and the egret and spoonbill have both started nesting within the SSSI.

In spring and early summer, <a href="bird%20migration">migrant birds</a> including the <a href="little%20gull">little gull</a>, <a href="black%20tern">black tern</a>, <a href="Temminck%27s%20stint">Temminck's stint</a> and <a href="garganey">garganey</a> may pass through on their way to breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as <a href="whimbrel">whimbrel</a>s, <a href="curlew%20sandpiper">curlew sandpiper</a>s and <a href="little%20stint">little stint</a>s, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, <a href="great%20skua">great</a> and <a href="Arctic%20skua">Arctic skua</a>s, <a href="northern%20gannet">northern gannet</a>s and <a href="black-legged%20kittiwake">black-legged kittiwake</a>s may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many <a href="Eurasian%20wigeon">Eurasian wigeon</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20teal">Eurasian teal</a>s, <a href="mallard">mallard</a>s and <a href="gadwall">gadwall</a>s, <a href="common%20goldeneye">goldeneyes</a> and <a href="northern%20pintail">northern pintail</a>s. <a href="Red-throated%20loon">Red-throated divers</a> are usually on the sea, and <a href="brant%20goose">brent geese</a> feed on <a href="Ulva">sea lettuce</a> and other <a href="green%20algae">green algae</a>. <a href="Barn%20owl">Barn owl</a>s and sometimes <a href="northern%20harrier">hen harriers</a> quarter the marshes in winter, and <a href="snow%20bunting">snow bunting</a> flocks can be found on the beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly <a href="pink-footed%20geese">pink-footed</a>, roost at Holkham.

The SSSI's north-facing east coast location can be favourable for huge numbers of migrating birds when the weather conditions are right. These may include <a href="vagrant%20species">vagrant</a> rarities. A <a href="black-winged%20stilt">black-winged stilt</a>, which acquired the nickname "Sammy", arrived at Titchwell in 1993 and became a permanent resident up to its disappearance in 2005. Other major rarities included a <a href="western%20sandpiper">western sandpiper</a> at Cley in 2012, a <a href="rufous-tailed%20robin">rufous-tailed robin</a> at Warham Greens in 2011, and a <a href="black-winged%20pratincole">black-winged pratincole</a> at Titchwell in 2009.

<a href="European%20water%20vole">Water voles</a> are a highly threatened species in the UK, with a 70–90% decline in numbers mainly due to predation by the introduced <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a>, but also habitat loss and water pollution. <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>n sites of national importance for this species include Cley, Titchwell and other Norfolk coastal sites. <a href="European%20hare">Brown hares</a> are widespread, and <a href="European%20otter">European otter</a>s may be seen at several locations. Both <a href="Harbour%20seal">common</a> and <a href="grey%20seal">grey seal</a>s can be seen at the Blakeney Point colony and off the beaches. The <a href="common%20frog">common frog</a>, <a href="common%20toad">common toad</a> and <a href="Viviparous%20lizard">common lizard</a> all occur in suitable habitats, and the rare <a href="natterjack%20toad">natterjack toad</a> breeds at Holkham and Holme.

The <a href="green%20hairstreak">green hairstreak</a>, <a href="purple%20hairstreak">purple hairstreak</a>, <a href="Macroglossum%20stellatarum">hummingbird hawk-moth</a> and <a href="ghost%20moth">ghost moth</a> are sometimes seen, particularly in the woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the <a href="Colias%20croceus">clouded yellow</a>, <a href="Nymphalis%20antiopa">Camberwell beauty</a>, <a href="Vanessa%20cardui">painted lady</a> or <a href="diamondback%20moth">diamondback moth</a> may be seen, and the <a href="silver%20Y">silver Y</a> can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The <a href="Cicindela%20hybrida">dune tiger beetle</a> is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.

The lagoons behind the shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty due to the percolation of seawater through the bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s including the <a href="starlet%20sea%20anemone">starlet sea anemone</a>, <a href="Gammarus%20insensibilis">lagoon sand shrimp</a>, <a href="Palaemonetes%20varians">Atlantic ditch shrimp</a>, and <a href="Cerastoderma%20glaucum">lagoon cockle</a>. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the water beetle <a href="Pogonus%20luridipennis">yellow pogonus</a>, and even here it is localised and hard to find.

On exposed parts of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no vegetation except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains <a href="Salicornia">glassworts</a> and <a href="Spartina%20anglica">common cord grass</a> in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first <a href="Aster%20tripolium">sea aster</a>, then mainly <a href="Limonium%20binervosum">sea lavender</a>, with <a href="Halimione%20portulacoides">sea purslane</a> in the creeks and smaller areas of <a href="Plantago%20maritima">sea plantain</a> and other common marsh plants. The uncommon <a href="Ruppia%20cirrhosa">spiral tasselweed</a> and <a href="Carex%20extensa">long-bracted sedge</a> are other lower salt marsh specialists. <a href="Suaeda%20vera">Scrubby sea-blite</a> and <a href="Limonium%20bellidifolium">matted sea lavender</a> are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including <a href="Centaurium%20pulchellum">lesser centaury</a>, <a href="Parapholis%20incurva">curved hard-grass</a> and <a href="Sagina%20maritima">sea pearlwort</a>, with <a href="Ceratophyllum%20submersum">soft hornwort</a> in the dykes.

Grasses such as <a href="Agropyron%20pungens">sea couch grass</a> and <a href="Puccinellia%20maritima">sea poa grass</a> are important in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where <a href="Ammophila%20arenaria">marram grass</a>, <a href="Elymus%20farctus">sand couch-grass</a>, <a href="Leymus%20arenarius">lyme-grass</a> and <a href="Festuca%20rubra">red fescue</a> help to bind the sand. <a href="Eryngium%20maritimum">Sea holly</a> and <a href="Carex%20arenaria">sand sedge</a> are other specialists of this arid habitat, and <a href="Petalophyllum%20ralfsii">petalwort</a> is a nationally rare <a href="bryophyte">bryophyte</a> found on damper dunes. <a href="Lotus%20corniculatus">Bird's-foot trefoil</a>, <a href="pyramidal%20orchid">pyramidal orchid</a>, <a href="Ophrys%20apifera">bee orchid</a> and <a href="Carlina">carline thistle</a> flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter <a href="Goodyera%20repens">creeping lady's tresses</a> and <a href="Monotropa%20hypopitys">yellow bird's nest</a> orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract <a href="Sedum%20acre">biting stonecrop</a>, <a href="Silene%20maritima">sea campion</a>, <a href="Glaucium%20flavum">yellow horned poppy</a>, <a href="Armeria%20maritima">sea thrift</a> and <a href="sea%20beet">sea beet</a>. <a href="Hordeum%20marinum">Sea barley</a> is a scarcer species of this habitat.

The reedbeds, the largest of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are dominated by <a href="Phragmites">common reed</a>, and <a href="Juncus%20gerardii">salt marsh rush</a>, <a href="Ranunculus%20peltatus">brackish water crowfoot</a>, <a href="Bolboschoenus%20maritimus">sea clubrush</a> and <a href="Typha%20latifolia">common bulrush</a> also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have <a href="Juncus%20articulatus">jointleaf rush</a>, <a href="Argentina%20anserina">common silverweed</a>, and less common grasses such as <a href="Polypogon%20monspeliensis">annual beard grass</a>, <a href="Alopecurus%20geniculatus">marsh foxtail</a>, and <a href="Bupleurum%20tenuissimum">slender hare's-ear</a>. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by the nineteenth century and was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for the tens of thousands of geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months.

Scolt Head Island is accessed by a ferry from <a href="Burnham%20Overy">Burnham Overy Staithe</a> which runs between April and September. Blakeney Point can also be reached by boats from <a href="Morston">Morston</a> quay, either to see the seal colonies or to avoid the long walk up the shingle spit from Cley Beach. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point, formerly a <a href="lifeboat%20%28rescue%29">lifeboat</a> station, is open in the summer months.

The rest of the SSSI is close to the A149 coast road, and can be accessed at many points by footpaths or roads. The main nature-orientated facilities are on the major reserves. Holme Dunes NNR is accessed from Holme-next-the-Sea. It has a visitor centre, three <a href="bird%20hide">bird hide</a>s, one of which has disabled access, and a 4 km (2.5 mi) <a href="Educational%20trail">nature trail</a>. The other reserves are all adjacent to the A149. Titchwell Marsh RSPB is just west of <a href="Titchwell">Titchwell</a> village and has a visitor centre, café and hides. Most of the reserve and its facilities are <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a> accessible, but the last part of the footpath to the beach is rough, and crosses a steep bank. The two bird hides at Holkham NNR can be reached from the end of Lady Anne's Drive in Holkham village; there is also a car park further east on Beach Road, Wells-next-the-Sea. Cley Marshes visitor centre and car park are to the south of the A149, opposite the main reserve. The centre and four of the five bird hides are accessible to people with limited mobility.

Their proximity to the main coast road means that the reserves can be accessed by bus as well as car. The <a href="Peddars%20Way">Peddars Way</a> <a href="National%20Trails">National Trail</a> runs the length of the SSSI, and only short sections of this part of the <a href="long%20distance%20footpath">long distance footpath</a> venture south of the SSSI boundary.

A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites (Snettisham, Titchwell, Holkham, Morston Quay, Blakeney and Cley) found that 39 per cent of visitors gave <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a> as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Titchwell Marsh RSPB, Cley Marshes NWT and Holkham NNR each attract 100,000 or more visitors annually.

The small village of Titchwell shows the effect that wildlife visitors can have locally. It adjoins the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh, and a 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent £1.8 million in the area in 1998. The village has two three-star hotels and a shop selling <a href="telescope">telescope</a>s and <a href="binoculars">binoculars</a>, although it does not have a general store or a <a href="public%20house">public house</a>.

The large number of visitors sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers, little terns and common seals, but also wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. Damage is reduced by measures such as wardening breeding colonies, using fences, boardwalks and signs to control access, and appropriate positioning of car parks. The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast into zones for tourism development purposes. Holme dunes, Holkham dunes and Blakeney Point, sensitive habitats suffering from visitor pressure, were designated as red-zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. "Orange" locations had fragile habitats, but were under less tourism pressure, or, as with the large nature reserves, were equipped to cope with many visitors. The most robust sites, mainly outside the SSSI, were placed in the green zone.

The underlying geology of the North Norfolk coast is <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> chalk, exposed at <a href="Hunstanton">Hunstanton</a> cliffs just to the west of the SSSI, but for the entire length of the SSSI coast, the chalk is buried by soft <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> glacial debris. Unlike the rapidly eroding soft cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. This coastline is threatened by <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, with sea level rising an estimated at 1–2 mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.

One of the most vulnerable stretches is that between Blakeney Point and <a href="Weybourne%2C%20Norfolk">Weybourne</a>, which included the Cley and Salthouse Marsh reserves. The coast here is protected by a shingle ridge, but the sea attacks the ridge and spit through tidal and storm action, with a single storm sometimes moving a "spectacular" amount of shingle. The Blakeney Point spit has sometimes been breached, becoming an island for a time, and this may happen again. The northernmost part of nearby <a href="Blakeney%2C%20Norfolk">Blakeney</a> was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages, probably due to a storm. The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1 m (1 yd) per year, and for the last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel was 400 m (440 yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195 m (215 yd) by the end of the 20th century. The landward movement of the shingle means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village. The <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> considered several remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas, and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £1.5 million.

The Environment Agency's long-term policy is to hold the line only to protect communities and infrastructure, with <a href="managed%20retreat">managed retreat</a> as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.

Another strategy is to create new reserves inland. To compensate for the inevitable loss of the important reedbeds at Cley, the Environment Agency and the Norfolk Wildlife Trust have been working since 2010 to make a new wetland near <a href="Hilgay">Hilgay</a>. The Hilgay Wetland Creation Project is converting former farmland into a variety of wetland habitats by using banks, ditches and a lake to manage water levels. The Trust sees this as the first stage of a long-term plan to create a roughly Wissey Living Landscape.

Assassination of Spencer Perceval

<a href="Spencer%20Perceval">Spencer Perceval</a>, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>, was shot and killed in the lobby of the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> in London, at about 5:15 pm on Monday 11 May 1812. His assassin was <a href="John%20Bellingham">John Bellingham</a>, a <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> merchant with a grievance against the government. Bellingham was detained and, four days after the murder, was tried, convicted and sentenced to death. He was hanged at <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a> one week later on 18 May.

Perceval had led the <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> government since 1809, during a critical phase of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. His determination to prosecute the war using the harshest of measures caused widespread poverty and unrest on the home front; thus the news of his death was a cause of rejoicing in the worst affected parts of the country. Despite initial fears that the assassination might be linked to a general uprising, it transpired that Bellingham had acted alone, protesting against the government's failure to compensate him for his treatment a few years previously, when he had been imprisoned in Russia for a trading debt. Bellingham's lack of remorse, and apparent certainty that his action was justified, raised questions about his sanity, but at his trial he was judged to be legally responsible for his actions.

After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous provision to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, and he is generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's hasty trial and execution as contrary to the principles of justice. The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, is the subject of a 2012 study.

Spencer Perceval was born on 1 November 1762, the second son from the second marriage of <a href="John%20Perceval%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Egmont">John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont</a>. He attended <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow School</a> and, in 1780, entered <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he was a noted scholar and prizewinner. A deeply religious boy, at Cambridge he became closely aligned with <a href="evangelicalism">evangelicalism</a>, to which he remained faithful all his life. Under the rule of <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, Perceval had no realistic prospect of a family inheritance, and needed to earn his living; on leaving Cambridge in 1783, he entered <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a> to train as a lawyer. After being <a href="Call%20to%20the%20bar">called to the bar</a> in 1786, Perceval joined the <a href="Circuit%20court%23England%20and%20Wales">Midland Circuit</a>, where his family connections helped him to acquire a lucrative practice. In 1790 he married Jane Wilson, the couple having <a href="elope">elope</a>d on her 21st birthday. The marriage proved happy and prolific; twelve children (six sons and six daughters) were born over the following 14 years.

Perceval's politics were highly conservative, and he acquired a reputation for his attacks on radicalism. As a junior prosecuting counsel in the trials of <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a> and <a href="John%20Horne%20Tooke">John Horne Tooke</a>, he was noticed by senior politicians in the ruling <a href="First%20Pitt%20ministry">Pitt ministry</a>. In 1796, having refused the post of <a href="Chief%20Secretary%20for%20Ireland">Chief Secretary for Ireland</a>, Perceval was elected to parliament as the <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> member for <a href="Northampton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Northampton</a>, and won acclaim in 1798 with a speech defending Pitt's government against attacks by the radicals <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a> and <a href="Francis%20Burdett">Francis Burdett</a>. He was generally seen as a rising star in his party; his short stature and slight build earned him the nickname "Little P".

After <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt's</a> resignation in 1801, Perceval served as <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor General</a>, and then as <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General</a>, in the <a href="Addington%20ministry">Addington ministry</a> of 1801–04, continuing in the latter office through the <a href="Second%20Pitt%20ministry">Pitt ministry</a> of 1804–06. Perceval's deep evangelical convictions led him to his unwavering opposition to the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> and to <a href="Catholic%20emancipation">Catholic emancipation</a>, and his equally fervent support for the abolition of the slave trade, when he worked with fellow evangelicals such as <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a> to secure the passage of the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">Slave Trade Act 1807</a>.

When Pitt died in 1806 his government was succeeded by the cross-party "<a href="Ministry%20of%20All%20the%20Talents">Ministry of All the Talents</a>", under <a href="William%20Grenville%2C%201st%20Baron%20Grenville">Lord Grenville</a>. Perceval remained in opposition during this short-lived ministry, but when the <a href="William%20Cavendish-Bentinck%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Portland">Duke of Portland</a> formed a new Tory administration in March 1807, Perceval took office as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> and <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons">Leader of the House of Commons</a>. Portland was elderly and ailing, and on his resignation in October 1809, Perceval succeeded him as <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Treasury">First Lord of the Treasury</a>—the formal title by which prime ministers were then known—after a wounding internecine leadership struggle. In addition to his duties as head of the government he retained the Chancellorship, largely because he could find no minister of appropriate stature who would accept the office.

Perceval's government was weakened by the refusals to serve of former ministers such as <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a> and <a href="William%20Huskisson">William Huskisson</a>. It faced massive problems at a time of considerable industrial unrest and at a low point in the war against Napoleon. The unsuccessful <a href="Walcheren%20Campaign">Walcheren Campaign</a> in the Netherlands was unravelling, and the army of <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Sir Arthur Wellesley</a>, the future Duke of Wellington, was pinned down in Portugal. At the outset of his ministry Perceval enjoyed the strong support of <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>, but in October 1810 the king lapsed into insanity and was permanently incapacitated. Perceval's relationship with the <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a>, who became <a href="Prince%20Regent">Prince Regent</a>, was initially far less cordial, but in the following months he and Perceval established a reasonable affinity, perhaps motivated in part by the prince's fear that the king might recover and find his favourite statesman deposed.

When the final British forces withdrew from <a href="Walcheren%20Campaign">Walcheren</a> in February 1810, Wellington's force in Portugal was Britain's only military presence on the continent of Europe. Perceval insisted that it stayed there, against the advice of most of his ministers and at great cost to the British exchequer. Ultimately this decision was vindicated, but for the time being his main weapon against Napoleon was the <a href="Orders%20in%20Council%20%281807%29">Orders in Council</a> of 1807, inherited from the previous ministry. These had been issued as a tit-for-tat response to Napoleon's <a href="Continental%20System">Continental System</a>, a measure designed to destroy Britain's overseas trade. The Orders permitted the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> to detain any ship thought to be carrying goods to France or its continental allies. With both warring powers employing similar strategies, world trade shrank, leading to widespread hardship and dissatisfaction in key British industries, particularly textiles and cotton. There were frequent calls for modification or repeal of the Orders, which damaged relations with the United States to the point that, by early 1812, the two nations were on the brink of war.

At home, Perceval upheld his earlier reputation as scourge of radicals, imprisoning Burdett and <a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a>, the latter of whom continued to attack the government from his prison cell. Perceval was also faced with the anti-machine protests known as "<a href="Luddite">Luddism</a>", to which he reacted by introducing a bill making machine-breaking a capital offence; in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> the youthful <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a> called the legislation "barbarous". Despite these difficulties Perceval gradually established his authority, so that in 1811 <a href="Lord%20Liverpool">Lord Liverpool</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War%20and%20the%20Colonies">war minister</a>, observed that the Prime Minister's authority in the House now equalled that of Pitt. Perceval's use of sinecures and other patronage to secure loyalties meant that by May 1812, despite much public protest against his harsh policies, his political position had become unassailable. According to the humorist <a href="Sydney%20Smith">Sydney Smith</a>, Perceval combined "the head of a country parson with the tongue of an Old Bailey lawyer".

Early in 1812 agitation for repeal of the Orders in Council increased. After riots in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> in April, Perceval consented to a House of Commons enquiry into the operation of the Orders; hearings began in May. Perceval was expected to attend the session on 11 May 1812; among the crowd in the lobby awaiting his arrival was a Liverpool merchant, <a href="John%20Bellingham">John Bellingham</a>.

Bellingham was born in about 1770, in the county of <a href="Huntingdonshire">Huntingdonshire</a>. His father, also named John, was a land agent and painted miniatures. His mother Elizabeth was from a well-to-do Huntingdonshire family. In 1779 John senior became mentally ill, and, after confinement in an asylum, died in 1780 or 1781. The family were then provided for by William Daw, Elizabeth's brother-in-law, a prosperous lawyer who arranged Bellingham's appointment as an officer cadet on board the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>'s ship "Hartwell". En route to India the ship mutinied and was wrecked of the coast of the Cape Verde islands; Bellingham survived and returned home. Daw then helped him to set up in business as a tin plate manufacturer in London, but after a few years the business failed, and Bellingham was made bankrupt in 1794. He appears to have escaped debtors' prison, perhaps through the further intervention of Daw. Chastened by this experience, he decided to settle down, and obtained a post as a book-keeper with a firm engaged in trade with Russia. He worked hard, and was sufficiently regarded by his employers to be appointed in 1800 as the firm's resident representative in <a href="Arkhangelsk">Archangel</a>, Russia. On his return home, Bellingham set up his own trading business, and moved to Liverpool. In 1803 he married Mary Neville from <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>.

In 1804 Bellingham returned to Archangel to supervise a major commercial venture, accompanied by Mary and their infant son. His business completed, in November he prepared to return home, but was detained on account of a supposed unpaid debt. This arose from losses incurred by a business associate for which Bellingham was deemed liable. He denied any responsibility for the debt; his detention, he thought, was an act of revenge by powerful Russian merchants who—erroneously—thought that he had frustrated an insurance claim relating to a lost ship. Two arbitrators appointed by the governor of Archangel determined that he was responsible for a sum of 2,000 roubles (about £200), a fraction of the original amount claimed. Bellingham rejected this judgement.

With the issue still unresolved, Bellingham obtained passes for him and his family to travel to the Russian capital, <a href="St%20Petersburg">St Petersburg</a>. In February 1805, as they prepared to set out, Bellingham's pass was revoked; Mary and the child were permitted to proceed, but he was arrested and imprisoned in Archangel. When he sought help from <a href="Granville%20Leveson-Gower%2C%201st%20Earl%20Granville">Lord Granville Leveson-Gower</a>, the British ambassador in St Petersburg, the matter was dealt with by the British consul, Sir Stephen Shairp, who informed Bellingham that as the dispute involved a civil debt, he could not interfere. Bellingham remained in custody in Archangel until November 1805, when a new city governor ordered his release and allowed him to join Mary in St Petersburg. Here, instead of arranging his family's swift return to England, Bellingham laid charges against the Archangel authorities for false imprisonment, and demanded compensation. In doing so he outraged the Russian authorities, who in June 1806 ordered his imprisonment. According to his later account, he was "often marched publicly through the city with gangs of felons and criminals of the worse description [to the] heart-rending humiliation of himself".

Mary had meanwhile returned to England with her son (she was pregnant with her second child), eventually settling in Liverpool where she set up a millinery business with a friend, Mary Stevens. For the next three years Bellingham made constant demands for release and compensation, seeking help from Shairp, Leveson-Gower, and the latter's successor as ambassador, <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton%2C%2010th%20Duke%20of%20Hamilton">Lord Douglas</a>. None were prepared to intercede on his behalf: "Thus", he later wrote when petitioning for redress, "without having offended any law, either civil or criminal, and without having injured any individual ... was your Petitioner bandied from one prison to another". Bellingham's position worsened in 1807, when Russia signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Tilsit">Treaty of Tilsit</a> and aligned itself with Napoleon. Two further years passed before, after a direct petition to <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Tsar Alexander</a>, he was released and ordered to leave Russia. He arrived in England, uncompensated, in December 1809, determined to secure justice.

On his return to England Bellingham spent six months in London, seeking compensation for the imprisonment and financial losses he had suffered in Russia. He considered the British authorities were responsible, through their neglect of his repeated requests for help. Successively he petitioned the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign Office</a>, the <a href="HM%20Treasury">Treasury</a>, the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a>, and Perceval himself; in each case his claims were politely rejected. Defeated and exhausted, in May 1811 Bellingham accepted his wife's ultimatum to abandon his campaign or otherwise lose her and his family. He joined her in Liverpool to begin life afresh.

During the following 18 months, Bellingham worked to rebuild his commercial career, with modest success. Mary continued to work as a milliner. The fact that he remained uncompensated continued to rankle. In December 1811 he returned to London, ostensibly to conduct business there, but in reality to resume his campaign for redress. He petitioned the <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince Regent</a>, before resuming his efforts with the Privy Council, the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> and the Treasury, only to receive the same polite refusals as before. He then sent a copy of his petition to every member of parliament, again to no avail. On 23 March 1812, he wrote to the magistrates at <a href="Bow%20Street%20Magistrates%27%20Court">Bow Street Magistrates' Court</a>, arguing that the government had "completely endeavoured to close the door of justice", and asking the court to intervene. He received a perfunctory reply. After consulting his own MP, <a href="Isaac%20Gascoyne">Isaac Gascoyne</a>, Bellingham made a final attempt to present his case to the government. On 18 April, he met with a Treasury official, Mr Hill, to whom he said that if he could get no satisfaction, he would take justice into his own hands. Hill, not perceiving these words as a threat, told him he should take whatever action he deemed proper. On 20 April, Bellingham purchased two .50 calibre (12.7 mm) pistols from a gunsmith of 58 Skinner Street. He also had a <a href="tailor">tailor</a> sew an inside pocket to his coat.

Bellingham's presence in the House of Commons lobby on Monday 11 May, caused no particular suspicion; he had made several recent visits, sometimes asking journalists to confirm specific ministers' identities. Bellingham's activities earlier that day did not overtly indicate a man preparing desperate measures. He had spent the morning writing letters and visiting his wife's business partner, Mary Stevens, who was in London at the time. In the afternoon he had accompanied his landlady and her son on a visit to the European Museum, in the <a href="St%20James%27s">St James's</a> district of London. From there he made his way alone to the parliament buildings in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, arriving in the lobby shortly before five o'clock.

In the House, as the session began at 4:30 pm, the <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> MP <a href="Henry%20Brougham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brougham%20and%20Vaux">Henry Brougham</a>, a leading opponent of the Orders, drew attention to the Prime Minister's absence and remarked that he ought to be there. A messenger was sent to fetch Perceval from Downing Street, but met him in <a href="Whitehall">Parliament Street</a> (Perceval having decided to walk and dispense with his usual carriage) on his way to the House, where he arrived at about 5:15. As Perceval entered the lobby, he was confronted by Bellingham who, drawing a pistol, shot the Prime Minister in the chest. Perceval staggered forward a few steps and exclaimed "I am murdered!" before falling face down at the feet of <a href="William%20Smith%20%28abolitionist%29">William Smith</a>, the MP for <a href="Norwich%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Norwich</a>. (It was also variously reported Perceval had said "Murder" or "Oh my God".) Smith only realised that the victim was Perceval when he turned the body face upwards. By the time he had been carried into an adjoining room and propped up on a table with his feet on two chairs, he was senseless, although there was still a faint pulse. When a surgeon arrived a few minutes later, the pulse had stopped, and Perceval was declared dead.

In the pandemonium that followed, Bellingham sat quietly on a bench as Perceval was carried into the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Speaker's</a> quarters. In the lobby, such was the confusion that, according to a witness, had Bellingham "walked quietly out into the street, he would have escaped, and the committer of the murder would never have been known". As it was, an official who had seen the shooting identified Bellingham, who was seized, disarmed, manhandled and searched. He remained calm, submitting to his captors without a struggle. When asked to explain his actions, he replied that he was rectifying a denial of justice on the part of the government.

The Speaker ordered that Bellingham be transferred to the <a href="Serjeant-at-Arms%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Serjeant-at-Arms's</a> quarters, where MPs who were also magistrates would conduct a committal hearing under the chairmanship of <a href="Harvey%20Christian%20Combe">Harvey Christian Combe</a>. The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime, and sent messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings. The prisoner kept his composure throughout; although warned against self-incrimination, he insisted on explaining himself: "I have been ill-treated ... I have sought redress in vain. I am a most unfortunate man and feel here"—placing hand on heart—"sufficient justification for what I have done." He had, he said, exhausted all proper avenues, and had made it clear to the authorities that he proposed to take independent action. He had been told to do his worst: "I have obeyed them. I have done my worst, and I rejoice in the deed." At around eight o'clock, Bellingham was formally charged with Perceval's murder, and was committed to <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a> to await trial.

Reports of the assassination spread quickly; in his history of the times, <a href="Arthur%20Bryant">Arthur Bryant</a> records the crude delight with which the news was received by hungry workers who had received nothing but woe from Perceval's government. In his prison cell, Cobbett understood their feelings; the shooting had "ridded them of one whom they looked upon as the leader among those whom they thought totally bent on the destruction of their liberties". The scenes outside the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> as Bellingham was taken out for transfer to Newgate were consistent with this mood; <a href="Samuel%20Romilly">Samuel Romilly</a>, the law reformer and MP for <a href="Wareham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Wareham</a>, heard from the assembled crowd "the most savage expressions of joy and exultation ... accompanied with regret that others, and particularly the attorney general, had not shared the same fate". The throng surged around the <a href="Hackney%20carriage">hackney coach</a> carrying Bellingham; many tried to shake his hand, others mounted the coach-box and had to be beaten off with whips. He was hustled back into the building, and kept there until the disorder had died down sufficiently for him to be moved, with a full military escort.

Among the governing classes there were initial fears that the assassination might be part of a general insurrection, or might spark one. The authorities took precautions; the <a href="Foot%20Guards%23British%20Army">Foot Guards</a> and <a href="Household%20Cavalry">mounted troops</a> were deployed, as was the City militia, while <a href="Parish%20constable">local watches</a> were reinforced. In contrast to the public's evident approval of Bellingham's actions, the mood among Perceval's friends and colleagues was sombre and sorrowful. When parliament met the next day, <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a> spoke of "a man ... of whom it might with particular truth be said that, whatever was the strength of political hostility, he had never before that last calamity provoked a single enemy". After further tributes from government and opposition members, the House moved a grant of £50,000 and an annuity of £2,000 to Perceval's widow, which provision, slightly amended, was approved in June.

The regard in which Perceval was held by his peers was made evident in an anonymous 1812 poem, "Universal Sympathy, "or", The Martyr'd Statesman":

An inquest into Perceval's death was held on 12 May, at the Rose and Crown public house in Downing Street. Among those who gave evidence were Gascoyne, Smith, and <a href="Joseph%20Hume">Joseph Hume</a>, a doctor and <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radical</a> MP. He had helped to detain Bellingham, and now testified that from his controlled behaviour after the shooting, Bellingham appeared "perfectly sane". The coroner duly registered the cause of death as "wilful murder by John Bellingham". Armed with this verdict the Attorney General, <a href="Vicary%20Gibbs">Sir Vicary Gibbs</a>, requested the <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Lord Chief Justice</a> to arrange the earliest possible trial date.

In Newgate prison, Bellingham was questioned by magistrates. His calm demeanour and poise led them, unlike Hume, to doubt his sanity, although his keepers had observed no signs of unbalanced behaviour. <a href="James%20Harmer">James Harmer</a>, Bellingham's solicitor, knew that insanity would provide the only conceivable defence for his client, and despatched agents to Liverpool to make enquiries there. While awaiting their reports he learned from an informant that Bellingham's father had died insane; he also heard evidence of Bellingham's supposed derangement from Ann Billett, the prisoner's cousin, who had known him from childhood. On 14 May, a grand jury met in the Sessions House, <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>, and after hearing evidence from the eyewitnesses, found "a true Bill against John Bellingham for the murder of Spencer Perceval". The trial was arranged to take place the next day, Friday 15 May 1812, at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>.

When Bellingham received news of his forthcoming trial he asked Harmer to arrange for him to be represented in court by Brougham and Peter Alley, the latter an Irish lawyer with a reputation for flamboyance. Confident of his acquittal, Bellingham refused to discuss the case further with Harmer, and spent the afternoon and evening making notes. After drinking a glass of <a href="Porter%20%28beer%29">porter</a>, he went to bed and slept soundly.

The trial began at the Old Bailey on Friday 15 May 1812, under the presiding judge <a href="James%20Mansfield">Sir James Mansfield</a>, Chief Justice of the <a href="Court%20of%20Common%20Pleas">Court of Common Pleas</a>. The prosecuting team was led by the Attorney General, Gibbs, whose assistants included <a href="William%20Garrow">William Garrow</a>, himself a future Attorney General. Brougham having declined, Bellingham was represented by Alley, assisted by Henry Revell Reynolds. The law at that time limited the role of defending counsel in capital cases; they could advise on points of law, and could examine and cross-examine witnesses, but otherwise Bellingham would have to present his own defence.

After Bellingham had entered a not guilty plea, Alley asked for a postponement to allow him time to locate witnesses who could attest to the prisoner's insanity. This was opposed by Gibbs as a mere ploy to delay justice; Mansfield concurred, and the trial proceeded. Gibbs then summarised the prisoner's business activities before meeting misfortune in Russia—"whether through his own misconduct or by the justice or injustice of that country, I know not". He recounted Bellingham's unsuccessful efforts to obtain redress, and the consequent growth of a desire for revenge.

Having described the shooting, Gibbs dismissed the possibility of insanity, maintaining that Bellingham was, at the time of the deed, fully in control of his actions. Numerous eyewitnesses testified to what they had seen in the Commons lobby. The court also heard from a tailor who, shortly before the attack had, on Bellingham's instructions, modified the latter's coat by adding a special inside pocket, in which Bellingham had concealed his pistols.

When Bellingham rose, he thanked the attorney general for rejecting the "insanity" strategy: "I think it is far more fortunate that such a plea ... should have been unfounded, than it should have existed in fact". He began his defence by asserting that "all the miseries which it is possible for human nature to endure" had fallen on him. He then read the petition that he had sent to the Prince Regent, and recalled his fruitless dealings with various government agencies. In his view the principal blame lay not with "that truly amiable and highly lamented individual, Mr Perceval", but with Leveson-Gower, the ambassador in St Petersburg who he felt had originally denied him justice, and who he said deserved the shot rather than the eventual victim.

Bellingham's main witnesses were Ann Billett and her friend, Mary Clarke, both of whom testified to his history of derangement, and Catherine Figgins, a servant in Bellingham's lodgings. She had found him recently confused, but otherwise an honest and admirable lodger. As she stood down, Alley informed the court that two more witnesses had arrived from Liverpool. However, when they saw Bellingham, they realised that he was not the man to whose derangement they had come to attest, and withdrew. Mansfield then began his summing up, during the course of which he clarified the law: "The single question is whether at the time this act was committed, he possessed a sufficient degree of understanding to distinguish good from evil, right from wrong". The judge advised the jury before they retired that the evidence showed Bellingham to be "in every respect a full and competent judge of all his actions".

The jury retired, and within 15 minutes returned with a guilty verdict. Bellingham appeared surprised but, from Thomas Hodgson's contemporary trial account, was calm, "with[out] any demonstrations of that concern which the awfulness of his situation was calculate to produce". Asked by the court clerk if he had anything to say, he remained silent.

The clerk then read the sentence, Hodgson records, "in a most solemn and affecting manner, which bathed many of the auditors in tears". First, he damned the crime, "as odious and abominable in the eyes of God as it is hateful and abhorrent to the feelings of man". He reminded the prisoner of the short time, "a very short time", that remained for him to seek for mercy in another world, and then pronounced the sentence of death itself: "You shall be hanged by the neck until you be dead, your body to be dissected and anatomized". The entire trial had lasted less than eight hours.

Bellingham's execution was fixed for the morning of Monday 18 May. The day before, he was visited by <a href="Daniel%20Wilson%20%28bishop%29">the Revd Daniel Wilson</a>, curate at <a href="St%20John%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Bedford%20Row">St John's Chapel, Bedford Row</a>, a future <a href="Diocese%20of%20Calcutta%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20North%20India">Bishop of Calcutta</a>, who hoped that Bellingham would show true repentance for his act. The clergyman was disappointed, concluding that "a more dreadful instance of depravity and hardness of heart has surely never occurred". Late on Sunday, Bellingham wrote a last letter to his wife, in which he appeared confident of his soul's destination: "Nine hours more will waft me to those happy shores where bliss is without alloy".

Large crowds gathered outside Newgate on Monday; a force of troops stood by, since warnings had been received of a "Rescue Bellingham" movement. The crowd was calm and restrained, as was Bellingham when he appeared at the scaffold shortly before 8 o'clock. Hodgson records that Bellingham mounted the steps "with the utmost celerity ... his tread was bold and firm ... no indication of trembling, faltering, or irresolution appeared". Bellingham was then blindfolded, the rope fastened, and a final prayer was said by the chaplain. As the clock struck eight the trap door was released, and Bellingham dropped to his death. Cobbett, still incarcerated in Newgate, observed the crowd's reactions: "anxious looks ... half-horrified countenances ... mournful tears ... unanimous blessings". In accordance with the court's sentence, the body was cut down and sent to <a href="St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Hospital">St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> for dissection. In what the press described as "morbid sensationalism", Bellingham's clothes were sold for high prices to members of the public.

On 15 May, the House of Commons voted for the erection of a monument to the assassinated Prime Minister in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Later, memorials were placed in Lincoln's Inn, and within Perceval's Northampton constituency.

On 8 June, the Regent appointed Lord Liverpool to head a new Tory administration. Despite their eulogies to their fallen leader, members of the new government soon began to distance themselves from his ministry. Many of the changes that Perceval had opposed were gradually introduced: greater press freedom, Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. The Orders in Council were repealed on 23 June, but too late to avoid the <a href="War%20of%201812">declaration of war on the United Kingdom by the United States</a>. Lord Liverpool's government did not maintain Perceval's resolution in acting against the illegal slave trade, which began to flourish as the authorities looked the other way. Linklater estimates that around 40,000 slaves were illegally transported from Africa to the West Indies, because of lax enforcement of the law.

Linklater cites Perceval's greatest achievement as his insistence on keeping Wellington's army in the field, a policy which helped to turn the tide in the Napoleonic Wars decisively in Britain's favour. Despite this, with the passage of time Perceval's reputation faded; <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> considered him "a third-rate politician scarcely fit to carry Lord Chatham's crutch". In due course, little but the fact of his assassination lingered in public memory. As the bicentenary of the shooting approached, Perceval was described in newspapers as "the prime minister that history forgot".

The justice of Bellingham's conviction was first questioned by Brougham, who condemned the trial as "the greatest disgrace to English justice". In a study published in 2004 the American academic Kathleen S. Goddard criticises the timing of the trial so soon after the act, when passions were running high. She also draws attention to the court's refusal to allow an adjournment that would permit the defence to contact possible witnesses. There was, she maintains, insufficient evidence produced at the trial to determine the true state of Bellingham's sanity, and Mansfield's summing-up showed significant bias. Bellingham's claim to have acted alone was accepted in court; Linklater's 2012 study posits that he could been an agent of other interests—perhaps Liverpool merchants, who bore the main brunt of Perceval's economic policies and had much to gain by his demise. Comments by a Liverpool newspaper, says Linklater, indicate that talk of assassination was common in the city. It remains unknown how Bellingham gained the funds to spend freely in the months preceding the assassination, when he was not apparently engaged in any business. This conspiracy theory has not convinced other historians; the columnist <a href="Bruce%20Anderson%20%28columnist%29">Bruce Anderson</a> points to the lack of any concrete evidence to support it.

In the months immediately following her husband's execution, Mary Bellingham continued to live and work in Liverpool. By the end of 1812 her business had failed, and thereafter her movements are obscure; she may have reverted to her maiden name. In January 1815, Jane Perceval married <a href="Sir%20Henry%20William%20Carr">Sir Henry William Carr</a>; she died, aged 74, in 1844.

In 1828, "The Times" reported that Cornish industrialist landowner, John Williams the Third (1753–1841) received a dream warning of Perceval's assassination on 2 or 3 May 1812, nearly ten days before the event, "correct in every detail". Perceval himself had a series of dreams culminating on 10 May with one of his own death, which he had while spending the night at the house of the <a href="Dudley%20Ryder%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Harrowby">Earl of Harrowby</a>. He told the Earl of his dream, and the Earl tried to persuade Perceval not to attend Parliament that day, but Perceval refused to be scared off by "a mere dream" and headed for Westminster on the afternoon of 11 May.

A distant kinsman of the assassin, <a href="Henry%20Bellingham%20%28Norfolk%20MP%29">Henry Bellingham</a>, became <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> MP for <a href="North%20West%20Norfolk%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North West Norfolk</a> in 1983, and held junior office in the <a href="Cameron%E2%80%93Clegg%20coalition">Cameron–Clegg coalition</a> of 2010–15. When he temporarily lost his seat in 1997—he regained it in 2001—his narrow defeat was widely regarded as arising from the intervention of Roger Percival, the candidate for the <a href="Referendum%20Party">Referendum Party</a> whose votes largely came from disgruntled Conservatives. Despite the different spelling, media accounts asserted Percival's descent from the assassinated Prime Minister's family, and reported the defeat as a belated form of revenge.

The greater part of the Palace of Westminster (<a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a> apart) that stood at the time of the assassination was destroyed by <a href="Burning%20of%20Parliament">an accidental fire</a> in 1834, following which the Houses were comprehensively rebuilt and expanded.
In July 2014, a brass memorial plaque was unveiled in St Stephen's Hall, Houses of Parliament, close to the place where Perceval was killed. <a href="Michael%20Ellis%20%28British%20politician%29">Michael Ellis</a>, Conservative MP for <a href="Northampton%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Northampton North</a> (part of Perceval's old Northampton constituency) had campaigned for the plaque after four patterned floor tiles that were said to mark the spot had been removed by workmen in a recent renovation.

History of Liverpool F.C. (1892–1959)

The history of <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool Football Club</a> from 1892 to 1959 covers the period from the club's foundation, through their first period of success from 1900 to the 1920s, to the appointment of <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> as <a href="List%20of%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20managers">manager</a>.

Liverpool Football Club was formed on 15 March 1892 following a disagreement between the directors of <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton Football Club</a> and its president, <a href="John%20Houlding">John Houlding</a>, who owned the club's ground, <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>. A dispute over rent resulted in Everton moving to <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Thus, he founded Liverpool F.C., and they joined the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29">Lancashire League</a>. After winning the league title in their <a href="1892%E2%80%9393%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">first season</a>, Liverpool were accepted into <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> for the <a href="1893%E2%80%9394%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1893–94 season</a>, following the resignations of <a href="Accrington%20F.C.">Accrington</a> and <a href="Bootle%20F.C.%20%281879%29">Bootle</a>.

The appointment of <a href="Tom%20Watson%20%28football%20manager%29">Tom Watson</a> as the club's manager in 1896 led to the club's first period of sustained success. Liverpool consolidated their position in the Football League following <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, and won their first League championship in 1901. A further championship followed in 1906, and in 1914 the club reached their first <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> final, losing to <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>. Watson died suddenly in 1915 of pneumonia after the outbreak of the First World War. The club won two further championships in 1922 and 1923 when football resumed after the war.

An expansion to the <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadiums%29">Spion Kop</a> terracing in the 1920s increased Anfield's capacity. Liverpool's fortunes declined during the inter-war years, when the club often finished in midtable. Liverpool became League champions again in 1947, in the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Football%20League">first season</a> after the Second World War, but following a slow downturn in performance the club was relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in 1954. By the time of Shankly's appointment in 1959, Liverpool had been in the Second Division for five seasons.

Liverpool's origins lie with their neighbours <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. Founded in 1878, Everton moved to <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> in 1884, a facility owned by the club's president, John Houlding, a former <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Liverpool">Lord Mayor of Liverpool</a>. In 1892 a dispute arose between Houlding and the Everton board of directors, over the club's tenancy of the ground. The annual rent had risen from £100 in 1884 to £250 in 1892; Houlding wanted to sell the ground to the club, which in turn wished to agree a long-term rental. Houlding would only agree to this on the basis of a rent at a level unacceptable to the club. Negotiations having failed, the directors decided to leave Anfield and find another ground, leaving Houlding with an empty stadium. His response was to form a new football club to occupy the stadium. He attempted to retain the team name "Everton" by registering the name "Everton Football Club and Athletic Grounds Company, Limited" with <a href="Companies%20House">Companies House</a>, but the Football League decided that the name belonged to the departed Everton club, which acquired new premises at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>. Houlding therefore adopted the name "Liverpool Football Club" for his new venture.

Having established his new club, Houlding applied for membership of the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> of <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>, rather than the newly formed <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. The League, unimpressed with this premature application, refused to admit the club, which instead joined the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29">Lancashire League</a>. Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly match</a> against <a href="Rotherham%20Town%20F.C.%20%281878%29">Rotherham Town</a>, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players – <a href="List%20of%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20managers">manager</a> <a href="John%20McKenna">John McKenna</a> had recruited the players after a <a href="Scout%20%28sport%29">scouting</a> trip to Scotland – so they became known as the "team of Macs". Liverpool's first match in the Lancashire League, which they won 8–0, was against Higher Walton. 200 spectators attended the match, but as the <a href="1892%E2%80%9393%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">twenty-two match season</a> proceeded, and Liverpool continued to win, attendances increased. Approximately 2,000 people watched Liverpool defeat South Shore in the penultimate match of the season at Anfield.

Liverpool's first season was successful, as the club narrowly won the Lancashire League title on <a href="goal%20difference">goal average</a>, over <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a>. They also won the Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton. The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £130 to replace them. Following their success, Liverpool reapplied to the Football League. This application was successful, mainly because of the resignations of <a href="Accrington%20F.C.">Accrington</a> and <a href="Bootle%20F.C.%20%281879%29">Bootle</a> from the Second Division. Liverpool's original <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">strip</a> had been blue and white chequered shirts and white shorts, similar to those of their neighbours Everton. From 1894 they changed to red shirts and white shorts.

The club's first match in the Football League was against <a href="Middlesbrough%20Ironopolis%20F.C.">Middlesbrough Ironopolis</a> on 2 September 1893, which they won 2–0, with <a href="Malcolm%20McVean">Malcolm McVean</a> scoring Liverpool's first goal in League football. <a href="1893%E2%80%9394%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">Liverpool's first season in the Football League</a> saw them unbeaten in 28 matches, 22 of which they won. They finished at the top of the Second Division, but as at that time there was no automatic <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the First Division, they were entered into the <a href="Playoffs%23Association%20football">test match system</a>. This involved a knockout match with the bottom team in the First Division, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Newton Heath</a> (later renamed Manchester United). Liverpool won, and took their place in the First Division. Their stay in the division lasted only a season, as they finished in bottom position, with seven wins from thirty matches. They were relegated to the Second Division, after facing <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a> in the test match and losing 1–0, despite Bury playing most of the match with ten men after their <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> was <a href="Fouls%20and%20misconduct%20%28association%20football%29">sent off</a>.

As more people began to watch Liverpool, the ground capacity was expanded. The Main Stand was built, which helped to bring regular attendances of around 20,000. Liverpool's stay in the Second Division was brief, as they secured promotion to the First Division during the <a href="1895%E2%80%9396%20Football%20League">1895–96 season</a> – twelve wins in their final fourteen matches gave them a first-place finish, followed by success in the test matches over <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Small Heath</a> (later renamed Birmingham City) and <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. The club reached the semi-final of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in the <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1896–97 season</a>; they were drawn against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, and with Everton in the other semi-final, there was the prospect of a first all-<a href="Merseyside">Merseyside</a> cup final. However, while Everton won their tie, Liverpool were defeated 3–0. After winning promotion, the club appointed <a href="Tom%20Watson%20%28football%20manager%29">Tom Watson</a>, who was managing <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, as their new manager. Watson's record of three League championships in four seasons with Sunderland convinced Houlding to make Watson the highest-paid manager in England, with a yearly salary of £300.

During the next two seasons Liverpool consolidated their place in the First Division, with fifth and ninth-place finishes. Performances improved in the <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20Football%20League">1898–99 season</a>, when the club went into their final game with a chance of winning their first League championship. They faced Aston Villa, with whom they were level on points, although Villa's goal average advantage of 0.02 meant that they only needed to draw the match to win the League title. In the event, Villa won 5–0, to leave Liverpool as the runners-up. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi-final, where they faced <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>. The match finished in a 2–2 draw; the first <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a> at <a href="Burnden%20Park">Burnden Park</a> also finished with the sides equal at 4–4, and a second replay at the small <a href="Fallowfield%20Stadium">Fallowfield Stadium</a> was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch. The tie was finally decided at the <a href="Baseball%20Ground">Baseball Ground</a>, which Sheffield United won 1–0.

Liverpool won their first League championship in 1901. Integral to their success were their <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> <a href="Alex%20Raisbeck">Alex Raisbeck</a>, and <a href="striker%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> <a href="Sam%20Raybould">Sam Raybould</a>. Raisbeck, a <a href="centre-half">centre-half</a>, had been signed from <a href="Hibernian%20F.C.">Hibernian</a> in 1898. He became club captain a year later, and was often the focal point of the team, as an important defensive player and the instigator of many of Liverpool's attacks. Raybould was signed from local club <a href="New%20Brighton%20Tower%20F.C.">New Brighton Tower</a>, and in the <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20Football%20League">1899–1900 season</a> scored seven times as the club won nine of their last eleven matches, to finish in tenth place. He would go on to score 128 goals in 226 matches for Liverpool. Success in the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20Football%20League">1900–01 season</a> looked unlikely in February, at which point Liverpool had lost eight games and conceded 31 goals. However, they won nine and drew three of their next twelve matches, while only conceding four goals, to achieve their first League title. They were less successful in the following two seasons, finishing in eleventh and fifth places respectively. The <a href="1903%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League">1903–04 season</a> saw the club relegated to the Second Division; like the previous relegation it was only for one year as they won the division the <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20Football%20League">following season</a>. On their return in the <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20Football%20League">1905–06 season</a> they became the first team to win the Second and First Division in successive seasons. They also reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, where they faced Everton and lost 2–0.

Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the ownership of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family. The club owed a debt of £10,000 to Houlding, and a further £5,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by his family. The family offered to give up the 2,000 shares and wipe out the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee. The board agreed, and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each. Following the share issue, McKenna became chairman of the club.

Following the club's successes, a new stand was erected along the Walton Breck Road end of the ground. The stand became known as the <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadia%29">Spion Kop</a> – it was originally given this name by local journalist Ernest Edwards, the sports editor of the "<a href="Liverpool%20Daily%20Post">Liverpool Daily Post</a>" and the "<a href="Liverpool%20Echo">Echo</a>", after a <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28mountain%29">famous hill</a> in South Africa, where <a href="Battle%20of%20Spion%20Kop">a local regiment had suffered heavy losses</a> during the <a href="Boer%20War">Boer War</a>. More than 300 men had died, many of them from <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop.

In the seasons following their second league title, Liverpool enjoyed limited success, generally finishing in midtable. They finished in second place behind Aston Villa in the <a href="1909%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League">1909–10 season</a>, the last for their captain, Raisbeck, who returned to his native Scotland to play for <a href="Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.">Partick Thistle</a>. Liverpool's form declined after his departure, with their best performance in the League a 12th-place finish in the <a href="1912%E2%80%9313%20Football%20League">1912–13 season</a>. There was improvement in 1914 when the club reached their first FA Cup final, which they lost <a href="1914%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1–0</a> to <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace</a>.The following season four Liverpool players were implicated in the <a href="1915%20British%20football%20betting%20scandal">1915 British football betting scandal</a>, which involved a match with Manchester United. A 2–0 victory for United was required to win the bet, in which players from both sides were involved. With the score at 2–0, Liverpool's <a href="Fred%20Pagnam">Fred Pagnam</a> hit the crossbar with a shot, at which several of his teammates gestured angrily towards him. Subsequently, <a href="Tom%20Fairfoul">Tom Fairfoul</a>, <a href="Tom%20Miller%20%28footballer%29">Tom Miller</a>, <a href="Bob%20Pursell%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201889%29">Bob Pursell</a> and <a href="Jackie%20Sheldon">Jackie Sheldon</a> were found guilty by a <a href="Football%20Association">Football Association</a> (FA) enquiry of conspiring with three Manchester United players (<a href="Sandy%20Turnbull">Sandy Turnbull</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Whalley">Arthur Whalley</a> and <a href="Enoch%20West">Enoch West</a>) to <a href="Match%20fixing">fix</a> a United win. All the players involved were banned for life. Following the end of the First World War, in which Turnbull was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a> in 1917, the FA lifted the surviving players' bans in recognition of their service in the conflict.

Three weeks after visiting his hometown of <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a> to celebrate his 56th birthday, Liverpool's manager Tom Watson developed a severe chill, which developed into <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. He died on 6 May 1915; Raisbeck and two other former Liverpool stars, <a href="Ned%20Doig">Ned Doig</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Goddard%20%28footballer%29">Arthur Goddard</a>, were pallbearers at the funeral.

During the First World War, with normal Football League activity suspended, Liverpool competed in a regional league, the Lancashire Section. The competition was split into two parts: "Principal Tournament" and the "Supplementary Competition". Liverpool won the former in the <a href="1916%E2%80%9317%20in%20English%20football">1916–17 season</a>, and the latter in the <a href="1917%E2%80%9318%20in%20English%20football">1917–18</a> and <a href="1918%E2%80%9319%20in%20English%20football">1918–19 seasons</a>. A number of Liverpool players fought in the war, including <a href="Philip%20Bratley">Philip Bratley</a>, <a href="Robert%20Crawford%20%28footballer%29">Robert Crawford</a> and <a href="Wilfred%20Bartrop">Wilfred Bartrop</a>. Bartrop was the only one to be killed, dying on 7 November 1918 while fighting in Belgium.

When football resumed after the war for the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League">1919–20 season</a>, Watson's post as manager was taken by <a href="David%20Ashworth">David Ashworth</a>. Liverpool finished in fourth place. During the season <a href="George%20V">George V</a> became the first reigning monarch to watch a League match, when Liverpool played <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Liverpool repeated their fourth-place finish in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Football%20League">1920–21</a>. Another Scottish defender, <a href="Donald%20McKinlay">Donald McKinlay</a>, was given the captaincy from January 1922 to 1928. Liverpool regained the League championship in the <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20Football%20League">1921–22 season</a>. Liverpool had looked certain title winners, before the loss of three of their last six games put their chances in doubt. A 4–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the last match of the season was enough to secure Liverpool's third League championship.

Ashworth left Liverpool midway through the following season, to manage <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a> – he wished to be closer to his wife and daughter, who lived in nearby <a href="Stockport">Stockport</a>. His replacement was the former Liverpool player <a href="Matt%20McQueen">Matt McQueen</a>, a club director. McQueen was intended as a temporary appointment, but he kept the job as Liverpool retained the League championship. This success owed much to the form of their goalkeeper <a href="Elisha%20Scott">Elisha Scott</a>, who conceded only 31 goals during the season, a league record at the time. Liverpool's total of 60 points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier. <a href="Harry%20Chambers">Harry Chambers</a> top scored in the first four post World War 1 seasons including the two title wins.

Following their successive championships, Liverpool's fortunes declined as their side aged. Some of the players had begun their careers before the war; goalkeeper Scott had been in the side since 1912. The club began the <a href="1923%E2%80%9324%20Football%20League">1923–24 season</a> aiming to win three league titles in a row, but finished in twelfth place. They achieved fourth place the following season, which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War. Changes to the <a href="offside%20%28association%20football%29">offside rule</a> in the <a href="1925%E2%80%9326%20Football%20League">1925–26 season</a> resulted in an increase in the number of goals scored during matches. Liverpool contributed to this, with big victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United, but could only manage a seventh-place finish.

In 1920, the Kop had been redesigned and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all standing. At the time, the Kop was the biggest football stand in the country, able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds. The increase in spectators did not fully restore Liverpool's fortunes; they scored 90 goals during the <a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20Football%20League">1928–29 season</a>, striker <a href="Gordon%20Hodgson">Gordon Hodgson</a> scoring thirty of them, yet finished in fifth place. McQueen was unable to replicate his early triumphs with the club, and retired in 1928 after his leg was amputated following a road accident. He was replaced as manager by club secretary <a href="George%20Patterson%20%28football%29">George Patterson</a>. The club's fortunes did not improve under Patterson's leadership; they generally finished midtable. Their results were inconsistent; in September 1930, they lost 7–0 at <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>, yet nine days later they beat <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> 7–2 at Anfield.

During the 1930s Liverpool's form continued to deteriorate, and they avoided relegation in the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20Football%20League">1933–34 season</a> by only four points. Scott left the club at the end of what had been a poor season for the veteran goalkeeper. In ten matches from the start of 1934, Liverpool won only once with Scott in goal, and after a 9–2 defeat against Newcastle United, he was replaced by <a href="Arthur%20Riley">Arthur Riley</a>. The change of goalkeepers brought an upturn in form, with a 6–2 victory over Birmingham City and a 4–1 win against <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>. Scott, who joined <a href="Belfast%20Celtic%20F.C.">Belfast Celtic</a> after 24 years at Liverpool, remains the club's longest-serving player. As they became used to finishing in the lower part of the league table, Liverpool began to lose their best players. Hodgson, who had scored 233 goals in 358 league games, was sold to Aston Villa in 1936 and the club struggled to replace him. They finished 19th in the season following his departure. Also in 1936, Patterson resigned as manager for health reasons, and resumed his role as the club's secretary. His replacement, <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> manager <a href="George%20Kay">George Kay</a>, did not initially fare much better; Liverpool narrowly avoided relegation in the <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20Football%20League">1936–37 season</a>, and finished in 11th place in each of the following two seasons. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Liverpool had become accustomed to finishing midtable.

Soon after the outbreak of war in 1939, the <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20in%20English%20football">1939–40 season</a> was cancelled and all first-class football in Britain temporarily suspended. When matches resumed, competitions were played on a regional basis as in the previous war, and teams often did not complete a full season. Liverpool participated in the <a href="Football%20League%20North%20and%20South">Football League North</a>, which they won in the <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20in%20English%20football">1942–43 season</a>. Many footballers served in the armed forces, away from their clubs for long periods, and would often appear as "guests" for other clubs. Two Liverpool players were decorated for their wartime service; <a href="Berry%20Nieuwenhuys">Berry Nieuwenhuys</a> received the Czech Medal of Merit, and <a href="Bill%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201921%29">Bill Jones</a> was awarded the <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a> after rescuing wounded comrades under fire.

League football in England resumed in the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Football%20League">1946–47 season</a>, after seven seasons' suspension due to the war. Before the resumption, Liverpool embarked on an eight-week tour of the United States and Canada, scoring 70 goals in the ten matches played. In escaping from post-war food rationing while on tour, the Liverpool players were able to eat more, and by the end of the trip had gained in weight an average of a man. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reporter who followed the team on the tour noted the "perceptible gain in strength on the playing field."

The first game played at Anfield after the war was against Middlesbrough, on 4 September 1946, which Liverpool lost 1–0 before a crowd of 34,140. Despite this defeat, Liverpool finished the 1946–47 season as League champions captained again by a Scot, <a href="Willie%20Fagan">Willie Fagan</a>. Vital to this success were their attacking players; after a 5–0 defeat to Manchester United the club bought <a href="Albert%20Stubbins">Albert Stubbins</a> from Newcastle United, to augment the attack alongside <a href="Jack%20Balmer">Jack Balmer</a> and <a href="Billy%20Liddell">Billy Liddell</a>. Stubbins and Balmer joined top scpred with 24 league goals and Balmer scoring <a href="hat-trick%23Association%20football">hat-tricks</a> in three successive matches.

The club were unable to match this success in the two seasons that followed, and finished in 11th and 12th places respectively. The <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20Football%20League">1949–50 season</a> brought another disappointing league campaign. The season started well, as the club was unbeaten in their first 19 matches and was top of the league at the turn of the year. Their form declined thereafter, and they finished eighth. This did not hinder their progress in the FA Cup, as they reached their second final (their first at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>), against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. They were unable to win their first FA Cup; two goals from Arsenal striker <a href="Reg%20Lewis">Reg Lewis</a> meant Liverpool lost <a href="1950%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2–0</a>.

After their FA Cup final appearance, Liverpool's fortunes declined steadily. Kay resigned through ill-health, and was replaced by <a href="Don%20Welsh">Don Welsh</a>. Welsh's first season did not go smoothly, as Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> of the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a>. The following year, 61,905 spectators watched Liverpool beat <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> 2–1 in the fourth round of the FA Cup, the biggest attendance ever recorded at Anfield. Under Welsh's stewardship the club gradually slipped further down the table, and were relegated to the Second Division in the <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Football%20League">1953–54 season</a>, after finishing in bottom place. Their relegation came after 50 uninterrupted years in the top division of English football.

Liverpool's first season in the Second Division in <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20Football%20League">1954–55</a> brought them an 11th-place finish. During this season the club suffered the biggest defeat in its history, a 9–1 loss to Birmingham City. Although in the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20Football%20League">following season</a> they improved to third place, it was not enough for Welsh to keep his job and he was sacked at the end of the season. His replacement was <a href="Phil%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201917%29">Phil Taylor</a>, a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff. Taylor signed players such as <a href="Ronnie%20Moran">Ronnie Moran</a>, <a href="Alan%20A%27Court">Alan A'Court</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Melia">Jimmy Melia</a>, who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come, but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division. The Liverpool board persisted with him, despite the club's loss to <a href="Non-League%20football">non-League</a> side <a href="Worcester%20City%20F.C.">Worcester City</a> in the third round of the FA Cup in January 1959. His tenure ended during the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Football%20League">1959–60 season</a>; after a good start, their form began to tail off mid-season, and after a defeat to <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, Taylor resigned. The man who replaced him was Huddersfield's manager, <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a>.

Madonna in the Church

Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) is a small <a href="Oil%20painting">oil</a> <a href="panel%20painting">panel</a> by the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>. Probably executed between c. 1438–40, it depicts the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a> holding the <a href="Child%20Jesus">Child Jesus</a> in a <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> cathedral. Mary is presented as <a href="Queen%20of%20Heaven">Queen of Heaven</a> wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips the neckline of her red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> tradition of the <a href="Eleusa%20icon">Eleusa icon</a> ("Virgin of Tenderness"). <a href="Tracery">Tracery</a> in the arch at the rear of the <a href="nave">nave</a> contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from <a href="Life%20of%20the%20Virgin">Mary's life</a>, while a <a href="faux%20bois">faux bois</a> sculpture in a <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niche</a> shows her holding the child in a similar pose. <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonna</a>, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's <a href="Virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus">virginal purity</a> and God's ethereal presence.

Most art historians see the panel as the left wing of a dismantled <a href="diptych">diptych</a>; presumably its opposite wing was a <a href="Donor%20portrait">votive portrait</a>. Near-contemporary copies by the <a href="Master%20of%201499">Master of 1499</a> and <a href="Jan%20Mabuse">Jan Gossaert</a> pair it with two very different right-hand images: one is of a donor kneeling in an interior setting; the other is set outdoors, with the donor being presented by St Anthony. Both painters made significant alterations to van Eyck's composition, which may have brought the image more up to date with contemporary styles, but the copies have been described as "spiritually if not aesthetically disastrous to the original concept".

"Madonna in the Church" was first documented in 1851. Since then its dating and attribution have been widely debated amongst scholars. At first thought an early work by Jan van Eyck, and for a period attributed to his brother <a href="Hubert%20van%20Eyck">Hubert van Eyck</a>, it is now definitively attributed to Jan and believed to be a later work, demonstrating techniques present in work from the mid-1430s and later. The panel was acquired for the Berlin <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%2C%20Berlin">Gemäldegalerie</a> in 1874. It was stolen in 1877 and soon returned, but without its original inscribed frame, which was never recovered. Today "Madonna in the Church" is widely considered one of van Eyck's finest; <a href="Millard%20Meiss">Millard Meiss</a> wrote that its "splendor and subtlety of [its depiction] of light is unsurpassed in Western art."

The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish art</a>. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the <a href="Turin-Milan%20Hours">Turin-Milan Hours</a> manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother <a href="Hubert%20van%20Eyck">Hubert van Eyck</a> in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.

Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Baldass">Ludwig von Baldass</a> placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from <a href="Meyer%20Schapiro">Meyer Schapiro</a>, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his "Early Netherlandish Painting". A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 "<a href="Saint%20Barbara%20%28van%20Eyck%29">Saint Barbara</a>" concluded that "Madonna in the Church" was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, <a href="Otto%20P%C3%A4cht">Otto Pächt</a> judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 "<a href="Arnolfini%20Portrait">Arnolfini Portrait</a>". In the early 21st century, <a href="Jeffrey%20Chipps%20Smith">Jeffrey Chipps Smith</a> and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.

At 31 cm × 14 cm, the painting's dimensions are small enough to be almost considered <a href="miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniature</a>, consistent with most 15th-century devotional diptychs. A reduced size increased portability and affordability, and encouraged the viewer to approach the piece to more closely see its intricate details. The work shows Mary wearing a dark blue robe – the colour traditionally used to emphasise her humanity – over a red dress of different textured fabrics. Her hem is embroidered in gold with gilded lettering that reads and , or perhaps in all probability, fragments of the Latin words for "sun" ("sole") and "light" ("lux"). On her head is an elaborately tiered and jeweled crown and in her arms she carries the infant Jesus, his feet resting on her left hand. Swaddled in a white cloth from hips trailing down beyond his feet, his hand clutches the jeweled neckline of his mother's dress.
Further depictions of Mary are found in the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child positioned between two lit candles in the <a href="choir%20screen">choir screen</a> behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a> singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an <a href="annunciation">annunciation</a> relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucifixion</a> is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column <a href="prayer%20tablet">prayer tablet</a> – similar to the one depicted in <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>'s large "<a href="Seven%20Sacraments%20Altarpiece">Seven Sacraments Altarpiece</a>" (1445–50) – hangs on a <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">pier</a> to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> overlook <a href="flying%20buttress">flying buttress</a>es, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vault</a>. Several different building phases can be seen in the <a href="triforium">arched gallery</a>, while the choral balcony and <a href="transept">transept</a> are depicted in a more contemporary style than the <a href="nave">nave</a>.

Closely detailed beams of light spill through the high windows and illuminate the interior, filling the portal and flowing across the tiled floors before it hits the clerestory windows. The brilliance of the daylight is juxtaposed with the gentle glow of the candles in the choir screen altar, while the lower portion of the pictorial space is relatively poorly lit. Shadows cast by the cathedral can be seen across the choir steps and near aisle. Their angle is rendered in an unusually realistic manner for early 15th century, and the detail is such that their description is likely based on observation of the actual behaviour of light, a further innovation in 15th-century art. Yet while the light is portrayed as it might appear in nature, its source is not. Panofsky notes that the sunlight enters from the north windows, but contemporary churches normally had east-facing choirs, so the light should enter from the south. He suggests the light is not intended to be natural, but rather to represent the divine, and hence subject to "the laws of symbolism and not those of nature."

According to <a href="Elisabeth%20Dhanens">Elisabeth Dhanens</a>, the shape and rounded top of the original frame is reminiscent of those found on the top register of panels of the <a href="Ghent%20altarpiece">Ghent altarpiece</a>, which are accepted as designed by Jan's brother Hubert. She believes the current frame is too narrow and small, and contains "clumsy marbling". From a detailed 1851 inventory, we know the text of the hymn inscribed on original frame. The text is written in a poetic form and begun on the lower border and then extended upwards on the vertical borders, ending on the top border. The lower border of the frame read ; the sides and top ("The mother is the daughter. This father is born. Who has heard of such a thing? God born a man"). The fifth stanza of the hymn (not included in van Eyck's transcription) reads, "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth but not staineth. Thus, the Virgin, as she was. Virgin still remaineth." The lettering on the hem of her robe echoes the inscription on the frame, words similar to those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 "<a href="Virgin%20and%20Child%20with%20Canon%20van%20der%20Paele">Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele</a>", a passage from the <a href="Book%20of%20Wisdom">Book of Wisdom</a> (7:29) reading ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior").

Some historians have suggested that the inscriptions were intended to breathe life into the other statues and depictions of Mary. Others, including <a href="Craig%20Harbison">Craig Harbison</a>, believe they were purely functional; given that contemporary diptychs were commissioned for private devotion and reflection, the inscriptions were meant to be read as an <a href="incantation">incantation</a> or were personalised <a href="indulgence">indulgence prayers</a>. Harbison notes that van Eyck's privately commissioned works are unusually heavily inscribed with prayer, and that the words may have served a similar function to prayer tablets, or more exactly "Prayer Wings", of the type seen in the reconstructed London "<a href="Virgin%20and%20Child%20%28after%20van%20der%20Goes%3F%29">Virgin and Child</a>" triptych.

Van Eyck's earlier work often shows churches and cathedrals in older <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> style, sometimes to represent the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a> as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. That is clearly not the case here – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large <a href="rood%20cross">rood cross</a> depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the "<a href="Church%20militant%20and%20church%20triumphant">Ecclesia Triumphans</a>" – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine art</a> and the <a href="International%20Gothic">International Gothic</a>. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.
The different elements of the cathedral are so specifically detailed and the elements of Gothic and contemporary architecture so well delineated, that art and architecture historians have concluded that van Eyck must have had enough architectural knowledge to make nuanced distinctions. More so, given the finesse of the descriptions, many scholars have tried to link the painting with a particular building. Yet, and as with all buildings in van Eyck's work, the structure is imagined and probably an idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect architectural space. This is evident from a number of features that would be unlikely in a contemporary church, such as the placing of a round arched triforium above a pointed <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a>.

Several art historians have reasoned why van Eyck did not model the interior on any actual building. Most agree that he sought to create an ideal and perfect space for Mary's apparition, and aimed for visual impact rather than physical possibility. Buildings suggested as possible (at least partial) sources include <a href="Saint%20Nicholas%27%20Church%2C%20Ghent">Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent</a>, the <a href="Basilica%20of%20St%20Denis">Basilica of St Denis</a>, <a href="Dijon%20Cathedral">Dijon Cathedral</a>, <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20Cathedral">Liège Cathedral</a> and <a href="Cologne%20Cathedral">Cologne Cathedral</a>, as well as the <a href="Tongeren%23Main%20sights">basilica of Our Lady</a> in Tongeren, which contains a very similar triforium gallery and clerestory. Tongeren is one of a minority of churches in the region aligned on a north-east to south-west axis, so that the lighting conditions in the painting can be seen on summer mornings. In addition, the church contains a standing statue of the Virgin and Child (the "Virgin with a tall crown"), once credited with miraculous powers, though the current statue post-dates van Eyck.

Pächt described the work in terms of an "interior illusion", noting the manner in which the viewer's eye falls across the nave, the crossing, but "only then, [is he] looking through and over the rood screen, the choir." From this Pächt views the perspective as deliberately lacking cohesion, as "the relationship between the parts of the building is not shown in full ... The transition from foreground to background is ingeniously masked by the figure of the Madonna herself, who obscures the crossing pier; the middle ground is practically eliminated and our eye crosses over it without our becoming aware of it." The illusion is enhanced by the use of colour to suggest light: the interior is dim and in shadow while the unseen exterior seems bathed in bright light.

Unusual for a 13th-century Gothic cathedral, most of the windows are of clear glass.
Looking at the windows running along the nave, John L. Ward observed that the window directly above the suspended crucifix is the only one whose uppermost portion is visible. That window directly faces the viewer, revealing intricately designed <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> panels that show intertwined red and blue flowers. Because the window is so far back in the pictorial space, where <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a> is becoming faint, the proximity of the flowers to the crucifix lends them the appearance of coming "forward in space, as if [they] had suddenly grown from the top of the crucifix in front of it."

Ward does not believe this a trick of the eye resulting from loss of perspective towards the high reaches of the panel. Instead he sees it as a subtle reference to the iconography and mythology of the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>' <a href="Tree%20of%20life%20%28biblical%29">Tree of life</a>, which he describes here as "reborn in Christ's death". He does acknowledge the subtlety of the illusion, and the fact that neither of the two well known near copies include the motif. The idea of flowers shown as if sprouting from the top of the cross may have been borrowed from <a href="Masaccio">Masaccio</a>'s c. 1426 "<a href="Crucifixion%20%28Masaccio%29">Crucifixion</a>", where flowers are placed on the upper portion of the vertical beam of the cross. Ward concludes than van Eyck took the idea even further by showing the flowers emanating from another source, and sought to depict the actual moment where the tree of life is reborn and "the cross comes to life and sprouts flowers as one watches".

In the early 15th century, Mary held a central position in <a href="Christian%20iconography">Christian iconography</a> and was often portrayed as the one in whom the "Word was made flesh", a direct result of the work of the <a href="divine%20light">divine light</a>. During the medieval period, light acted as a visual symbol for both the <a href="immaculate%20conception">immaculate conception</a> and Christ's birth; it was believed that he was made manifest by God's light passing through Mary's body, just as light shines through a window pane.

The divine represented by light is a motif in keeping with the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.

Light became a popular means for 15th-century Northern painters to represent the mystery of the <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">Incarnation</a>, utilising the idea of light passing through glass without shattering it to convey the paradox of conception and "<a href="Virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus">virgo intacta</a>". This is reflected in a passage attributed to <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a> from his "Sermones de Diversis"; "Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting it when entering nor destroying it when emerging: thus the word of God, the splendor of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb."

Before the early Netherlandish period, divine light was not well described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he typically painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than the effect of the light as it fell across it. Van Eyck was one of the first to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.

The panel is, with the Antwerp "<a href="Madonna%20at%20the%20Fountain">Madonna at the Fountain</a>", broadly accepted as one of van Eyck's two late "Madonna and Child" paintings before his death in about 1441. Both show a standing Virgin dressed in blue. In both works, Mary's positioning and colourisation contrasts with his earlier surviving treatments of the subject, in which she was typically seated and dressed in red. Models for standing Virgins existed in the icons of Byzantine art, and both paintings also represent modified versions of the <a href="Eleusa%20icon">"eleusa" type</a>, sometimes called the "Virgin of Tenderness" in English, where the Virgin and Child touch cheeks, and the child caresses Mary's face.

During the 14th and 15th centuries, a large number of these works were imported into northern Europe, and were widely copied by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, among others. The iconography of both the late Byzantine – typified by the unknown artist responsible for the "<a href="Cambrai%20Madonna">Cambrai Madonna</a>" – and 14th-century successors such as Giotto favoured presenting the Madonna on a monumental scale. Undoubtedly van Eyck absorbed these influences, though when and through which works is disputed. It is believed that he had first-hand exposure to them during his visit to Italy, which occurred either in 1426 or 1428, before the Cambrai icon was brought to the North. Van Eyck's two Madonna panels carried forward the habit of reproduction and were themselves frequently copied by commercial workshops throughout the 15th century.

It is possible that the Byzantine flavour to these images was also connected with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox Church</a>, in which van Eyck's patron <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a> took a keen interest. Van Eyck's "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Cardinal%20Niccol%C3%B2%20Albergati">Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati</a>" (c. 1431) depicts one of the papal diplomats most involved with these efforts.

Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the "<a href="Church%20militant%20and%20church%20triumphant">Ecclesia Triumphans</a>" and <a href="Queen%20of%20Heaven">Queen of Heaven</a>, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a "throne room", which envelopes her as if a "carrying case". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-<a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> type – perhaps best known through <a href="Giotto">Giotto</a>'s "<a href="Ognissanti%20Madonna">Ognissanti Madonna</a>" (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. <a href="Till-Holger%20Borchert">Till-Holger Borchert</a> says that van Eyck did not paint her as "the Madonna in a church", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary "as the Church". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.

The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Chancellor%20Rolin">Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</a>" and "Arnolfini Portrait". These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his "<a href="Annunciation%20%28van%20Eyck%2C%20Washington%29">Annunciation</a>" of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a "relatively immature painter", a copy of the "Annunciation" by <a href="Joos%20van%20Cleve">Joos van Cleve</a> shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.

Mary is presented as a <a href="Marian%20apparition">Marian apparition</a>; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's "Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele" (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.

As a prayer tablet placed on a pier was a distinctive trait of pilgrimage churches, Harbison sees the panel as partly concerned with the phenomenon of <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>. This type of tablet contained specific prayers whose recitation in front of a particular image or in the church was believed to attract an indulgence, or remission of time in <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a>. The statue of the Virgin and Child in the niche behind Mary's left shoulder might represent such an image, whereas the inscription of a Nativity hymn around the lost frame, ending in , i.e. "etcetera", would have told the viewer to recite the whole hymn, perhaps for an indulgence. The purpose of the picture, therefore, may have been to represent and bring the act of pilgrimage to a domestic setting. This would have been attractive to Philip the Good who, though he made many pilgrimages in person, is recorded as paying van Eyck to perform one on his behalf in 1426, apparently an acceptable practice in Late Medieval celestial accounting.

The Virgin and Child at the forefront might represent the background statues coming to life; at the time such an apparition was considered the highest form of pilgrimage experience. Their poses are similar and her tall crown is typical of those seen on statues rather than either royalty or painted figures of the Virgin. Harbison further suggests that the two pools of light on the floor echo the two candles on either side of one of the statues, and notes that the copies described below retain the prayer tablet, one bringing it nearer to the foreground.

Most art historians believe that there are a number of indicators that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled <a href="diptych">diptych</a>. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.

Harbison believes the panel is "almost certainly only the left-hand half of a devotional diptych". Dhanens observes how Mary's eyeline extends beyond the horizon of her panel, a common feature of Netherlandish diptychs and triptychs, where the saint's gaze is directed towards an accompanying image of a donor. Other indicators include the unusually oblique architectural aspect of the church, which suggests that its depiction was intended to extend across to a sister wing – in a manner similar to the <a href="Master%20of%20Flemalle">Master of Flemalle</a>'s "Annunciation", and especially in van der Weyden's c. 1452 "<a href="Braque%20Triptych">Braque Triptych</a>", where continuity between the panels is especially emphasised.

Two near-contemporary copies, usually attributed to the Ghent <a href="Master%20of%201499">Master of 1499</a> and <a href="Jan%20Mabuse">Jan Gossaert</a>, were completed while the original was in the collection of <a href="Margaret%20of%20Austria%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Savoy">Margaret of Austria</a>, great-granddaughter of Philip the Good. Both present variants of the Madonna panel as the left wing of a devotional diptych, with a <a href="donor%20portrait">donor portrait</a> as the right wing. However, the two donor panels have very different settings. The 1499 version shows the <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> abbot Christiaan de Hondt praying in his luxurious quarters, while Gossaert presents the donor Antonio Siciliano, accompanied by <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">Saint Anthony</a>, in a panoramic landscape setting. It is not known if either work is based on an original left-hand panel painted by van Eyck.

The 1499 Madonna panel is a free adaption, in that the artist has changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the detriment of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's "Arnolfini Portrait", including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.

Around 1520–30, the <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> <a href="Illuminated%20manuscript">illuminator</a> and miniaturist <a href="Simon%20Bening">Simon Bening</a> produced a half-length "" that closely resembles van Eyck's panel, to the extent that it can be considered a loose copy. However, it can be more closely related to the original "<a href="Cambrai%20Madonna">Cambrai Madonna</a>" especially in its retention of the halo, which was considered old fashioned by the 15th century. Bening's Madonna is distinct to the two earlier copies of van Eyck; it was intended as a stand-alone panel, not part of a diptych, and though compositionally similar, radically departs from the original, especially in its colourisation. It is thought that Bening's work was informed by Gossaert's panel rather than directly by van Eyck's.

The <a href="provenance">provenance</a> of the work contains many gaps, and even the better-documented periods are often complicated or "murky", according to Dhanens. There is almost no record from the early 16th century through 1851, and the theft in 1877 leaves doubt for some as to what exactly was returned. Historian <a href="L%C3%A9on%20de%20Laborde">Léon de Laborde</a> documented an altarpiece in a village near <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a> in 1851 – a Madonna in a church nave holding the Christ Child in her right arm – which he described as "painted on wood, very well preserved, still in its original frame". The description contains a detailing of the frame's inscription. A document from 1855 records a "Virgin in the Church" thought to be by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, which may be the same painting. It belonged to a Monsieur Nau, who had bought it for 50 <a href="French%20franc">franc</a>s from the housekeeper of Francois Cacault, a French diplomat who had acquired a number of paintings from Italy.

A panel very similar in description was purchased by the <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a> art collector <a href="Barthold%20Suermondt">Barthold Suermondt</a> sometime during the 1860s and catalogued in 1869 with a detailing of the frame's inscription. This work was thought to have come from Nantes, suggesting it was the same as the panel mentioned in 1851. The Suermondt collection was acquired by the Berlin museum in May 1874, as part of an acquisition of 219 paintings. The painting was stolen in March 1877, generating worldwide news coverage; it was recovered ten days later, but without the original frame. The 1875 Berlin museum catalogue attributes a van Eyck imitator; the 1883 catalogue describes the original as lost and the Berlin painting a copy. Soon after, however, its authenticity was verified, and the 1904 Berlin catalogue attributed Jan.

Philip the Good may have been the original patron, given that a painting matching its description was recorded in a 1567 inventory of his great-granddaughter Margaret of Austria, who inherited the majority of Philip's collection. The description in her record reads, ""Un autre tableau de Nostre-Dame, du duc Philippe, qui est venu de Maillardet, couvert de satin brouché gris, et ayant fermaulx d'argent doré et bordé de velours vert. Fait de la main Johannes."" From the naming conventions known from the collection's inventory, "Johannes" probably refers to van Eyck, "duc Philippe" to Philip.

Washington v. Texas

Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967), is a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> case in which the Court <a href="Holding%20%28law%29">decided</a> that the <a href="Compulsory%20Process%20Clause">Compulsory Process Clause</a> of the <a href="Sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Sixth Amendment to the Constitution</a> (guaranteeing the right of a criminal <a href="defendant">defendant</a> to force the attendance of <a href="witness">witness</a>es for their side) is applicable in <a href="State%20court%20%28United%20States%29">state courts</a> as well as <a href="Federal%20judiciary%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal courts</a>. Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co-defendant as a witness, but was blocked by <a href="Judiciary%20of%20Texas">Texas courts</a> because <a href="Law%20of%20Texas">state law</a> prevented co-defendants from testifying for each other, under the theory that they would be likely to <a href="perjury">lie for each other</a> on the stand.

The Supreme Court reasoned that the <a href="Due%20Process%20Clause">Due Process Clause</a> of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> made the right to be able to compel defense witnesses to testify necessary for a defendant's "due process" rights to fair proceedings, which applies to the states. Only Justice <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan%20II">John Marshall Harlan II</a> parted from the Court's "due process" focus, <a href="Concurring%20opinion">though he agreed</a> with the outcome, as he regularly did in cases involving <a href="incorporation%20of%20the%20Bill%20of%20Rights">whether to apply federal rights to state courts</a>.

The impact of "Washington" was narrowed by a later case, "<a href="Taylor%20v.%20Illinois">Taylor v. Illinois</a>" (1988), in which the Court said that "countervailing public interests", like the need to move through cases quickly, could be balanced against a defendant's right to present witnesses. In "Taylor", the Supreme Court upheld a judge's order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to the defense attorney's deliberate failure to <a href="Discovery%20%28law%29">disclose evidence</a> to prosecutors earlier in the trial. The defense attorney's actions resulted in a lengthy delay in the proceedings which the trial judge felt was unjustified. Legal scholars have seen this new grant of discretion to trial judges as a change to relying on "efficient justice", a more limited vision of trial rights than the "right to present a defense" created in "Washington".

The Compulsory Process Clause was ratified as part of the <a href="Sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a> in 1791. It accords a criminal defendant "the right ... to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor." The Clause was included among other rights (e.g. right to a <a href="notice">notice</a> of charges) as a foundation for how federal criminal justice would operate. Originally, the Sixth Amendment was only applicable to the federal government.

Despite ratification of the Clause, compulsory process was not originally interpreted to permit co-defendants to testify for each other. States relied on a fear that two defendants would both "swear the other [out]" of the charge to prevent either defendant from being convicted. In "Benson v. United States" (1892), the Supreme Court explained the underlying <a href="common%20law">common law</a> theory for this prohibition; namely, that only witnesses who were "unaffected as a party by the result, and free from any of the temptations of interest" could testify. Federal courts accepted these common law rules and expressly applied them in "United States v. Reid" (1852). In "Reid", the Court held that the common law pertaining to criminal procedure in force at the time of the Constitution's ratification would be applied in federal courts; this effectively kept the bar on co-defendant testimony. While "Reid" was overruled on different grounds in 1918, it stated the general practice for co-defendants as witnesses that existed before the Fourteenth Amendment.

After the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, the Supreme Court dealt with a series of cases regarding the scope of that amendment's Due Process Clause. This Clause says that "Nor shall any State deprive any person of <a href="Life%2C%20Liberty%20and%20the%20pursuit%20of%20Happiness%23Lockean%20roots%20hypothesis">life, liberty, or property</a> without due process of law". The Court initially rejected an argument that the Due Process Clause applied to the state governments in "Hurtado v. California" (1884), a case concerning the right to a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> hearing. Justice <a href="Stanley%20Matthews%20%28lawyer%29">Matthews</a>, writing for the majority of the Court, reasoned that "the Amendment prescribing due process of law is too vague and indefinite to operate as a practical restraint." While this decision rejected an expanded reach of the Due Process Clause, the Court stated that the Clause did protect against state encroachment on "fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions".

"Hurtado" left open the question of what "fundamental principles of liberty and justice" would be protected. In 1897, the Court held in "<a href="Chicago%2C%20B.%20%26amp%3B%20Q.%20R.%20Co.%20v.%20Chicago">Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad v. Chicago</a>" (1897) that the Fifth Amendment's Just Compensation Clause relating to <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a> takings was "an essential element of due process of law ordained by the Fourteenth Amendment" to the point that a Chicago taking of railroad property was "within the meaning of that amendment". In finding that application of the Due Process Clause, the Court said that just compensation constituted "a vital principle of republican institutions [without which] almost all other rights would become worthless".

In the same year as the railroad takings case, the Court evaluated what procedural trial rights implicated the "fundamental principles of liberty" expressed in "Hurtado". In "Hovey v. Elliot", the Supreme Court specifically applied the Due Process Clause to some fair trial guarantees, holding that due process "secures an 'inherent right of defense'". Despite that broad statement, the Court emphasized that due to procedural issues with the case itself "our opinion is therefore exclusively confined to the case before us."

A decade after "Hovey", the Supreme Court announced its first rule for how the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would be applied. In "Twining v. New Jersey" (1908), the Court held that "it is possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight amendments against National action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law". This understanding of the meaning of "due process" opened up the possibility that the Bill of Rights could be applied to the states. Specifically, the Court said in "Twining" that the test was whether the right was embedded in "the very idea of free government". This test endorsed a "selective incorporation" approach, meaning one that would evaluate whether to apply a right to the states on a case-by-case basis.

The selective incorporation principle was expanded on further in "<a href="Palko%20v.%20Connecticut">Palko v. Connecticut</a>" (1937), where the Court examined whether the right against <a href="double%20jeopardy">double jeopardy</a> should be incorporated against the states. In "Palko", the Court stated that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights could be applied to the states if the right was "found to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty". Though eight justices agreed that the double jeopardy right was "not" "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty", the "Palko" test has remained the standard for incorporating rights against state and local governments.

After "Palko", the Court examined Bill of Rights protections one by one. Despite this incremental approach, the Court would eventually apply most rights to the states.

In the realm of criminal procedure, this doctrine eventually came to protect the defendant's ability to "present exculpatory evidence and testimony of witnesses". For example, the Court in "<a href="Brady%20v.%20Maryland">Brady v. Maryland</a>" (1963) used the Due Process Clause to require the state prosecution authorities to disclose <a href="Evidence%20%28law%29">evidence</a> that is favorable to a defendant prior to trial.

The Court's due process jurisprudence was expanded with the 1948 decision in "In re Oliver", which revised the breadth of the "fundamental fairness" right. The Court wrote:

Jackie Washington was charged with <a href="Murder%23Degrees%20of%20murder%20in%20the%20United%20States">first-degree murder</a> in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>. At the trial, Washington testified on his own behalf, and he put a great deal of the blame on an accomplice named Charles Fuller. He testified that Fuller had been carrying the murder weapon—a shotgun—at the scene. When he sought to have Fuller testify to back up his story, the trial judge blocked him on the basis of a Texas statute which provided that "persons charged or convicted as co-participants in the same crime could not testify for one another". The law, however, did not block a co-participant from testifying for the state.

Washington was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison. His conviction was subsequently upheld by the <a href="Texas%20Court%20of%20Criminal%20Appeals">Texas Court of Criminal Appeals</a>, Texas's highest criminal court, in 1966. The Court of Criminal Appeals, which reasoned that the Compulsory Process Clause did not affect how the state treated the "competency" of a witness, rejected Washington's plea that Fuller should have been allowed to testify. Washington then <a href="writ%20of%20certiorari">petitioned</a> the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case, and the Supreme Court granted <a href="Judicial%20review%20in%20the%20United%20States">review</a>.

Chief Justice <a href="Earl%20Warren">Earl Warren</a> wrote the <a href="majority%20opinion">opinion</a> of the Court, which spoke for eight justices in reversing the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Warren began by stating that the Court had never been "previously called upon to decide whether the right of the accused to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor ... is so fundamental [that] it is incorporated in the Due Process Clause". Because of the incorporation to states of other procedural guarantees, the "right to offer the testimony of witnesses" could be given no less weight. Warren wrote that it was critical to the ability to "present a defense ... [a] defendant's version of the facts". This broad right was necessary to detail thoroughly, he wrote, because ignoring how the right would actually be applied would risk making the right to compel witnesses futile.

After determining that the Sixth Amendment's "right to compulsory process is applicable in this state proceeding" (i.e. that the Compulsory Process Clause applied to the states), the question became whether the specific instance of Washington's trial was an unconstitutional deprivation of that right. Despite the common law restriction against co-defendants testifying for each other, Warren noted that federal courts had refused to be "bound by 'the dead hand of the common-law'" since 1918. Along with the precedent of prior federal court decisions, the fact that there were a great deal of exceptions to this rule demonstrated the "absurdity of the rule" itself. Specifically, under the Texas statute—which allowed a defendant acquitted at a separate trial to testify for the other defendant at the other's trial—the "law leaves [the co-defendant] free to testify when he has a great incentive to <a href="perjury">perjury</a>, [but] bars his testimony in situations where he has a lesser motive to lie".

Warren concluded that the nature of the Texas law at issue denied Washington the right for a fair trial using witnesses who could testify to "relevant and material" facts in the case. Here, while not entirely relying on the finding, the Court saw the law as "arbitrary" because its discrimination between the prosecution and defense served "no rational relationship" to any goal of preventing perjury. Further, the idea that a "competent" witness was barred from testifying, in and of itself, was held to be an unconstitutional predetermination on the part of the state legislature. The Court's decision upheld the importance of juries in evaluating the truth and credibility of witnesses' statements.

Despite adopting a broad principle, the Court did not list any specific rules for how trial judges were to balance evidentiary standards and the right of the defendant to secure witnesses in his or her favor.

Justice Harlan, who agreed with the decision to reverse the Texas court's judgment but not with the majority's reasoning, wrote a short separate <a href="concurring%20opinion">concurring opinion</a>. He repeated his position that the Due Process Clause did not incorporate the Bill of Rights to the states; rather, the Bill of Rights was a "rational continuum, which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints". He isolated the Texas law's distinction between the co-defendant testifying for the state while being barred from testifying for the defendant as having "no justification". Thus, he rejected holding the trial unconstitutional on Compulsory Process Clause grounds; he argued instead that the State's "arbitrary bar" against a criminal defendant's calling a co-defendant as a witness for his side, while allowing the co-defendant to testify for the prosecution, violated the Due Process Clause.

In two cases after "Washington", the Court pulled back from its broad principle that a defendant in a criminal proceeding has a "right to a defense". In "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Valenzuela-Bernal">United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal</a>" (1982), the Court held that an argument by the government that it had an interest in deporting illegal aliens (some witnesses in the case) outweighed the defendant's right to "eye witness testimony". Additionally, in "Taylor v. Illinois" (1988), the Court held that "countervailing public interests" could also outweigh the defendant's compulsory process rights.

In "Taylor", a series of deliberate <a href="Discovery%20%28law%29">discovery</a> violations by the defense counsel at trial led the trial judge to block attempts at postponing proceedings to allow a further undisclosed defense witness the chance to testify; the judge had held that there must be some sanction against the defense for their failure to disclose witnesses earlier in the case. A divided Court upheld the trial judge's preclusion of the witness, adding a new framework for balancing a defendant's right to a robust defense with a series of other factors. Namely, the new framework required looking at the state's interest in "efficient" justice, the state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, the state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.

Analysis of "Washington" has focused on the decision in the broader context of procedural trial rights. A 2007 article in the "<a href="Georgetown%20Law%23Publications">Georgetown Law Review</a>" by Martin Hewett was critical of the decision. Hewett's main criticism was based on the Court's lack of a standard on which to evaluate whether certain evidence was "material" to a defendant's case. Hewett noted that in a post-"Washington" decision in 1973, the Court applied a "case-specific" decision rather than a "general constitutional standard". This line of decisions, Hewett argued, led to a standard which allows a trial judge the authority to determine the "actual reliability of the evidence" in cases where a <a href="hearsay">witness is not present</a>. The "newly-seized power" was limited to the cases at hand in a manner which suggested the ambiguous calculus the Court was using was flawed. This vagueness in the standard came from cases where the "situations [involved] the reliability of the excluded evidence [that] could factfinder". Hewett concluded by arguing that all of these cases had diminished the protections of the jury and of the defendant's right to have his own defense.

An article in the "<a href="American%20Criminal%20Law%20Review">American Criminal Law Review</a>", published in 2011 by Stacey Kime, disagreed with some of Hewett's arguments. Kime argued that "it is well settled that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence", disagreeing with the idea that the basis for a robust defense had been gutted. Instead, she blamed the "incoherent" standard today on a lack of understanding of where the "source of this constitutional right" to have a strong defense lies. Unlike Hewett, who targeted post-"Washington" decisions, Kime believed that there were flaws in the "Washington" opinion itself. Specifically, she argued that "the Court's reasoning was not only unnecessary, but the "Washington" doctrine itself is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment's history and text".

In her review of the history behind the Sixth Amendment, Kime argued that <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> could have drafted a more comprehensive right to "call for evidence" (as existed in the <a href="Virginia%20Declaration%20of%20Rights">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a>) but failed to do so. With this context in mind, she said, the Compulsory Process Clause likely enshrined the right to <a href="subpoena">subpoena</a> witnesses and have a fair trial, rather than a broader "right to have a defense". Kime's analysis concluded by stating that the decision in "Washington" had put "unnecessary tension between two analytically distinct constitutional rights".

Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych

The Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych (or Diptych with Calvary and Last Judgement) consists of two small painted panels attributed to the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> artist <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>, with areas finished by unidentified followers or members of his workshop. This <a href="diptych">diptych</a> is one of the early <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a> <a href="Panel%20painting">oil on panel</a> masterpieces, renowned for its unusually complex and highly detailed <a href="iconography">iconography</a>, and for the technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a miniature format; the panels are just high by wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for private devotion.

The left-hand wing depicts the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion.</a> It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling about in the mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure sky with a view of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the <a href="Last%20Judgment">Last Judgement</a>: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of <a href="Christ%20in%20Majesty">Christ in Majesty</a> flanked by a <a href="Deesis">Great Deësis</a> of saints, <a href="apostles">apostles</a>, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original <a href="Gilding">gilt</a> frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the <a href="Books%20of%20the%20Bible">books</a> of <a href="Book%20of%20Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> and <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Revelation</a>. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were <a href="Transfer%20of%20panel%20paintings">transferred to canvas</a> supports in 1867.

The earliest surviving mention of the work appears in 1841, when scholars believed the two panels were wings of a lost <a href="triptych">triptych</a>. The <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> acquired the diptych in 1933. At that time, the work was attributed to Jan's brother <a href="Hubert%20van%20Eyck">Hubert</a> because key areas formally resembled pages of the "<a href="Turin-Milan%20Hours">Turin-Milan Hours</a>", which were then believed to be of Hubert's hand. On the evidence of technique and the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe the panels are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck painted the panels around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.

Along with <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a> and later <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, Van Eyck revolutionised the approach towards naturalism and <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a> in Northern European painting during the early to mid 15th century. He was the first to manipulate oils to give the close detailing that infused his figures with the high degree of realism and complexity of emotion seen in this diptych. He coupled this with a mastery of glaze to create luminous surfaces with a deep perspective—most noticeable in the upper portion of the "Crucifixion" panel—which had not been achieved before.

In the 1420s and 1430s, when oil and panel painting were still in their infancy, vertical formats were often used for <a href="Doom%20paintings">depictions of the Last Judgement</a>, because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the <a href="Crucifixion%20in%20the%20arts">Crucifixion</a> were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the "Crucifixion" panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative. The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top in the style of medieval <a href="Tapestry">tapestries</a>. Art historian <a href="Otto%20P%C3%A4cht">Otto Pächt</a> says it "is the whole world in one painting, an <a href="Orbis%20Pictus">Orbis Pictus</a>".

In the "Crucifixion" panel, van Eyck follows the early 14th-century tradition of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative technique. According to art historian <a href="Jeffrey%20Chipps%20Smith">Jeffrey Chipps Smith</a>, the episodes appear as "simultaneous, not sequential" events. Van Eyck condenses key episodes from the gospels into a single composition, each placed so as to draw the viewer's eye upward in a logical sequence. This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">illusion of depth</a> with more complex and unusual spatial arrangements. In the "Crucifixion" panel, he uses different indicators to show the relative closeness of particular groupings of figures to Jesus. Given the size of the mourners in the foreground relative to the crucified figures, the soldiers and spectators gathered in the mid-ground are far larger than a strict adherence to perspective would allow. In the "Last Judgement" the damned are placed in hell in the lower mid-ground while the saints and angels are positioned higher in the upper foreground. Pächt writes of this panel that the scene is "assimilated into a single spatial cosmos", with the archangel acting as a divider in the pictorial space between heaven and hell.

Art historians are unsure as to whether the panels were meant to be a diptych or a triptych. They may have formed the outer wings of a triptych, with a since-lost panel representing the <a href="Adoration%20of%20the%20Magi">Adoration of the Magi</a> at the centre, or, as the German art historian <a href="Johann%20David%20Passavant">J.D. Passavant</a> speculated in 1841, the lost centre panel may have been a <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus%20in%20art">Nativity</a>. It is now thought unlikely that a lost panel could be the postulated original companion to the outer wings; such a coupling would have been very odd to painters of the 1420s and 1430s. It has also been proposed that a central piece was added later, or as Albert Châtelet writes, the central panel may have been stolen. Art historian <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> believed the "Crucifixion" and "Last Judgement" panels were intended as a diptych. He argued that it would have been unusual for mere outer wings to have been given the "sumptuous treatment" afforded these two panels. This approach is reminiscent of the medieval <a href="reliquary">reliquaries</a>. Others have observed that triptychs were usually much larger works intended for public display, and they tended towards gilded and heavily inscribed frames; typically only the central panel would have been as lavishly decorated as these panels. Contemporary diptychs, in contrast, were usually produced for private devotion and were typically ungilded. There is no documentary evidence for an original central panel, however, and technical examination suggests the two works were intended as wings of a diptych, then an emerging format. Pächt believes there is not enough evidence to determine whether a third panel existed.

The "Crucifixion" panel comprises three horizontal planes, each representing different moments from the <a href="Passion%20%28Christianity%29">Passion</a>. The upper third shows the <a href="crucifixion">crucifixion</a> before a view of <a href="Jerusalem%20in%20Christianity">Jerusalem</a>; the lower two thirds detail the crowds and Jesus' followers at <a href="Calvary">Golgotha</a> ("Place of the Skull"). Located outside the city walls amongst rock tombs and gardens, in the first century Golgotha was Jerusalem's place of execution, and the visible patches of hill highlight the area's "stony, forbidding, and lifeless" nature. The atmosphere of bleakness is reinforced by the random figures in the upper ground that scramble for a better view. The gospels tell of Jesus' followers and relatives, as well as his prosecutors and assorted spectators, attending the crucifixion at Golgotha. In van Eyck's panel the former are represented in the foreground, while the latter, including <a href="High%20Priest%20%28Judaism%29">High Priests</a> and <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple Elders</a>, are shown in the mid-ground.
The centre foreground shows a group of five mourners, with three other figures set to the right and left. In the center group, <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a> supports the Virgin <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary</a>, surrounded by three women. Mary's <a href="Swoon%20of%20the%20Virgin">dramatic swoon</a> in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her "closest to the viewer's presumed position". Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner. She is the only figure from this group shown to look directly at Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses. The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying <a href="sibyls">sibyls</a>, and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross with her back to the viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the <a href="Erythraean%20Sibyl">Erythraean</a> or the <a href="Cumaean%20Sibyl">Cumaean</a> sibyl, both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection. She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised, and as compassionate contemplation of the other women's grief.

The mid-ground shows a crowd scene above the group of mourners, separated by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings. The mourners from the foreground are reflected in the shield carried on the hip of the lance-bearing Roman soldier who leans on the man to his right wearing a red turban. Smith believes this serves to highlight the mourners' emotional and physical separation from the assorted figures gathered in the mid-ground. Art historian Adam Labuda sees these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the panel's dramatic sequence.
Van Eyck's depiction lays particular emphasis on the brutishness and indifference of the crowd witnessing Christ's suffering. They comprise a mixture of Roman legionaries, judges and various hangers-on arriving to witness the spectacle. A number are dressed in rich, brightly coloured clothes, a mixture of oriental and northern European styles, while several are mounted on horseback. Some openly jeer and taunt the condemned, others gape stupefied at "just another" execution, while others talk amongst themselves. The exception is the armoured <a href="centurion">centurion</a>, seated on a white horse at the extreme right edge of the panel, who looks up at Christ, arms spread wide, head thrown back, at "the very moment of his illumination" in recognition of Christ's divinity. The horsemen closely resemble both the "" and "" from the lower inner panels of van Eyck's c. 1432 "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>". Art historian <a href="Till-Holger%20Borchert">Till-Holger Borchert</a> observes that these figures are given "greater dynamism by being seen in rear rather than profile view", and that this vantage point draws the observer's eye upwards towards the mid-ground and the crucifixion.

Van Eyck extends the height of the crosses to an unrealistic degree to allow the crucifixion to dominate the upper third of the panel. Christ faces the viewer directly, while the crosses of the two thieves are set at angles to either side. The thieves are each bound with cords of rope rather than nails. The body of the thief to the right—the <a href="Penitent%20thief">repentant thief</a> mentioned in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>—is lifeless. The <a href="Impenitent%20thief">"bad" thief</a> to his left is dying twisted in pain, and according to art historian <a href="William%20Henry%20James%20Weale">James W.H. Weale</a>, depicted as "struggling desperately, but in vain". Both men's hands have turned black from a lack of blood flow. A placard prepared by Pilate or Roman soldiers placed above Jesus' head reads "<a href="Jesus%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Jews">Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews</a>" in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.
The panel captures the instant of Christ's death, traditionally the moment after the breaking of the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, at the base of the cross, <a href="Saint%20Longinus">Longinus</a>, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a <a href="Holy%20Lance">lance</a>, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured <a href="Stephaton">Stephaton</a> holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.

The first generation of <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painters did not usually pay much attention to landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements of the composition, seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains one of the most memorable landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with <a href="Cumulus%20cloud">cumulus</a> clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the "Ghent Altarpiece" and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint <a href="Cirrus%20cloud">cirrus</a> clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.

The right hand wing, as with the "Crucifixion" wing, is divided horizontally into three areas. Here they represent, from top to bottom heaven, earth and hell. Heaven contains a traditional <a href="Deesis">Great Deësis</a> with clergy and laity; earth, in the mid-ground, is dominated by the figures of <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Archangel Michael</a> and a <a href="Death%20%28personification%29">personification of Death</a>; while in the lower ground the damned fall into hell, where they are tortured and eaten by beasts. Describing the hell passage, art historian Bryson Burroughs writes that "the diabolical inventions of <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Bosch</a> and <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Brueghel</a> are children's boggy lands compared to the horrors of the hell [van Eyck] has imagined."
Pächt compares the scene to a medieval <a href="bestiary">bestiary</a>, comprising a "whole fauna of zoomorphic fiends". Van Eyck's hell is inhabited by demonic monsters whose only visible features are often "their glittering eyes and the white of their fangs". The sinners fall head first into their torment, at the mercy of devils taking recognisable forms such as rats, snakes and pigs, as well as a bear and a donkey. Daringly, van Eyck shows kings and members of the clergy among those condemned to hell.

The earth is represented by the narrow area between heaven and hell. The passage shows the resurrection of the dead as the fires of the last day rage. The dead rise from their graves to the left and from the stormy sea to the right. The Archangel Michael stands on death's shoulders, the largest figure in the painting, whose body and wings span the entire pictorial space. Michael wears jewel-studded golden armour and has curly blond hair and multicoloured wings similar to those seen in the <a href="donor%20portrait">donor panel</a> of van Eyck's 1437 Dresden "<a href="Dresden%20Triptych">Triptych of the Virgin and Child</a>". Michael appears, according to Smith, "like a giant on the earth, whose crust is revealed to be the wings of the skeletal figure of Death. The damned are excreted though Death's bowels into the dark slime of hell." The bat-like death figure, with skull extruding up to earth and skeletal arms and legs reaching down into hell, is the protagonist of the narrative according to Pächt, but death is vanquished by the slim and youthful looking <a href="archangel">archangel</a> standing between the horrors of hell and the promise of heaven.
The upper portion of the panel shows the second coming as recorded in <a href="The%20Sheep%20and%20the%20Goats">Matthew 25:31</a>: "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory." Christ, who was naked, frail and almost lifeless in the "Crucifixion" panel, is now resurrected and <a href="Christ%20in%20Majesty">triumphant in heaven</a>. He is dressed in a long red <a href="cope">mantle</a> and is barefoot. His hands and feet are surrounded by circles of yellow light. The <a href="Holy%20Wounds">Holy Wounds</a> are visible on his
palms held open; the puncture mark left by Longinus' spear is visible on his side through the opening in his robe, as are the nail holes on his feet.

Christ is seated at the centre of a large array of angels, saints and holy elders. According to Pächt, in this scene in heaven that "all is sweetness, gentleness and order." Mary and <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> kneel in prayer to his immediate right and left. Both have halos and are rendered at a far larger scale than the surrounding figures, over whom they seem to tower. Mary holds her right hand at her breast, while her left is raised as if to ask for mercy for the smaller naked figures sheltered by her cloak, evoking the conventional pose of the <a href="Virgin%20of%20Mercy">Virgin of Mercy</a>. A choir of virgins gather directly under Christ's feet. They face outwards towards the viewer and sing Christ's praise.

Headed by <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a>, the Apostles are dressed in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ and to the right and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups gathered at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and are dressed in white <a href="amice">amice</a> and <a href="alb">alb</a>s, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue <a href="dalmatic">dalmatic</a> vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear the <a href="Arma%20Christi">symbols of the crucifixion</a> already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and <a href="crown%20of%20thorns">crown of thorns</a>, the angel on the right a <a href="Holy%20Sponge">sponge</a> and <a href="Nail%20%28relic%29">nails</a>.

Van Eyck was a central influence on <a href="Petrus%20Christus">Petrus Christus</a> and the younger painter is thought to have studied the panels while they were still in van Eyck's workshop. He made a much larger and adapted paraphrase of the panel in 1452, as part of a monumental altarpiece, now in Berlin. Although there are significant differences between the two works, the influence of van Eyck on Christus' work is most evident in the vertical, narrow format and in the central figure of Saint Michael, who also divides the scene between heaven and hell.
Art historian John Ward highlights the rich and complex <a href="iconography">iconography</a> and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed to bring attention to what he saw as the co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. In his paintings, iconographical features are typically subtly woven into the work, as "relatively small, in the background, or in the shadow [details]". The significance of the imagery is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meanings become apparent. According to Ward, the iconographical elements are commonly positioned "initially to overlook, and eventually to discover". Writing about the "Last Judgement" panel, Burroughs notes that "each of its several scenes requires attention for itself alone." According to Ward, van Eyck forces the viewer to search for the meaning in the iconography, creating a multi-layered surface which rewards the attentive viewer with deeper understanding of both the painting and its symbols. Much of van Eyck's iconography intends to convey the idea of "the promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth".

Both the frames and pictorial areas of the diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning in a manner similar to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.

In this work, the inscriptions are in Roman capitals or Gothic miniature, and in some places seem to contain misspellings, making interpretation difficult. Its gold-lined frame and Latin inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the two panels, indicate that the donor was wealthy and educated. The sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the <a href="Book%20of%20Isaiah">Book of Isaiah</a> (:6–9, 12), <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Revelations</a> (:13, 21:3–4) or the <a href="Book%20of%20Deuteronomy">Book of Deuteronomy</a> (:23–24). In the right hand panel, the wings of the figure of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the left are the words ("great chaos"), with ("shadow of death") inscribed to the right. A warning from Matthew 25:41 is written on both sides of death's head and wings, and extends from earth down into the hell section. It reads, "Ite vos maledicti in ignem eternam" ("Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"). In this way, van Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual beams of light seemingly hurled from the heavens. Also in the section are letters reading 

In the mid-ground, the Archangel Michael's armour is heavily inscribed with esoteric and often difficult to source phrases. Letters on his breast plate read while his jewel-encrusted oval <a href="buckler">buckler</a> displays the cross and is decorated with Greek script reading . The meaning of this phrase has not been conclusively identified; some art historians believe it contains misspellings and has been misread. Friedländer transcribed the first word as while the final word is thought be taken from the first four letters of the Hebrew words for "Thou Art Mighty", and thus may signify God; the word also appears in a floor tile in the "Ghent Altarpiece". In the upper portion, gilded inscriptions running vertically across the edges of Christ's mantle read ("Come, ye blessed of my father").

Over the years the panels have been attributed to both Jan and <a href="Hubert%20van%20Eyck">Hubert van Eyck</a> as well as Petrus Christus. In 1841, Passavant attributed the diptych jointly to Hubert and Jan van Eyck; by 1853, he had revised his opinion and gave attribution exclusively to Jan. <a href="Gustav%20Friedrich%20Waagen">Gustav Waagen</a>, the first director of the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%2C%20Berlin">Gemäldegalerie, Berlin</a>, attributed them to Petrus Christus in the mid 19th-century, based on the left hand panel's similarity in composition to a 1452 "Last Judgement" signed by Christus now in Berlin. This view was rejected in 1887, and they once more became associated with Jan. The panels came into the possession of the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Gallery</a> in 1917, credited to Jan.
Bryson Burroughs, writing for the Metropolitan at the time of their acquisition in 1933, attributed the works to Hubert. Burroughs saw in the panels the hand of an expressive artist, "all nerves and sensibilities", overcome with sympathy for the plight of the central figures in the panels, but who was nonetheless weak in drawing line. This profile, he believed, was incompatible with the aloof and impassive master craftsman Jan is known to have been. Yet Burroughs acknowledged there was "no certain documented proof for the attribution [to Hubert]." He admitted his evidence was "limited, inevitably incomplete", and thus "circumstantial and presumptive". More recent scholarship tends to agree Jan painted the panels based on the evidence that they are stylistically closer to Jan than Hubert, who died in 1426; and that Jan, who travelled across the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> to Italy that year, painted the mountain range.

The paintings have often been compared to the seven pages of the "<a href="Turin-Milan%20Hours">Turin-Milan Hours</a>" <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a> attributed to the unidentified artist "Hand G", generally thought to have been Jan van Eyck. The closeness is seen to lie both in the miniaturist technique and the particular painterly style. The similarity of a Turin drawing of the crucified Christ to the figure in the New York diptych has led some art historians to conclude they were, at least, painted near the same time, during the 1420s and early 1430s. Most believe both the drawing and diptych panel at least originated from a prototype designed by Jan van Eyck. Panofsky attributed the New York panels to "Hand G". When the "Turin-Milan Hours" miniatures were discovered they were at first believed to have been painted before the <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">Duke of Berry</a>'s death in 1416, an idea that was quickly rejected with the date extended to sometime in the early 1430s.

Pächt writes of the diptych that it reflects the "personal style and unique scenic imagination" of "Hand G" (whom he believed to be either Hubert or Jan). Until <a href="Hans%20Belting">Hans Belting</a> and Dagmar Eichberger's 1983 "Jan van Eyck als Erzähler", academics tended to focus exclusively on the diptych's dating and attribution, with little attention paid to its source influences and iconography. Borchert estimates a completion of c. 1440, while Paul Durrieu suggests a dating as early as 1413. In 1983, Belting and Eichberger suggested a date of c. 1430 based on specific characteristics of the work: the "birds-eye view" perspective and horizon, the densely packed figures and, especially, a pictorial narrative that moves logically across the areas of the image in the "Crucifixion" panel. Belting and Eichberger believe this style was employed during the early panel works, but was largely abandoned by the 1430s.

The 1430s dating is supported by the style of the <a href="underdrawing">underdrawing</a>, which is consistent with known signed works by van Eyck from that time. In addition, the figures are dressed in clothes fashionable in the 1420s with the exception of one of the possible donors, tentatively identified as <a href="Margaret%20of%20Bavaria">Margaret of Bavaria</a>, who is depicted as the sybil standing in the right foreground of the crucifixion panel and wears clothes in style in the early 1430s.

The upper portions of the "Last Judgement" panel are generally considered as the work of a weaker painter with a less individual style. It is thought that van Eyck left the panels unfinished with completed underdrawings, and the area was finished by workshop members or by followers after he died. <a href="Maryan%20Ainsworth">Maryan Ainsworth</a> of the Metropolitan takes a different view. She highlights the close relationship known to have existed between contemporary workshops in the Low Countries and France, and speculates that a French miniaturist or <a href="Illuminated%20manuscript">illuminator</a>, perhaps from the workshop of the <a href="Bedford%20Master">Bedford Master</a>, travelled to Bruges to assist van Eyck on the right hand panel.

Nothing is known of the work's provenance before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across all areas of the panels.

Writing in 1841 in the journal "Kunstblatt", Passavant gave an account of how the panels were bought at auction from either a Spanish monastery or convent. The Russian diplomat <a href="Dmitry%20Tatishchev">Dmitry Tatishchev</a> acquired the panels, possibly from a Spanish convent or monastery near Madrid or <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a>, while living in Spain between 1814 and 1821. Tatishchev left his pictures to <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Tsar Nicholas I</a> in 1845, and they came into the possession of the Hermitage Gallery in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> in 1917.

The panels were included in the <a href="Soviet%20sale%20of%20Hermitage%20paintings">Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings</a>, which included another important van Eyck work, the 1434–1436 "<a href="Annunciation%20%28van%20Eyck%2C%20Washington%29">Annunciation</a>". They were purchased by Charles Henschel of New York art dealer <a href="M.%20Knoedler%20%26amp%3B%20Company">M. Knoedler & Company</a> for $185,000, significantly less than the asking price of $600,000 when the works were offered in 1931. The panels were shipped from Saint Petersburg to the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin before M. Knoedler & Company sold them on to the Metropolitan in New York that year.

Gravity Bone

Gravity Bone is a <a href="freeware">freeware</a> <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> <a href="Adventure%20game">adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Blendo%20Games">Blendo Games</a>, and released on August 28, 2008. The game employs a modified version of <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>'s <a href="id%20Tech%202">id Tech 2</a> engine—originally used for "<a href="Quake%202">Quake 2</a>"—and incorporates music from films by <a href="film%20director">director</a> <a href="Wong%20Kar-wai">Wong Kar-wai</a>, which were originally performed by <a href="Xavier%20Cugat">Xavier Cugat</a>. Four incarnations of the game were produced during its one-year development; the first featured more common <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> elements than the released version. Subsequent versions shifted in a new direction, with the inclusion of more spy-oriented gameplay.

"Gravity Bone" received critical acclaim from <a href="Video%20game%20journalism">video game journalists</a>. It was called "a pleasure to experience" by Charles Onyett from <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, and received comparisons to games such as "<a href="Team%20Fortress%202">Team Fortress 2</a>" and "<a href="Portal%20%28video%20game%29">Portal</a>". The game was praised for its cohesive story, atmosphere and its ability to catch the player's interest over a very short time span without feeling rushed or incomplete. It received the "Best Arthouse Game" award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008. A sequel, "<a href="Thirty%20Flights%20of%20Loving">Thirty Flights of Loving</a>", was released in 2012.

"Gravity Bone" is a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> <a href="Adventure%20game">adventure</a> video game that lasts around 20 minutes, and is set in the fictional city of Nuevos Aires. The player controls an unnamed spy, and is tasked with accomplishing several missions across the game's two <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">stages</a>. At the end of the game, the player-controlled spy is killed by an unknown woman after chasing her through the last half of the second level. The game was designed to leave the player without a clear idea of how the game's story evolves.

During these missions, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects and environments in the game. The tutorial system used to demonstrate routine gameplay elements such as object interaction and movement is disguised as the first level of "Gravity Bone". Here, the player is tasked with the delivery of a contaminated drink to an unspecified <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>. After the first level is completed, the player is sent to the second level of the game, which follows the pattern of the first; the player is assigned a set of actions and goals involving <a href="Platforming%20game">platforming sequences</a>.

"Gravity Bone" was developed by Brendon Chung under his video game studio <a href="Blendo%20Games">Blendo Games</a>. Chung, who worked as a <a href="level%20designer">level designer</a> for <a href="Pandemic%20Studios">Pandemic Studios</a>, has contributed to the development of titles such as "<a href="Full%20Spectrum%20Warrior">Full Spectrum Warrior</a>" and "". Four incarnations of "Gravity Bone" were produced during its one-year development. Chung commented during an interview with FidGit that ""Gravity Bone" started out very different from what it was and ended up getting scrapped ... so on and so forth until this version came out." The first version of "Gravity Bone" featured more typical first-person shooter elements than the released version, and was based on a series of "<a href="Quake%202">Quake 2</a>" maps entitled Citizen Abel. He elaborated that the first version of the game had the player running around with a gun, "shoot[ing] things and stuff explodes." Development shifted in a new direction, and "Gravity Bone" was transformed; the player would act as a <a href="computer%20hacker">computer hacker</a>, "hacking stuff all the time."

Most of the original first-person shooter elements were removed by the third revision of the game, which incorporated a more spy-oriented style of gameplay, with the player "trying to quietly take out enemies and not be seen." Chung commented that he reworked the game several more times to fit his vision: "It kept on just changing and changing and changing until it got into a more story-oriented direction." He stated that he did not feel comfortable developing "Gravity Bone" as a first-person shooter game, and kept adding "bits and bits of more and more unconventional" elements as a result. He explained that he "got stuck on this idea of the hero never fires a gun, but he just has a bunch of tools on his belt, like a power drill or a can of pressurized <a href="Freon">Freon</a>, a <a href="screwdriver">screwdriver</a>. I thought that was kind of funny and interesting."

"Gravity Bone" was developed using a modified version of <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>'s <a href="id%20Tech%202">id Tech 2</a>, the <a href="game%20engine">graphics engine</a> for "Quake 2". Chung acknowledged that although he has worked with newer, "powerful and flexible" engines, he preferred the older engine because it was released as an <a href="open%20source%20platform">open source platform</a>, "so you can redistribute it for free." The voice work featured in the briefings in "Gravity Bone" was produced using <a href="text-to-speech">text-to-speech</a> programs, and the game incorporates three songs by <a href="Xavier%20Cugat">Xavier Cugat and His Orchesetra</a>: "Maria Elena", "Brazil", and "Perfidia". These versions of "Maria Elena" and "Perfidia" were both previously used by <a href="film%20director">film director</a> <a href="Wong%20Kar-wai">Wong Kar-wai</a> in the 1990 film "<a href="Days%20of%20Being%20Wild">Days of Being Wild</a>". Chung declared that his passion for Wong's films were an important factor in the selection of Wong's music: "He makes these really beautiful films and I've always wanted to use the same music in a videogame." He said that Wong's films had a strong influence on the development of the game.
Charles Onyett from <a href="IGN">IGN</a> applauded "Gravity Bone", saying that it is "a game that appears to toy with the notions of heroism and villainy, and the ways the player identifies with, and is directed toward, both roles." He praised all aspects of the game, commenting, "the cohesiveness of its striking visual presentation, soundtrack and effects, and almost entirely incomprehensible story combine to create an atmosphere of peculiar strength." Onyett concluded his preview of the game by stating, "it's a pleasure to experience, and never ceases to delight and surprise over its short run." Anthony Burch from <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> gave a positive review, stating that it "is so stylistically unified, so consistently cool and weird and imaginative, that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love with—even as the game ends and you're wondering what the hell happened, and why." He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game, expressing appreciation for the game's "stylistic choices", as well as the "nigh unbelievable" <a href="bloom%20%28shader%20effect%29">bloom effects</a> featured in the game. Burch concluded that "Gravity Bone" is "a great ride", and that the "atmosphere and style alone will barrel you through to the journey's end, which comes all too soon."

Derek Yu from The Indie Games Source compared the game with "<a href="Portal%20%28video%20game%29">Portal</a>" and stated that Chung was able to develop "an impeccable flair for graphic design" while manufacturing "Gravity Bone". He concluded that the game is "bursting with delicious color, and features blocky-headed characters that are infinitely more interesting to look at and interact with than the frightening Realdolls game players are often forced to contend with in modern FPS's." Yu elaborated that it had "enough panache in its two levels to make it somewhat of an indie sleeper hit of the end of 2008." An editor from The Refined Geek was pleased with "Gravity Bone" and its sequel, "Thirty Flights of Loving", awarding them each a score of 8 out of 10 and stating, "the enjoyment from these games comes from noticing all the subtle environmental clues and then using your imagination to draw the connecting dots." The editor commented that both games highlight story elements over graphics and technical innovations, saying each game's "true strength comes from its ability to tell a story in the extremely short time frame."

Kirk Hamilton of <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> praised the game, writing, "if you own a PC, you owe it to yourself to play "Gravity Bone"." He said the game was "one of the coolest things I've played on PC lately." Kieron Gillen from <a href="Rock%20Paper%20Shotgun">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> considered "Gravity Bone" to be an intellectual mix of "<a href="Hitman%20%28franchise%29">Hitman</a>", "", and "<a href="Team%20Fortress%202">Team Fortress 2</a>", stating that it is the "wittiest game" he has played since "<a href="World%20of%20Goo">World of Goo</a>". Gillen applauded every aspect of the game, stating that "Gravity Bone" was an "indie <a href="art%20game">art game</a> whose main effect is to delight you at every turn." It received the "Best Arthouse Game" award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008.

A sequel to "Gravity Bone", "<a href="Thirty%20Flights%20of%20Loving">Thirty Flights of Loving</a>", was announced as a reward for contributing to the <a href="Idle%20Thumbs">Idle Thumbs</a> podcast revival <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>. The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012, and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam, which included "Gravity Bone" as an additional feature. The game, though not a direct sequel in story to "Gravity Bone", follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong. The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, who called the very short but non-linear storytelling of "Thirty Flights" a novel use of the video game medium.

Due to the <a href="source%20code">source code</a> availability under the <a href="GPL">GPL</a> the game was later <a href="Source%20port">ported</a> by game enthusiasts to other platforms, like <a href="Linux">Linux</a> and the <a href="OpenPandora">OpenPandora</a> <a href="Handheld%20game%20console">handheld</a>.

The American Bible Challenge

The American Bible Challenge is a <a href="Bible">biblical</a>-themed American television <a href="game%20show">game show</a> created by <a href="Game%20Show%20Network">Game Show Network</a>. The series is hosted by comedian <a href="Jeff%20Foxworthy">Jeff Foxworthy</a>, with gospel musician <a href="Kirk%20Franklin">Kirk Franklin</a> joining Foxworthy as co-host and announcer in the second season. The series debuted on August 23, 2012.

Each season of the series is played as a nine-episode tournament with six episodes of opening rounds, two semi-finals, and a final. Each opening round starts with three teams of three contestants answering questions about the Bible. The teams then nominate their strongest contestants to answer questions by themselves without any assistance from their teammates. After this part of the round, the third-placed team is eliminated and the two highest-scoring teams compete in a final round with the scores being reset to zero. The remaining teams answer as many questions correctly as possible within one minute, and the highest-scoring team from this round wins a $20,000 prize which is given to the team's nominated charity. The winning team then advances to a semi-final game against two other winning teams; the winning team from this game advances to a final game where the grand prize is raised to $100,000. Thus, the team that wins the season-long tournament earns a total of $140,000 for their charity.

The show became the highest-rated original program in the history of Game Show Network. In 2014, "The American Bible Challenge" received two nominations at the <a href="41st%20Daytime%20Emmy%20Awards">41st Daytime Emmy Awards</a>: one for the series as <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Game%20Show">Outstanding Game Show</a> and the other for Foxworthy as <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Game%20Show%20Host">Outstanding Game Show Host</a>; they lost to "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>" and <a href="Steve%20Harvey">Steve Harvey</a> (host of "<a href="Family%20Feud">Family Feud</a>") respectively.

To begin the game, a category is revealed, and the three teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 10 points; an incorrect answer loses 10 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must wait until after the host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.

Each team then participates in a physical stunt that involves teams using common household items to answer questions about biblical figures. For example, in the game Stick a Fork In It, the teams must answer the question by using a spoon to catapult a fork into one of several glasses labeled with different possible answers. Where teams compete individually, each team is given 60 seconds; occasional games where teams compete at the same time are either untimed (with the first team to complete the game winning) or played in 90 seconds. In all cases, the team that wins the stunt receives 20 points; in case of a tie, each of the teams involved in the tie receives the points. The next round, entitled Kirk's Righteous Remix, features <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>–winner <a href="Kirk%20Franklin">Kirk Franklin</a> and a choir singing songs relating to various books of the Bible. Each team is then given one question based on an announced subject worth 30 points; no penalty is assessed for an incorrect answer.

The teams then set their strongest respective contestants aside for the final round of main gameplay, entitled The Chosen Three. These contestants move to an area behind the teams, and cannot participate in this round. The host then asks each team, in turn, a question based on an announced category. Each question in this round is worth 50 points, with no penalty assessed for an incorrect answer. Only the two contestants standing at the podium may confer and answer the question. Two questions are asked to each team in this round. In the Chosen Three round, the contestants who were set aside from the previous round stand alone at their podiums, with their teammates standing in the area behind them. The host asks each contestant, in turn, a question with six possible answers, three of which are correct. The contestants then make three selections without conferring with the rest of their respective teams. Each individual correct answer is worth 100 points, thus, a total of 300 points are available to each team in this round. The two teams with the highest total scores advance to the final round, while the third-place team is eliminated and leaves with $2,500 for their charity.

Before the final round of regular gameplay, entitled The Final Revelation, both teams' scores from the main game are discarded. The host announces the category for the final round, and gives each team a copy of the Bible. The teams then move to a backstage area, and are permitted up to ten minutes to study the Bible for information based on that category. In season two, while backstage, the teams also have the option to use the <a href="YouVersion">YouVersion</a> <a href="mobile%20app">mobile app</a> of the Bible on an electronic tablet along with their physical copy of the Bible.

After the ten minutes, the first team comes on-stage, while the second team is placed in a sound-proof booth. The host then asks the team questions from the announced category. Each question is given, in rotation, to one player, who cannot confer with teammates. Both teams play the same set of questions. Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible, and the team that answers more questions correctly wins $20,000 for their charity; the runners-up win $5,000 for their charity. Teams that win this round advance to a semi-final game; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale, where the team that wins this round wins $100,000 for their charity as well as all winnings from previous episodes.

Immediately following the first round in season two, each team had a chance to earn 25 additional points. Before the show, a question was asked to 100 YouVersion users (e.g. "Would you rather fast for 40 days or eat manna for 40 years?"). A question with three possible choices was then asked about the percentage of people who answered (e.g. "What percentage said they would rather fast for 40 days than eat manna for 40 years?"). During the break, each team wrote their answer on a tablet computer, and each team that submitted the correct answer earned 25 points. This round was removed from the game in the third season and replaced with another opening round-style game played for ± 10 points a question.

Following the second round in season one, teams had to choose the apocryphal verse from three true Bible verses. Since scoring was disappointingly low, this round was eliminated in later shows.

The series began development with production staff approaching Troy Schmidt, a pastor at First Baptist Church in <a href="Windermere%2C%20Florida">Windermere, Florida</a>, to work as both a writer and a consultant for the show. One of Schmidt's initial roles was to be an "on-camera Bible expert" for the series, one of many aspects of the pilot episode that a test audience rejected, and one with which Schmidt himself later admitted he was not comfortable. In response to the early criticism from the test audience, Game Show Network (GSN) took a six-week period to bring in several new staff members and make various changes to the show's format.

After these changes were made, the test audience became more appreciative of the series, and GSN announced its development to the public at an upfront presentation in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on March 21, 2012, for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot; which was hosted by American stand-up comedian and television personality <a href="Jeff%20Foxworthy">Jeff Foxworthy</a>. When first asked if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of "<a href="Beat%20the%20Chefs">Beat the Chefs</a>".

The first season of "The American Bible Challenge" premiered its first of nine episodes on August 23, 2012. An audience of 1.730 million viewers watched the debut episode, making it GSN's highest-rated original program in its history. In total, when combined with a rerun of the episode later that evening, the show brought in over 2.3 million viewers (1.730 million at 8:00 pm; 571,000 at 11:00 pm) for the night. On October 18, 2012, Team Judson's Legacy, consisting of married couple Drake and Christina Levasheff of <a href="Irvine%2C%20California">Irvine, California</a> and their friend Dean Bobar, were crowned champions of the inaugural season's tournament, winning a total of $140,000 for Hunter's Hope, a <a href="leukodystrophy">leukodystrophy</a> charity, chosen in honor of the Levasheffs' son, Judson, who had died in 2007 of late-onset <a href="Krabbe%20disease">Krabbe disease</a>. By the end of the first season, the series had become GSN's most successful original program ever, garnering a total of over 13 million total viewers.

A second nine-episode season of the series was announced on October 9, 2012. GSN advertised that auditions would be held nationwide in November and December, and that the season would also feature the addition of Franklin to the series. The second season premiered on GSN March 21, debuting to 1.152 million viewers. On May 23, 2013, Team Wagner Warriors, consisting of brothers Joshua, Jesse and Daniel Wagner from <a href="Owasso%2C%20Oklahoma">Owasso</a> and <a href="Tulsa%2C%20Oklahoma">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>, were crowned champions of the second season, winning a total of $140,000 for Wagner Ministries International, a missionary organisation founded by their father. A portion of the winnings was used for Wagner Ministries' involvement in the "One Nation One Day" evangelical event in Honduras in July 2013.

On August 8, 2013, GSN announced plans to renew "The American Bible Challenge" for a third season, with both Foxworthy and Franklin returning as hosts. The third season once again consisted of nine episodes, which began airing May 22, 2014. On July 17, 2014, Team Bible Belts, consisting of Jonathan King, Matt Phipps and Brad Harris from <a href="Otway%2C%20Ohio">Otway, Ohio</a>, were crowned as the third season's champions, winning a total $140,000 for Kicks for Jesus, a nonprofit which combines Bible study and <a href="taekwondo">taekwondo</a>. While GSN never canceled the series, the third season remains the most recent season to air given the lack of production and series announcements since 2014.

David Hinckley of the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" gave "The American Bible Challenge" a positive review, saying, "Anyone who knows even a little about the Bible will be unable to resist playing along and matching answers with the teams on the screen." <a href="Neil%20Genzlinger">Neil Genzlinger</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" was also pleased, calling the show "nothing if not magnanimous, sending even the losing teams home with a little something for their charities. A spirit of good will prevails." <a href="Hank%20Stuever">Hank Stuever</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" was critical, calling the series "just as dull as it sounds," and arguing that "weariness" could be detected in Foxworthy's hosting. Rebecca Cusey of <a href="Patheos">Patheos</a> recommended the series for Christians in particular, saying, "Those that take the Bible as the word of God will enjoy this show." Additionally, <a href="Bounce%20TV">Bounce TV</a> expressed excitement when announcing their acquisition of the series in 2013; network <a href="chief%20operating%20officer">chief operating officer</a> Jonathan Katz commented, "We are very confident that the broadcast premieres of "The American Bible Challenge" and "<a href="Catch%2021">Catch 21</a>" will add fuel to Bounce TV’s skyrocketing growth."

The series was honored with two <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> nominations at the <a href="41st%20Daytime%20Emmy%20Awards">41st Daytime Emmy Awards</a> in 2014. The series received a nomination for <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Game%20Show">Outstanding Game Show</a>, while Foxworthy received one for <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Game%20Show%20Host">Outstanding Game Show Host</a>. Both the show and Foxworthy lost to "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>" and <a href="Steve%20Harvey">Steve Harvey</a> of "<a href="Family%20Feud">Family Feud</a>" respectively.

In an effort to promote the show's second season, Schmidt released a study book entitled "The American Bible Challenge: A Daily Reader, Volume 1" in 2013. The book features nine weeks worth of study and questions previously seen on the show. Each day introduces a different lesson and passage of Christian scripture, with five questions being asked at the end of the day's lesson. An online Bible study was also launched on GSN's website at the start of the second season. In addition to the Bible studies, GSN released a mobile game based on the show for <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="iOS">iOS</a> devices, and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> devices in 2012, while Talicor released a board game based on the series in 2014.

Léal Souvenir

Léal Souvenir (also known as Timotheus or Portrait of a Man) is a small <a href="oil%20painting">oil-on-oak</a> <a href="panel%20painting">panel portrait</a> by the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>, dated 1432. The sitter has not been identified, but his highly individual features suggest a historical person rather than the hypothetical ideal usual at the time in northern <a href="Renaissance%20art">Renaissance</a> portraiture; his slight and unassuming torso is contrasted with a sophisticated facial expression. His features have been described as "plain and rustic", yet thoughtful and inward-looking. A number of art historians, including <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a>, have detected mournfulness in his expression. The sitter was apparently significant enough a member of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundian duke</a> <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a>'s circle that his court painter portrayed him.

The man sits before an imitation <a href="parapet">parapet</a> with three sets of painted inscriptions, each rendered to look as if chiselled or scratched into stone. Van Eyck did not have full command of either <a href="Ancient%20Greek">classical Greek</a> or <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and made errors, so readings by modern scholars vary. The first inscription is in Greek and seems to spell "TYΜ.ωΘΕΟC", which has not been satisfactorily interpreted but has led some to title the work "Timotheus". The middle reads in French ""Leal Souvenir"" ("Loyal Memory") and indicates that the portrait is a posthumous commemoration. The third records van Eyck's signature and the date of execution. The 19th-century art historian <a href="Hippolyte%20Fierens-Gevaert">Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert</a> identified the lettering "TYΜ.ωΘΕΟC" with the Greek musician <a href="Timotheus%20of%20Miletus">Timotheus of Miletus</a>. Panofsky drew the same conclusion, eliminating other Greeks bearing the name Timothy; they were of religious or military background, professions that do not match the civilian dress of the sitter. Panofsky believed the man was probably a highly placed musician in Philip's court.

More recent research focuses on the legalistic wording in one of the inscriptions, suggesting to some that he was in some way connected to the legal profession, or an employee of <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a>. The panel was acquired in 1857 by the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, London, where it is on permanent display.

"Léal Souvenir" is one of the earliest surviving examples of secular <a href="portrait%20painting">portraiture</a> in medieval European art and one of the earliest extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a> and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early <a href="Renaissance%20art">Renaissance</a> tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth <a href="translucent">translucent</a> surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.

The parapet dominates the portrait, and his head seems oversized compared to his upper body. Some art historians speculate that this is a result of van Eyck's then inexperience; it was only his second known portrait. Meiss speculates that van Eyck may have "los[t] control of [the] design as a whole by indulging his astounding virtuosity."

The decayed <a href="parapet">parapet</a> allows van Eyck to display his skill at mimicking stone chiselling and scarring, and shows the influence of classical Roman <a href="funerary%20art">funerary art</a>, particularly stone memorials. The parapet gives the work <a href="gravitas">gravitas</a>, the chips and cracks conveying a sense of the venerable, or, according to art historian <a href="Elisabeth%20Dhanens">Elisabeth Dhanens</a>, a sense of the "fragility of life or of memory itself".

The man is positioned within an undefined narrow space and set against a flat black background. Typically for vanEyck, the head is large in relation to the torso. He is dressed in typically <a href="Duchy%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundian</a> fashion, with a red robe and a green wool <a href="Chaperon%20%28headgear%29">chaperon</a> with a bourrelet and cornette hanging forward. The headdress is trimmed with fur, fastened with two buttons, and extends to the parapet. His right hand might be holding the end of the cornette. Neither the shape of his head nor his facial features correspond to contemporary standard types, let alone canons of ideal beauty. The sitter appears to be bald, although there are some faint traces of fair hair, leading Erwin Panofsky to conclude that his "countenance is as 'Nordic' as his dress is Burgundian." Though he has neither eyebrows nor stubble, he does have eyelashes that are believed to have been added by a 19th-century restorer. Van Eyck's cool observation of the man's narrow shoulders, pursed lips, and thin eyebrows extends to detailing the moisture on his blue eyes.

Unlike <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, who paid especially close attention to detail in the rendering of his models' fingers, to vanEyck hands were often something of an afterthought. They are generically rendered, do not contain much detail and may have been a later workshop addition. Yet they are very similar to those of the sitter in his 1435 "Portrait of <a href="Baldwin%20of%20Lannoy">Baudouin de Lannoy</a>". The man holds a scroll that might be a legal document, letter, or pamphlet. In his early portraits, vanEyck's sitters are often shown holding objects indicative of their profession. The scroll contains six lines of illegible writing. The abbreviations are more prominent and seem to be in Latin, but may be vernacular.
Light falls from the left, leaving traces of shadow on the side of the man's face, a device commonly found in vanEyck's early portraits. He is youthful, and his face has a soft fleshiness achieved through shallow curves and flowing, harmonious brushstrokes, giving the appearance of a relaxed, warm, and open personality, which Meiss describes as evoking an almost "<a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>esque warmth and sympathy". The sitter is not handsome; he has a flattish face, a stubby yet pointed nose, and prominent cheekbones that might, according to Panofsky, belong to a "<a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flemish</a> peasant". Dhanens describes him as having an honest expression.

A number of art historians have noted the apparent contradiction between the man's plain looks and enigmatic expression. Meiss describes him as "plain and rustic", and finds a resemblance between his rather generic face and a number of figures in the lower portions of the "Adoration of the Lamb" panel in the "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>". Agreeing with Panofsky, he observes a "thoughtfulness on the high, wrinkled forehead, visionary force in the dreamy yet steady eyes, [and] a formidable strength of passion in the wide, firm mouth". According to Panofsky, the man's face is not that of an intellectual, yet he detects a pensive and lonely nature, "the face of one who feels and produces rather than observes and dissects".

The parapet has three horizontal rows of inscriptions; on the upper and lower rows is smaller lettering that is often not visible in reproductions. In places, the Greek characters are unclear and have been subject to much speculation by art historians, not least due to vanEyck's sometimes erratic spelling and unusual spacing.

The top lettering is in chalk white and Greek script that reads . The last character is deliberately concealed by a chip in the imitation stone, a touch described by Panofsky as a "terminal flourish". This makes the meaning of the inscription difficult to discern. A general consensus among art historians is that the final character is a square C or <a href="sigma">sigma</a> sign.

Eastlake's translation is generally accepted. The possibility of it being a variant of "Timothy" has been discounted, as that word was not used in Northern Europe before the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>. There is no Germanic name that might imply a humanistic imitation of a Greek word, so art historians have sought to identify the man from Greek history or legend. Although some have suggested certain <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athenian</a> and <a href="Roman%20Syria">Syrian</a> generals, these have been discounted as the sitter is not wearing military clothing. <a href="Saint%20Timothy">Saint Timothy</a>, first Bishop of <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> and an associate of <a href="Saint%20Paul">Saint Paul</a>, has been suggested but eliminated as the man is not dressed as a high cleric.
The larger middle inscription is in French, using a 12th-century script. It reads "" ("Loyal Remembrance", or "Faithful Souvenir"), and is painted to give the impression that it was carved into the parapet. In 1927 Hippolyte Fierens Gevaert put forward <a href="Timotheus%20of%20Miletus">Timotheus of Miletus</a>, a Greek musician and <a href="dithyrambic">dithyrambic</a> poet born 446. Gevaert held that the portrait was a commemoration of a court artist who had recently died and that the classical reference was intended to flatter his memory. Panofsky largely went with this position in 1949. He speculated that the sitter was the celebrated musician <a href="Gilles%20Binchois">Gilles Binchois</a>, by 1430 a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> at <a href="St.%20Donatian%27s%20Cathedral">St. Donatian's Cathedral</a>, Bruges. Campbell is sceptical, disclaiming that the sitter "is not dressed as a cleric". Other theories include that the man was a Greek or <a href="Lucca">Lucchese</a> merchant, <a href="Henry%20the%20Navigator">Henry the Navigator</a>, <a href="Jean%20I%20de%20Cro%C3%BF">Jean deCroÿ</a> or, less likely, that it is a self-portrait. Though there is much disagreement, it is probable that he was a native French speaker, and a notary, poet, or member of the "Compagnie du Chapel Vert" ("Society of the Green Hat") at <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>. Dhanens rejects the theory that the man was a musician on the basis that vanEyck would have made this explicit, portraying him holding a device or emblem clearly symbolising music. She concludes that he is an accountant or lawyer holding a legal or financial document.

From the first two inscriptions, the panel is generally accepted as a <a href="posthumous%20work">posthumous</a> portrait. Roman tombstones often showed a representation of the deceased behind a parapet with a carved inscription, and vanEyck may have known of these from travels to France. The lower inscription reads "Actu[m] an[n]o d[omi]ni.1432.10.die ocobris.a.ioh[anne] de Eyck" ("These are done in the year of our Lord 1432 on the 10th day of October by Jan vanEyck"). Campbell observes that the phrasing of this extended signature is surprisingly reminiscent of <a href="legalese">legalese</a>, and that vanEyck seems to be reinforcing the idea that the man was a legal professional, who may have worked for the <a href="House%20of%20Valois-Burgundy">Dukes of Burgundy</a>. Jacques Paviot notes that it is written in the Gothic cursive script "<a href="bastarda">bastarda</a>", then favoured by the legal profession. In either case, although he is not grandly dressed and is probably a member of the middle class, he must have been highly regarded in Philip's court, given that such portraits rarely depicted non-nobles.

The panel consists of a single oak board, cut vertically down close to the painted surface. It has a small unpainted area at the upper left. The support's encasing was probably changed in the 19th century; today four of the eight supports are fixed to the edges of the interior borders, forming inner <a href="molding%20%28decorative%29">mouldings</a>. The other four act as inner pins. The varnish is severely degraded, with key areas of paint and ground either removed or overpainted. <a href="Infrared%20photography">Infrared photography</a> of the reverse reveals traces of short vertical <a href="hatching">hatching</a> and underdrawings, but no hint as to the identity of the sitter. Its ground is mostly chalk-based; the pigments are predominantly blacks, red lake, and blues. The final portrait differs in many ways from the underdrawing – the fingers are shorter, the right thumb and the parapet are lower, and the right arm once extended over a larger area. In the final portrait, the ear is elevated, and the scroll occupies a larger pictorial space. Analysis of the pigment shows that the flesh of his face is painted with whites and <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a>, and traced with greys, blacks, blues, and some <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a> over a red-lake glaze.

The portrait is not particularly well preserved. There are yellowish layers of glaze over the face, probably later additions. The varnishes have degraded and lost their original colours. The panel has undergone a number of detrimental retouchings. In some instances, these have altered the sitter's appearance, most especially the removal of strands of fair hair below the chaperon. It has sustained structural damage, especially to the marble on the reverse. The National Gallery repaired some "slight injuries" when it came into their possession in 1857. Campbell notes a number of efforts by later restorers were imperfect and "rather disfiguring", including touchings to the man's nostrils and eyelashes, and the tip of his nose. There is a yellowish glaze over the eyes that seems to be either damage or overpaint. The panel is discoloured overall and suffers from aged and degenerated varnishes that make the original pigments hard to discern.

The painting was widely copied and imitated during the 15thcentury. Near-contemporary copper reproductions are known from <a href="Bergamo">Bergamo</a> and <a href="Turin">Turin</a>. <a href="Petrus%20Christus">Petrus Christus</a> borrowed the illusionistic carving on the parapet for his 1446 "<a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Carthusian">Portrait of a Carthusian</a>". A 1449–1450 portrait of <a href="Marco%20Barbarigo">Marco Barbarigo</a> attributed to a follower of vanEyck is also heavily indebted to "Léal Souvenir" in that it is also unusually tall and narrow, with a large space above the sitter's head.

The painting is first recorded in the notes of <a href="Charles%20Eastlake">Charles Eastlake</a>, the National Gallery's collector and later director, in 1857, the year it was acquired. He mentions that it had been in the possession of the Scottish landscape painter Karl Ross (1816–1858) "before 1854". Like many of vanEyck's works and those of the Early Netherlandish painters in general, the painting's <a href="provenance%23Works%20of%20art%20and%20antiques">provenance</a> is murky before the 19thcentury. When the National Gallery was verifying attribution, the two copper reproductions were noted. The first was found by Eastlake in the collection of the Lochis family of Bergamo in Italy, the second in Turin, belonging to Count Castellane Harrach and described as smaller than the original, and "very weak". Both are now lost.

Ink markings on the marble reverse show a small cross that may record a merchant's mark or emblem. Although it is incomplete and no identification has been made, <a href="William%20Henry%20James%20Weale">W.H.J. Weale</a> detected the mark of "an early Italian, probably Venetian owner". An early provenance in Italy would not imply that the man came from that country; vanEyck's works were often purchased by collectors from that region.

Themes in Maya Angelou's autobiographies

The themes encompassed in African-American writer <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>'s <a href="List%20of%20Maya%20Angelou%20works%23Autobiographies">seven autobiographies</a> include racism, identity, family, and travel. Angelou (1928–2014) is best known for her first autobiography, the critically acclaimed "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" (1969). The rest of the books in her series are "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>" (1974), "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>" (1976), "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20a%20Woman">The Heart of a Woman</a>" (1981), "<a href="All%20God%27s%20Children%20Need%20Traveling%20Shoes">All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes</a>" (1986), "<a href="A%20Song%20Flung%20Up%20to%20Heaven">A Song Flung Up to Heaven</a>" (2002), and "<a href="Mom%20%26amp%3B%20Me%20%26amp%3B%20Mom">Mom & Me & Mom</a>" (2013).

Beginning with "Caged Bird" and ending with her final autobiography, Angelou used the metaphor of a bird, which represented Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and depression, struggling to escape its cage, as described in the <a href="Paul%20Laurence%20Dunbar">Paul Laurence Dunbar</a> poem "Sympathy". Angelou's autobiographies can be placed in the <a href="African-American%20literature">African-American literature</a> tradition of political protest. Their unity underscored one of Angelou's central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. According to scholar Pierre A. Walker, all of Angelou's books described "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". In the course of her autobiographies, her views about Black-white relationships changed and she learned to accept different points of view. Angelou's theme of identity was established from the beginning of her autobiographies, with the opening lines in "Caged Bird", and like other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s, she used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Her original goal was to write about the lives of Black women in America, but it evolved in her later volumes to document the ups and downs of her life.

The theme of family and family relationships—from the character-defining experience of Angelou's parents' abandonment in "Caged Bird" to her relationships with her son, husbands, friends, and lovers—are important in all of her books. As in American autobiography generally and in African-American autobiography specifically, which has its roots in the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a>, travel is another important theme in Angelou's autobiographies. Scholar Yolanda M. Manora called the travel motif in Angelou's autobiographies, beginning in "Caged Bird", "a central metaphor for a psychic mobility". Angelou's autobiographies "stretch time and place", from <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> to Africa and back to the US, and span almost forty years, beginning from the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> to the assassination of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>

The themes encompassing Angelou's seven autobiographies include racism, identity, family, and travel. She is best known for her first autobiography, the critically acclaimed "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" (1969). Angelou did not write "Caged Bird" with the intention of writing a series of autobiographies; critics have "judged the subsequent autobiographies in light of the first". Her series also includes" <a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>" (1974), "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>" (1976), "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20a%20Woman">The Heart of a Woman</a>", (1981), "<a href="All%20God%27s%20Children%20Need%20Traveling%20Shoes">All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes</a>" (1986), "<a href="A%20Song%20Flung%20Up%20to%20Heaven">A Song Flung Up to Heaven</a>" (2002), and "<a href="Mom%20%26amp%3B%20Me%20%26amp%3B%20Mom">Mom & Me & Mom</a>" (2013). Angelou's autobiographies have a distinct style, and "stretch over time and place", from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U.S. They take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>

According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou's autobiographies have been characterized as <a href="autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>, but Lupton disagrees, stating that they conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. Angelou's use of themes, especially that of racism, connects all seven autobiographies. One of her goals, beginning with "Caged Bird", was to incorporate "organic unity" into them, and the events she described were episodic, crafted like a series of short stories, and were placed to emphasize the themes of her books.

Angelou used the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage described in the <a href="Paul%20Laurence%20Dunbar">Paul Laurence Dunbar</a> poem "Sympathy" throughout all of her autobiographies; she used the metaphor in the titles of both "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" and her sixth autobiography "<a href="A%20Song%20Flung%20Up%20to%20Heaven">A Song Flung Up to Heaven</a>". Like elements within a prison narrative, the caged bird represented Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and oppression. This metaphor also invoked the "supposed contradiction of the bird singing in the midst of its struggle". Although reviewer <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> observed that Angelou's witness of the evil in her society, as directed towards Black women, shaped Angelou's young life and informed her views into adulthood., scholar Lynn Z. Bloom asserted that Angelou's autobiographies and lectures, which she called "ranging in tone from warmly humorous to bitterly satiric", have gained a respectful and enthusiastic response from the general public and critics.

Reviewer Daisy Aldan of "World Literature Today" criticized Angelou for harboring "a fanatic hostility expressed toward all white people", but writer Lyman B. Hagen disagreed, stating that like Angelou's friend and mentor <a href="Langston%20Hughes">Langston Hughes</a>, Angelou explained and illuminated the condition of African Americans, but without alienating her readers of any race. Also according to Hagen, Angelou promoted the importance of hard work, a common theme in slave narratives, throughout all her autobiographies, in order to break the African-American stereotype of laziness. Her description of the strong and cohesive Black community of <a href="Stamps%2C%20Arkansas">Stamps</a> demonstrated how African Americans have subverted repressive institutions to withstand racism. Angelou evolved from wishing that she could become white in "Caged Bird" to being "forced to contend with her blackness".

Critic Pierre A. Walker placed Angelou's autobiographies in the <a href="African-American%20literature">African-American literature</a> tradition of political protest written in the years following the <a href="American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement">American Civil Rights Movement</a>. He emphasized that the unity of Angelou's autobiographies underscored one of her central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. Angelou's biographies, beginning with "Caged Bird", consisted of "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". This sequence led Angelou, as the protagonist, from "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest" throughout all seven of her autobiographies. Angelou changed her views in the course of her autobiographies about Black-white relationships and learned to accept different points of view. It was changes in how she regarded race, and her views of white people, that provided Angelou with freedom. According to Hagen, one of Angelou's themes was that humans tend to be more alike than different.

Angelou's goal, beginning with "Caged Bird", was to "tell the truth about the lives of black women". Like her other autobiographies, she described her living arrangements, how she coped within the context of a larger white society, and the ways that her story played out within that context. Critic <a href="Selwyn%20Cudjoe">Selwyn Cudjoe</a> stated that in Angelou's second autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", Angelou was concerned with the questions of what it meant to be a Black female in the U.S., but focuses upon herself at a certain point in history, in the years immediately following World War II. The book began with a prologue describing the confusion and disillusionment of the African-American community during that time, which matched the alienated and fragmented nature of the main character's life. According to critic Dolly A. McPherson, African Americans were promised a new racial order that never materialized. Angelou also compares and contrasts how she and her grandmother dealt with racism; Angelou with defiance and the pragmatic take of her grandmother, who had learned that defiance was dangerous.

In Angelou's third autobiography "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>", in which she married a white man, she came into intimate contact with whites for the first time—whites very different from the racist people she encountered in her childhood. She discovered that her stereotypes of whites were developed to protect herself from their cruelty and indifference. As McPherson indicated, "Conditioned by earlier experiences, Angelou distrusts everyone, especially whites. Nevertheless, she is repeatedly surprised by the kindness and goodwill of many whites she meets, and, thus, her suspicions begin to soften into understanding". Cudjoe wrote that in "Singin' and Swingin"', Angelou effectively demonstrated "the inviolability of the African American personhood", as well as her own closely guarded defense of it. In order for her to have any positive relationships with whites and people of other races; however, McPherson insisted that Angelou "must examine and discard her stereotypical views about Whites".

Scholar Lyman B. Hagen agreed and pointed out that Angelou had to re-examine her lingering prejudices when faced with the broader world full of whites. The stories she tells in "Singin' and Swingin"' contain "strong forceful statements that convey firmly her indignation and ire about black displacement". For example, when she married Tosh Angelos, against her mother's advice and wishes, she experienced negative reactions from others. Although Tosh treated her and Guy well at the beginning of their marriage, he quickly tired of their relationship and she felt used and betrayed by another white man. Angelou moved between the white and Black worlds, both defining herself as a member of her community and encountering whites in "a much fuller, more sensuous manner". She described the tension she experienced, as a Black female entertainer, functioning in the white-dominated world of the 1950s. Her perceptions of relationships between Blacks and whites had to be constantly modified, despite the attitudes and ideas about whites she learned from her mother and grandmother. Angelou's feelings about race and racism were ambivalent, even though most of her experiences with whites were positive during this time.

Angelou's fourth autobiography, "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20a%20Woman">The Heart of a Woman</a>", opened with Angelou and her son Guy living in an experimental commune with whites, in an attempt to participate in the new openness between Blacks and whites. She was not completely comfortable with the arrangement, however; as Lupton pointed out, Angelou was still distrustful of whites and never named or described the characters of her roommates. For the most part, Angelou was able to freely interact with whites in this book, but she occasionally encountered prejudice similar to earlier episodes, like when she required the assistance of white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood. Lupton stated that compared to her other books, Angelou had come "a long way" from her interactions with whites and people of other races. She remained suspicious of white liberals, but reported on Dr. <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King">Martin Luther King</a>'s optimism about race relations and other positive interactions with whites. Angelou continued, however, her indictment of th white power structure and her protests against racial injustice that had been a theme throughout all her books. Instead of offering solutions, however, she simply reported on, reacted to, and dramatized events.

Angelou became more "politicized" in "The Heart of Woman", and developed a new sense of Black identity. McPherson argued that even Angelou's decision to leave show business was political, and regarded this book as "a social and cultural history of Black Americans" during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Angelou saw herself as a historian of both the Civil Rights Movement and the Black literary movement of the time. She became more attracted to the causes of Black militants, both in the U.S. and in Africa, to the point of entering into a relationship with South African freedom fighter <a href="Vusumzi%20Make">Vusumzi Make</a>, and became more committed to activism. She became an active political protester during this period, but she did not think of herself in that way. Instead, the focus was on herself, and she used the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the Civil Rights Movement influenced one person involved in it. According to Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">SCLC</a> organizer were successful and effective.

According to Lupton, "Angelou's exploration of her African and African-American identities" was an important theme in her fifth autobiography" <a href="All%20God%27s%20Children%20Need%20Traveling%20Shoes">All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes</a>". The alliances and relationships with those she met in <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> contributed to Angelou's identity and growth. Her experiences as an expatriate helped her come to terms with her personal and historical past, and by the end of the book she was ready to return to America with a deeper understanding of both the African and American parts of her character. McPherson called Angelou's parallels and connections between Africa and America her "<a href="double%20consciousness">double-consciousness</a>", which contributed to her understanding of herself.

In "Traveling Shoes", Angelou was able to recognize similarities between African and African-American culture; as Lupton put it, the "blue songs, shouts, and gospels" she has grown up with in America "echo the rhythms of West Africa". Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, writing in "A Glorious Celebration", the book published in 2008 for Angelou's 80th birthday, agreed, stating that Angelou recognized the connections between African and American Black cultures, including the children's games, the folklore, the spoken and non-verbal languages, the food, sensibilities, and behavior. She connected the behavior of many African mother figures, especially their generosity, with her grandmother's actions. In one of the most significant sections of "Traveling Shoes", Angelou recounted an encounter with a West African woman who recognized her, on the basis of her appearance, as a member of the <a href="Bambara%20people">Bambara</a> group of West Africa. These and other experiences in Ghana demonstrated Angelou's maturity, as a mother able to let go of her adult son, as a woman no longer dependent upon a man, and as an American able to "perceive the roots of her identity" and how they affected her personality.
Also in "Traveling Shoes", Angelou came to terms with her difficult past, both as a descendant of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African America who had experienced racism. As she told an interviewer, she brought her son to Ghana to protect him from the negative effects of racism because she did not think he had the tools to withstand them. For the first time in their lives, she and Guy did not "feel threatened by racial hate" in Ghana. The theme of racism was still an important theme in "Traveling Shoes", but she has matured in the way she dealt with it. As Hagen stated, Angelou was "not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed". This was demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the "genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading", something that has often been overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers. Angelou was taught an important lesson about combating racism by <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>, who compared it to a mountain in which everyone's efforts was needed to overcome it.

Angelou learned about herself and about racism throughout "Traveling Shoes", even during her brief tour of Venice and Berlin for the revival of "<a href="The%20Blacks%20%28play%29">The Blacks</a>", the play by <a href="Jean%20Genet">Jean Genet</a> that Angelou had originally performed in 1961; reuniting with the play's original cast, she revived her passion for African-American culture and values, "putting them into perspective" as she compared them with Germany's history of racial prejudice and military aggression. The verbal violence of the folk tales shared during her luncheon with her German hosts and Israeli friend was as significant to Angelou as physical violence, to the point that she became ill. Angelou's experience with fascism in Italy, her performances with "'The Blacks" cast, and the reminders of the holocaust in Germany, "help[ed] shape and broaden her constantly changing vision" regarding racial prejudice, clarified her perceptions of African Americans, and "contribute to her reclaiming herself and her evolution as a citizen of the world".

The theme of identity was established from the beginning of Angelou's series of autobiographies, with the opening lines in "Caged Bird", which "foretell Angelou's autobiographical project: to write the story of the developing black female subject by sharing the tale of one Southern Black girl's becoming". Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Feminist scholar Maria Lauret has made a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret called "fictions of subjectivity" and "feminist first-person narratives", with fictional first-person narratives (such as "<a href="The%20Women%27s%20Room">The Women's Room</a>" by <a href="Marilyn%20French">Marilyn French</a> and "<a href="The%20Golden%20Notebook">The Golden Notebook</a>" by <a href="Doris%20Lessing">Doris Lessing</a>) written during the same period. Both genres employed the narrator as protagonist and used "the illusion of presence in their mode of signification". Scholar Yolanda M. Manora agreed, stating that Angelou broke stereotypes of African-American women by describing these images and stereotypes, and then disproving them, which set the stage for Angelou's identity development in her later autobiographies.

Angelou, as a woman, demonstrated the formation of her own cultural identity throughout her narratives. Angelou presented herself as a role model for African-American women by reconstructing the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and has used her many roles, incarnations, and identities to connect the layers of oppression with her personal history. Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome appeared throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. The women Angelou presented in her autobiographies, especially "Caged Bird", influenced the woman Angelou became. According to Manora, three characters in "Caged Bird", Angelou's mother Vivian, her grandmother Annie Henderson, and Mrs. Flowers (who helps Angelou find her voice again after her rape), collaborated to "form a triad which serves as the critical matrix in which the child is nurtured and sustained during her journey through Southern Black girlhood".

Angelou's original goal was to write about the lives of Black women in America, but her goal evolved in her later volumes to document the ups and downs of her own life. Angelou's autobiographies had the same structure: a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time and how she coped within the context of a larger white society, as well as the ways that her story played out within that context. Angelou, especially in her third autobiography, "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>", successfully demonstrated the integrity of the African-American character as she experienced more positive interactions with whites. In Angelou's second volume, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", Angelou was concerned with what it meant to be a Black female in the U.S., but she focused upon herself at a certain point in history. Writer Selwyn Cudjoe said regarding her second autobiography: "It is almost as though the incidents in the text were simply 'gathered together' under the name of Maya Angelou".

According to scholar Dolly McPherson, the theme of family and family relationships, which she called "kinship concerns", in Angelou's books begins with "a preoccupation with the traditional <a href="nuclear%20family">nuclear family</a>", despite Angelou's experience of being abandoned by her parents in "Caged Bird". Eventually, however, Angelou's concept of family expands to the <a href="extended%20family">extended family</a> in which "trust is the key to a display of kinship concerns". Scholar Mary Jane Lupton insists that the concept of family must be understood in light of Maya and Bailey's displacement. Angelou's description of close familial relationships, such as her relationships with her parents and son (which Lupton called "the mother-child pattern") was the only unifying theme that connected all of her autobiographies. Motherhood was a theme that connected all of Angelou's autobiographies, specifically her experiences as a single mother, a daughter, and a granddaughter. Lupton believed that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by this mother/child motif found in the work of <a href="Harlem%20Renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</a> poet <a href="Jessie%20Fauset">Jessie Fauset</a>.

Scholar Yolanda M. Manora insisted that three women in "Caged Bird"—the "hybridized mother" of Angelou's grandmother, her mother, and her friend Mrs. Flowers—taught her how to be a mother to her son Guy. Although Angelou's grandmother died early in the series, in her third autobiography "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>", Angelou quoted her many times throughout the series. Angelou's desire for security for Guy drove her to marry Tosh Angelos in "Singin' and Swingin"', and drove many of her decisions, job choices, and romantic relationships. Scholar Siphokazi Koyana stated that due to Angelou's race and economic background, her "experience of motherhood is inseparably intertwined with work". According to Koyana, "... Black motherhood always encompassed work". Angelou's long list of occupations attested to the challenges, especially in her second autobiography "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", she faced as a working teenager mother, which often led Angelou to "quick and easy" decisions. Koyana stated that it was not until Angelou was able to take advantage of opportunities, such as her role in "<a href="Porgy%20and%20Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>", when she was able to fully support her and Guy, and the quality of her life and her contribution to society improved. It was impossible, however, for Angelou to become successful without her extended family to provide childcare for her; for example, she left Guy in the care of his grandmother in spite of the conflict and guilt she experienced as a result (something Koyana insisted was imposed on her by the larger society), a pattern established in "Caged Bird" by her own mother when she left Angelou and her brother in the care of Angelou's grandmother.

Black women autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African-American mothers of "breeder and matriarch" and have presented them as having more creative and satisfying roles. According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's autobiographies presented Black women differently from their literary portrayals up to that time. O'Neale maintained that "no Black woman in the world of Angelou's books are losers", and that Angelou was the third generation of intelligent and resourceful women who overcame the obstacles of racism and oppression. Koyana recognized that Angelou depicted women, and what Koyana called Angelou's "womanist theories", in an era of cultural transition, and that her books described one Black woman's attempts to create and maintain a healthy self-esteem. Angelou's experiences as a working-class single mother challenged traditional and Western viewpoints of women and family life, including the nuclear family structure. Angelou described societal forces that eventually expanded to the white family, and that Angelou's strategies of economic survival and experiences of family structure enabled Black families to survive economically.

Travel is a common theme in American autobiography as a whole; as McPherson stated, it is something of a <a href="national%20myth">national myth</a> to Americans as a people. This was also the case for African-American autobiography, which was rooted in and developed out of the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a>. Like the narratives that focused on the writers' search for freedom from bondage, modern African-American autobiographers like Angelou sought to develop "an authentic self" and the freedom to find it in their community. Scholar Yolanda M. Manora called the travel motif in Angelou's autobiographies "fluidity". This fluidity began in "Caged Bird" and was a metaphor for her psychological movements and growth caused by her displacement and trauma throughout the book, something Manora stated Angelou had to escape in order to transcend it. As Hagen stated, Angelou structured "Caged Bird" into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, with both geographic and psychological aspects.

As McPherson stated, "The journey to a distant goal, the return home, and the quest which involves the voyage out, achievement, and return are typical patterns in Black autobiography." For Angelou, this quest took her from her childhood and adolescence, as described in her first two books, into the adult world. The setting in Angelou's first two autobiographies was limited to three places (Arkansas, Missouri, and California), but the "setting breaks open" in "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>" to include Europe as she traveled with her "<a href="Porgy%20and%20Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>" company. McPherson saw Angelou's third autobiography as "a sunny tour of Angelou's twenties", from early years marked by disappointments and humiliation, into the broader world—to the white world and to the international community. This period described "years of joy", as well as the start of Angelou's great success and fulfillment as an entertainer. Lupton stated that Angelou's travel narrative in "Singin' and Swingin'," which took up approximately 40 percent of the book, gave the book its organized structure. Angelou's observations about race, gender, and class made the book more than a simple travel narrative. As a Black American, her travels around the world put her in contact with many nationalities and classes, expanded her experiences beyond her familiar circle of community and family, and complicated her understandings of race relations.

Angelou continued to expand the settings of her autobiographies in her subsequent volumes. "The Heart of a Woman" had three primary settings—the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>—and two secondary ones—<a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Accra">Accra</a>. Lupton stated that like all of Angelou's books, the structure of "The Heart of a Woman" was based upon a journey. Angelou emphasized the theme of movement by opening the book with a spiritual ("The ole ark's a moverin'"), stating, "That ancient spiritual could have been the theme song of the United States in 1957". This spiritual, which contained a reference to <a href="Noah">Noah's</a> ark, presented Angelou as a type of Noah and demonstrated her spirituality. Angelou also mentioned <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> and "<a href="On%20the%20Road">On the Road</a>", the 1951 novel by <a href="Jack%20Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>, thus connecting her own journey and uncertainty about the future with the journeys of literary figures. Even though the reason Angelou traveled to Africa is an eventual failed relationship, she made a connection with the continent, both in this book and in the one that follows it, "<a href="All%20God%27s%20Children%20Need%20Traveling%20Shoes">All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes</a>". As Lupton stated, "Africa is the site of her growth". Angelou's time in Africa made her more aware of her African roots. Lupton insisted, however, that although Angelou journeys to many places in the book, the most important journey she described is "a voyage into the self".

The travel motif is a recurring theme in "Traveling Shoes", as evidenced in the book's title, but Angelou's primary motivation in living in Africa, as she told interviewer <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a> in 1990, was "trying to get home". Angelou not only related her own journey of an African-American woman searching for a home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, whom McPherson compared to the descriptions of white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s by <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>. Angelou's issues were resolved at the end of "Traveling Shoes" when she decided to return to America. She called her departure a "second leave-taking", and compared it to the last time she left her son with his grandmother in "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27">Singin' and Swingin'</a>" when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors. As Lupton states, "Angelou's journey from Africa back to America is in certain ways a restatement of the historical phase known as mid-passage, when slaves were brutally transported in ships from West Africa to the so-called New World". Even though Angelou's sixth autobiography "<a href="A%20Song%20Flung%20Up%20to%20Heaven">A Song Flung Up to Heaven</a>" took place in her home country, the travel motif continued. Reviewer Patricia Elam described "Song" as a "journey through an authentic and artistic life".

The Bread-Winners

The Bread-Winners: A Social Study is an 1883 novel by <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a>, former <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">secretary</a> to <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> who in 1898 became <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. The book takes an anti-<a href="organized%20labor">organized labor</a> stance, and when published anonymously sold well and provoked considerable public interest in determining who the author was.

The plot of the book revolves around former army captain Arthur Farnham, a wealthy resident of Buffland (an analog of <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>). He organizes Civil War veterans to keep the peace when the Bread-winners, a group of lazy and malcontented workers, call a violent <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a>. He is sought in marriage by the ambitious Maud Matchin, daughter of a carpenter, but instead takes a woman of his own class.

Hay wrote his only novel as a reaction to several strikes that affected him and his business interests in the 1870s and early 1880s. Originally published in installments in "<a href="The%20Century%20Magazine">The Century Magazine</a>", the book attracted wide interest. Hay had left hints to his identity in the novel, and some guessed right, but he never acknowledged the book as his, and it did not appear with his name on it until after his death in 1905. Hay's hostile view of organized labor was soon seen as outdated, and the book is best remembered for its onetime popularity and controversial nature.

One of the wealthiest and most cultured residents of the famed Algonquin Avenue in Buffland (a city intended to be <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>), Captain Arthur Farnham is a <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> veteran and widower—his wife died of illness while accompanying him at a remote frontier post. Since he left the army, he has sought to involve himself in municipal affairs, but fails though political naiveté. The victorious party has allowed him the position of chairman of the library board. In that capacity, he is approached by Maud Matchin, daughter of carpenter Saul Matchin, a man content with his lot. His daughter is not, and seeks employment at the library as a means of bettering herself. Farnham agrees to put her case, but is defeated by a majority on the board, who have their own candidate. She finds herself attracted to Farnham, who is more interested in Alice Belding, daughter of his wealthy widow neighbor.

Saul Matchin had hoped that his daughter would become a house servant, but having attended high school, she feels herself too good for that. She is admired by Saul's assistant Sam Sleeny, who lives with the Matchins, a match favored by her father. Sleeny is busy repairing Farnham's outbuildings, and is made jealous by interactions between the captain and Maud. Seeing Sleeny's discontent, Andrew Jackson Offitt (true name <a href="Ananias%20and%20Sapphira">Ananias</a>), a locksmith and "professional reformer", tries to get him to join the Bread-winners, a <a href="labor%20organization">labor organization</a>. Sleeny is happy with his employment, "Old Saul Matchin and me come to an agreement about time and pay, and both of us was suited. Ef he's got his heel into me, I don't feel it," but due to his unhappiness over Maud, is easy game for Offitt, who gets him to join, and to pay the dues that are Offitt's visible means of support.

Maud has become convinced that she is in love with Farnham, and declares it to him. It is not reciprocated, and the scene is witnessed both by Mrs. Belding and by Sleeny. The widow believes Farnham when he states he had given Maud no encouragement, but her daughter, when her mother incautiously tells her of the incident, does not. When Farnham seeks to marry Alice, she turns him down and asks him never to renew the subject.

Offitt's membership has tired of endless talk, and plans a <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a>, a fact of which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is no expense to the city.

Meanwhile, Maud tells her father she will never marry Sleeny. She is wooed by Bott, who is a spiritualist and a Bread-winner, and also by Offitt. Neither meets success, though Offitt dexterously prevents her from actually saying no, and through flattery and stories of his alleged past piques her interest.

By the end of the second day of the strike, which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield [in the serialization, "Clevealo"], the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in turning back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are captured by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.

Offitt, despite being one of the leaders of the assault on the Belding house, has escaped blame and befriends the sullen Sleeny on his release. Upon learning that some workers pay their landlord, Farnham, in the evening of the rent day at his home, Offitt comes up with a scheme—rob and murder Farnham and let Sleeny take the blame as Offitt elopes with Maud. Accordingly, Offitt sneaks into Farnham's house with Sleeny's hammer, but just as he is striking the fatal blow, Alice Belding, who can see what is going on from her house through an opera glass, screams, distracting Offitt enough so that Farnham is hurt by the blow, but not killed. Offitt hurries away with the money, and proceeds to frame Sleeny. After realizing Offitt's treachery, Sleeny escapes jail and kills him. The stolen money is found on Offitt's body, clearing Sleeny in the assault on Farnham, but the carpenter must still stand trial for the killing of Offitt, in which he is aided by partisan testimony from Maud. A sympathetic jury <a href="Jury%20nullification%20in%20the%20United%20States">ignores the law</a> to find him not guilty. Sleeny wins Maud's hand in marriage, and Farnham and Alice Belding are to be wed.

<a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a> was born in Indiana in 1838, and grew up in frontier Illinois. During his apprenticeship to become a lawyer in his uncle's office in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield</a>, he came to know <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, and worked for his presidential campaign in 1860. He was made Lincoln's assistant <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">personal secretary</a>, and spent the years of the American Civil War working for him; the two men forged a close relationship.

After the war, Hay worked for several years in diplomatic posts abroad, then in 1870 became a writer for <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>'s "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>", continuing there under <a href="Whitelaw%20Reid">Whitelaw Reid</a> after Greeley's death in 1872. Hay was a gifted writer for the "Tribune", but also achieved success with literary works. In 1871, he published "<a href="Pike%20County%20Ballads">Pike County Ballads</a>", a group of poems written in the dialect of frontier <a href="Pike%20County%2C%20Illinois">Pike County, Illinois</a>, where Hay had attended school. The same year, he published "Castilian Days", a collection of essays on Spain, some of which had been written while Hay was posted as a diplomat in Madrid.

In 1873, Hay began to woo Clara Stone, daughter of wealthy Cleveland industrialist <a href="Amasa%20Stone">Amasa Stone</a>, and wed her in 1874.
The marriage made Hay wealthy. Hay and his wife moved to Cleveland, where Hay managed Amasa Stone's investments. In December 1876, a train of Stone's <a href="Lake%20Shore%20and%20Michigan%20Southern%20Railway">Lake Shore Railway</a> was crossing a bridge when the structure collapsed. The <a href="Ashtabula%20River%20Railroad%20Disaster">Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster</a>, including the subsequent fire, killed 92 people, the worst rail disaster in American history to that point. Stone held the patent for the design of the bridge and was widely blamed; he left Hay in charge of his businesses in mid-1877 as he went to travel in Europe.

Hay biographer Robert Gale recorded that between the publication of the last of Hay's short fiction in 1871 and that of his only novel in 1883, "Hay married money, entered into a lucrative business arrangement in Cleveland with his conservative father-in-law [and] joined the right wing of the Ohio Republican Party ... "The Bread-Winners" was written by a person made essentially different as a result of these experiences."

Although the American Civil War did not itself transform the United States from a largely agrarian to an urban society, it gave great impetus to a change already under way, especially in the North. The challenges of feeding, clothing, and equipping the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> caused the building or expansion of many factories and other establishments. This made many wealthy, and led to an industrialized America.

This transformation did not stop when the war ended; industrial production in the United States increased by 75% from 1865 to 1873, making the U.S. second only to Britain in manufacturing output. Railroad construction made practical the exploitation of the trans-Mississippi West. Although the railroads helped fuel an economic boom, they proved a two-edged sword in the 1870s. The 1872 <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Mobilier%20of%20America%20scandal">Crédit Mobilier scandal</a>, over graft in the construction of the <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a>, shook the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Grant administration</a> to its highest levels. Railroad bankruptcies in the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a> led to loss of jobs, wage cuts, and business failures. These disturbances culminated in the <a href="Railroad%20Strikes%20of%201877">Railroad Strikes of 1877</a>, when workers struck over cut wages and loss of jobs. The action originally started on the <a href="Baltimore%20%26amp%3B%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore & Ohio Railroad</a>, but spread to other lines, including the Lake Shore, much to Hay's outrage. Federal troops were sent by President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> to quash the strikes, at the cost of over 100 civilian lives. The Lake Shore dispute, unlike those elsewhere, was settled without violence. Hay remained angry, and blamed foreign agitators for the dispute. He condemned the "unarmed rebellion of foreign workingmen, mostly Irish" and informed Stone by letter, "the very devil seems to have entered into the lower classes of working men and there are plenty of scoundrels to encourage them to all lengths."

Public opinion was generally against the strikes in the 1877 disputes and called for them to be ended by force to preserve property and stability. The strike and its suppression featured in many books of the period, such as <a href="Thomas%20Stewart%20Denison">Thomas Stewart Denison</a>'s "An Iron Crown: A Tale of the Great Republic" (1885), with novelists often sympathizing with the demands of the strikers, though decrying their violence. Another labor dispute that likely affected Hay's writing of "The Bread-Winners" was the <a href="Cleveland%20Rolling%20Mill">Cleveland Rolling Mill</a> strike of June 1882, which occurred just before Hay first submitted his manuscript. During the dispute, union members violently attempted to prevent <a href="strikebreaker">strikebreaker</a>s from entering the mills. A third strike that may have affected the final form of "The Bread-Winners" was that against <a href="Western%20Union">Western Union</a> in 1883—Hay was then a director of that corporation.

Gale noted that "The Bread-Winners" has sometimes been characterized as the first <a href="Labour%20movement">anti-labor</a> novel, but it was preceded by <a href="Thomas%20Bailey%20Aldrich">Thomas Bailey Aldrich</a>'s "The Stillwater Tragedy" (1880). Aldrich had little knowledge of workers, and his book was not successful. Nevertheless, "The Stillwater Tragedy" was one of a very few novels to deal with labor unions at all, prior to Hay's book.

Scott Dalrymple, in his journal article on "The Bread-Winners", argues, "the brunt of Hay's ire seems aimed less toward these working men themselves than toward troublesome union organizers. Left to their own devices, Hay believes, most laborers are reasonable creatures". Hay biographers Howard L. Kushner and Anne H. Sherrill agree, writing that the author was attempting "to expose the way in which this class, due to its ignorance, fell prey to the villainies of false social reformers". To Hay, unions were dangerous as they manipulate the uneducated worker; it was better for laborers to work out their pay and conditions individually with their employer, as Sleeny does with Matchin. In his journal article, Frederic Jaher notes that Offitt, a self-described reformer, "is arrogant, tyrannical and self-righteous. Hay's message is clear: the established system needs no basic change; eliminate the agitator and harmony returns."

Offitt, at birth, was given the forenames Andrew Jackson, which according to Hay shows that the bearer "is the son of illiterate parents, with no family pride or affections, but filled with a bitter and savage partisanship which found its expression in a servile worship of the most injurious personality in American history". Hay despised President Jackson and <a href="Jacksonian%20democracy">Jacksonian democracy</a>, which he deemed corrupt and responsible for the continuation of the slave system that Hay saw overthrown at huge cost in the American Civil War. He feared a return to values he deemed anticapitalist, and made the Bread-winners "the laziest and most incapable workmen in town", whose ideals are pre-industrialist and foreign in origin. Hay saw no excuse for violence; as the will of the people could be expressed through the ballot, the remedy for any grievances was the next election. According to Gale, Hay "never loses an opportunity to demean the Irish"—they are depicted as talkative and easily led (Offitt writes for the "Irish Harp"), and the reader is told that "there was not an Irish laborer in the city but knew his way to his <a href="Wards%20of%20the%20United%20States">ward</a> club as well as to mass".

Jaher noted that Hay's view of what a worker should be is summed up in the character of Saul Matchin. Although a successful craftsman, he remains within the working class, not seeking to rise above his station, and is content with his lot. His children are not willing to remain within that class, however: the sons run away and the daughters seek to marry well, symbolizing the change being wrought by industrialization. Robert Dunne points out that the working classes are not depicted favorably in Hay's novel, but as "stupid and ill-bred, at the best loyal servants to the gentry and at the worst overly ambitious and a threat to the welfare of Buffland". Sloane considers unfavorable depictions of the working classes inevitable given the plot, and less noticeable than skewed portrayals of the wealthy in other books of the time.

Farnham and Alice Belding are the two characters in the novel who were never part of the working class, but who are scions of wealth, and they are presented favorably. Other, self-made members of the elite are depicted as more vulgar: Mrs. Belding's indulgence in gossip endangers the budding romance between her daughter and Farnham, while Mr. Temple, though brave and steadfast, can only discuss a few topics, such as horse racing, and his speech is described as peppered with profanities. The rest of Buffland's society, as displayed at a party at Temple's house, is composed of "a group of gossipy matrons, vacuous town belles, and silly swains".

Hay wrote "The Bread-Winners" sometime during the winter or spring of 1881–82. At the time, he was busy with his part of the massive Lincoln biography he was compiling with <a href="John%20Nicolay">John Nicolay</a>, "". His work on the Lincoln project had been delayed by <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a> and attendant medical treatment, and was further delayed by "The Bread-Winners", as once Hay began work on his only novel, he found himself unable to put it aside. The manuscript was completed by June 1882, when he sent it to <a href="Richard%20Watson%20Gilder">Richard Watson Gilder</a>, editor of "<a href="The%20Century%20Magazine">The Century Magazine</a>", though whether he was submitting it for publication or advice is unclear. Gilder called it "a powerful book", but did not immediately offer to publish it in his magazine.

Aside from his family and Gilder, likely the only person who knew that Hay was writing a novel was his friend <a href="Henry%20Adams">Henry Adams</a>. In 1880, Adams had published "", anonymously, and when Hay arrived in Britain in July 1882, he found speculation as to its authorship to be a popular pursuit. Hay sent Adams a copy of a cheap British edition, telling him, "I think of writing a novel in a hurry and printing it as by the author of "Democracy"."

During the summer of 1882, Hay showed the manuscript to his friend, author <a href="William%20Dean%20Howells">William Dean Howells</a>. Howells urged Aldrich, editor of the "<a href="The%20Atlantic">Atlantic Monthly</a>", to publish it. Aldrich agreed, sight unseen, on condition that Hay allow his name to be used as author. Hay was not willing to permit this, and resubmitted the manuscript to Gilder, who agreed to Hay's condition that it be published anonymously. In an anonymous letter to "The Century Magazine" after the book was published, Hay alleged that he chose not to reveal his name because he was engaged in business where his stature would be diminished if it were known he had written a novel. According to Dalrymple, the likely real reason was that if it were published under Hay's name, it would harm his ambitions for office, for "to attack labor overtly, in print, would not have been politically prudent." <a href="Tyler%20Dennett">Tyler Dennett</a>, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, speculated that Hay, in his later career, would not have been confirmed either as ambassador to Great Britain (1897) or as Secretary of State (1898) had senators associated him with "The Bread-Winners".

Although "The Bread-Winners" was published anonymously, Hay left clues to his identity throughout the novel. Farnham leads the library board, as did Hay's father. Hay's brother Leonard served on the frontier, like Farnham; another brother grew exotic flowers, as does Farnham. Algonquin Avenue, analog of Cleveland's <a href="Euclid%20Avenue%20%28Cleveland%29">Euclid Avenue</a> (where Hay lived), is home to the novel's protagonist. In the opening chapter, Farnham's study is described in detail and closely resembles Hay's.

In March 1883, the Century Company circulated a postcard, with copies likely going to newspapers and potential subscribers. Under the heading "Literary Note from The Century Co.", and giving some information about the plot, it announced that an anonymous novel, "unusual in scene and subject, and powerful in treatment" would soon be <a href="Serial%20%28literature%29">serialized</a> in the pages of the "Century". The serial was originally supposed to begin in April or May, but was postponed because <a href="Frances%20Hodgson%20Burnett">Frances Hodgson Burnett</a>'s novel "Through One Administration" ran long. On July 20, the date of release of the August number, the company placed newspaper advertisements for "The Bread-Winners", and stated that "the story ... abounds in local description and social studies, which heighten the interest and continually pique curiosity as to its authorship". "The Bread-Winners" appeared in the "Century" from August 1883 to January 1884, when it was issued as a book by Harper and Brothers.

By July 25, 1883, Cleveland newspapers were taking note of the literary mystery, with initial guesses that the author was some former Clevelander who had moved east. In early August, the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>" reported that the author was the late <a href="Leonard%20Case%2C%20Jr.">Leonard Case</a>, a Cleveland industrialist and philanthropist—the manuscript had supposedly been found among his papers. Few believed the chronically ill and introverted bachelor could have created the vivid portrait of the shapely Maud Matchin. With Case dismissed, speculation turned to other Ohioans, including Cleveland Superintendent of Schools <a href="Burke%20Aaron%20Hinsdale">Burke Aaron Hinsdale</a>, former congressman <a href="Albert%20Gallatin%20Riddle">Albert Gallatin Riddle</a> (author of twelve books), and John Hay. The "<a href="Boston%20Evening%20Transcript">Boston Evening Transcript</a>" on August 18 stated, "we have an idea that none of these guesses are correct". Others suggested that the anonymous author of "Democracy" (Henry Adams's authorship was not yet known) had penned a second controversial work.

The furor fueled sales, with the "Century" later reporting that it gained 20,000 new subscribers because of the serial. The August issue of the "Century", in which the first four chapters were serialized, sold out. The September issue also sold out, but went to a second printing. The "Century" loudly proclaimed these facts in promotional advertisements, and that it was coining money as a result. As the second installment was read, and the character of Alice Belding became prominent, there was speculation in the press that a female hand had written the novel, with suspicion falling on <a href="Constance%20Fenimore%20Woolson">Constance Fenimore Woolson</a> (great-niece of <a href="James%20Fenimore%20Cooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a>), whose novels were set in eastern Ohio. On September 18, the Washington correspondent for the "Evening Transcript" noted the resemblance of Farnham's study to Hay's. Other candidates for the authorship were Howells (though he quickly denied it) and Hay's friend <a href="Clarence%20King">Clarence King</a>, a writer and explorer.
On October 23, 1883, an interview with Hay, who had just returned from a trip to Colorado, appeared in the pages of the "Cleveland Leader". Hay stated that such a novel would be beyond his powers, and that inaccuracies in the depiction of the local scene suggested to him that it was not written by a Clevelander. He offered no candidates who might have written it. Nevertheless, in November, the "Leader" ran a column speculating that Hay was the author, based on phrases used both in "The Bread-Winners" and in Hay's earlier book, "Castilian Days", and by the fact that one character in the novel was from <a href="Salem%2C%20Indiana">Salem, Indiana</a>, Hay's birthplace. Further textual analyses led a number of newspapers in early 1884 (when the novel appeared in book form) to state it had been written by Hay.

Tiring of the guessing game, some newspapers descended to satire. The <a href="The%20Times-Picayune">"New Orleans Daily Picayune"</a> surveyed the lengthy list of candidates and announced that "the authors of "The Bread Winners" will all meet at <a href="Chautauqua">Chautauqua</a> next summer". Another columnist suggested that a statistic be put in the next census for the number of people named as the author. The appearance of <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">President Arthur's</a> <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">annual message to Congress</a> in December 1883 caused the Rochester "Herald" to opine that he had written "The Bread-Winners" "because a careful comparison of his message with the story shows many words common to both". Another <a href="Upstate%20New%20York">Upstate New York</a> paper, the Troy "Times", evoked <a href="Parson%20Weems">Parson Weems</a>'s tales of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>: "We cannot tell a lie. We wrote "The Bread winners" with our own little hatchet. If any one doubts it, we can show him the hatchet." This admission, the <a href="Buffalo%20Courier-Express">Buffalo "Express"</a> felt, should put an end to the discussion.

"The Bread-Winners" received some favorable reviews, such as that by GP Lathrop in "Atlantic Monthly" in May 1884. Lathrop applauded the author's portrayal of the characters, and suggested that Maud Matchin was a notable addition to the "gallery of national types" in American literature. The "Century" reviewed the book the same month, in an article written by Howells, though he signed it only "W". He saw Maud as "the great discovery of the book" and applauded it as a treatment of an area of American life not previously written about. Similarly, a reviewer for "<a href="Harper%27s%20Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a>" liked the parts of the novel set among the lower classes.

According to David E. E. Sloane, "most American critics found it harder to overlook the coarseness of the book and its treatment of the labor problem." A reviewer for "Literary World" in January 1884 called "The Bread-Winners" a "greasy, slangy, malodorous book ... repulsive from the very first step". "The Dial", the following month, praised the author's use of language but deemed the book "a preposterous tissue of incidents" populated by two sets of "exaggerated types", one vicious, the other absurd. "Continent", also in February 1884, suggested that "the criticisms as a whole are severe, and justly so, the book being, with all its brilliancy, faithless and hopeless." The "Springfield Republic" suggested that the author had "no sympathies beyond the circles of wealth and refinement", from which "the workingman is either a murderous ruffian, or a senseless dupe, or a stolid, well-meaning drudge, while the man of wealth is, necessarily, a refined, cultivated hero, handsome, stylish, fascinating". A letter in "The Century Magazine" deemed the novel "a piece of snobbishness imported from England... It is simply untruthful... to continue the assertion that trade unions are mainly controlled and strikes originated by agitators, interested only for what they make out of them".

British critics were generally more favorable toward the book than American. In a column in the "<a href="Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">Pall Mall Gazette</a>", "The Bread-Winners" was seen as "eminently clever and readable, a worthy contribution to that American novel-literature which is at the present day, on the whole, ahead of our own," a statement which Harper's used in advertisements. A reviewer for London's "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">Saturday Review</a>" described the book as "one of the strongest and most striking stories of the last ten years".

Hay's novel provoked several works in response. Ohio Congressman <a href="Martin%20Foran">Martin Foran</a> announced in March 1884 that he would write a book rebutting the author's view of labor, and published it in 1886 under the title "The Other Side". <a href="Harriet%20Boomer%20Barber">Harriet Boomer Barber</a> (writing under the pen name Faith Templeton) kept a number of Hay's characters, while "turning the American industrial world into a sort of Christian utopia" in her "Drafted In" (1888). <a href="Stephen%20Crane">Stephen Crane</a>'s 1895 short story, "A Christmas Dinner Won in Battle" satirizes "The Bread-Winners".
The most successful response was "<a href="The%20Money-Makers">The Money-Makers</a>" (1885), published anonymously by <a href="Henry%20Francis%20Keenan">Henry Francis Keenan</a>, a former colleague of Hay's at the "New-York Tribune". Keenan's work left little doubt that he had fixed on Hay as author of "The Bread-Winners", as it contains characters clearly evoking Hay, his family, and associates. Aaron Grimestone parallels <a href="Amasa%20Stone">Amasa Stone</a>, Hay's father-in-law. When the Academy Opera House collapses, taking hundreds of lives, Grimestone is deemed responsible for its faulty construction—as Stone was for the deaths in the Ashtabula railway disaster. Grimestone eventually commits suicide by shooting himself in his bathroom, as did Stone in 1883. His daughter Eleanor parallels Clara Stone Hay, and Keenan's descriptions of Eleanor make it clear she is, like Clara, heavyset. The character Archibald Hilliard is modeled after Hay, and the description of his appearance is that of Hay even to the mustache. Hilliard was a secretary to a high official in Washington, and later a diplomat and editor, entering journalism in the same year as Hay. Hilliard becomes a brilliant writer at the "Atlas", a reforming New York paper like the "Tribune", under the editorship of Horatio Blackdaw, that is, "Tribune" editor <a href="Whitelaw%20Reid">Whitelaw Reid</a>. Although she is not physically attractive to him, Hilliard woos Eleanor, convincing himself he is not merely a fortune seeker.

When Hay received a copy of "The Money-Makers", according to later accounts, he is said to have hurried to New York to buy up as many copies as he could. He wrote the publisher, <a href="William%20Henry%20Appleton">William Henry Appleton</a>, complaining about the "savage libel" against Amasa Stone. Appleton agreed to several changes, including the manner of suicide, and undertook not to advertise the book further. Later in 1885, a laudatory biographical sketch of Stone, written by "J.H.", appeared in the "Magazine of Western History", attributing Stone's suicide to insomnia. According to Clifford A. Bender in his journal article on the Keenan book, "the principal reason "The Money-Makers" has remained in obscurity seems to be that John Hay suppressed it," and though he deemed it superior to "The Bread-Winners", Dalrymple suggests that Keenan's book "seems more the product of a personal vendetta than an ideological disagreement".

By the standards of the day, "The Bread-Winners" was a modest bestseller, with 25,000 copies sold in the United States by mid-1885. Two editions were published in Britain and a pirated edition in Canada, along with a reported sale of 3,000 in the Australian colonies. Translations were published in French, German, and Swedish. By comparison, Adams's "Democracy" sold only 14,000 copies in the U.S., and took four years to do so. Nevertheless, "The Bread-Winners" did not compare with the leading bestsellers of the 1880s, such as <a href="Lew%20Wallace">Lew Wallace</a>'s "" (1880), which sold 290,000 copies by 1888, and <a href="Edward%20Bellamy">Edward Bellamy</a>'s story of the future, "<a href="Looking%20Backward">Looking Backward</a>" (1887), which sold nearly 1 million copies in its first decade.

John Hay never acknowledged the book, nor was it attributed to him in his lifetime; as Gilder put it, "guessing right isn't finding out". Hay and Adams amused themselves by suggesting that the other might have written it, with Hay writing to his friend, "if you have been guilty of this ... libel upon Cleveland, there is no condonement possible in this or any subsequent worlds". At Hay's death in 1905, obituarists were uncertain whether to assign the novel to him, an exception being "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", which used handwriting analysis to link the book to him, and published it in its entirety over six Sundays later that year. In 1907, with the permission of Clara Hay, the book was officially acknowledged as his, and in 1916 it was republished in John Hay's name, with an introduction by his son, Clarence.

Jaher opined that the book became antiquated as America evolved an understanding of industrial problems, and found Hay's view of labor superficial. Accordingly, the book had little lasting influence, and is remembered only for its onetime popularity and controversy. According to Dalrymple, "the anti-labor novels fail to hold up particularly well. None is a masterpiece of language, plotting, or characterization. Ideologically all seem quite heavy-handed, choosing to make their points with a nearly complete lack of subtlety."

Because of his prominence as a statesman, Hay has had a number of biographers in the century since his death. Sloane suggested that early biographers, aware of the nature of the novel's themes, were defensive in their treatment of it. <a href="Lorenzo%20Sears">Lorenzo Sears</a>, for example, who wrote of Hay in 1915, called "The Bread-Winners" one of several "waifs and strays" of Hay's literary career. Dennett, writing in 1933, deemed the book Hay's honest effort to set forth a problem he could not solve. Other historians were more hostile: <a href="Vernon%20L.%20Parrington">Vernon L. Parrington</a> in 1930 called it a "dishonest book" and "a grotesque fabric smeared with unctuous morality". More recently, Gale (writing in 1978) described it as "a timely, popular and controversial novel that still rewards the sympathetic reader", while Hay's most recent biographer, John Taliaferro (2013) deemed it "certainly no love letter to [Cleveland]".

Roger Norreis

Roger Norreis (died between 1223 and 1225) was <a href="Abbot%20of%20Evesham">Abbot of Evesham</a> in England. He was a controversial figure, installed in several offices against opposition. In his appointment to Evesham he was accused of immoral behaviour and failing to follow monastic rules. In 1202 Norreis became embroiled in a dispute with his monks and his episcopal superior the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>; litigation and argumentation lasted until his deposition in 1213. He then was appointed <a href="prior">prior</a> of a subsidiary monastic house of <a href="Evesham">Evesham</a> but was deposed within months, then re-appointed to the office five years later.

Norreis has been described by modern historians as being unsuited for the religious positions to which he was appointed and by one of being completely unsuitable to hold any kind of spiritual role. Nevertheless, even his most severe contemporary critic, <a href="Thomas%20of%20Marlborough">Thomas of Marlborough</a>, one of his own monks at Evesham, conceded that Norreis was energetic, entertaining, and enterprising; during his time as abbot of <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a> he managed to complete the <a href="crossing%20tower">crossing tower</a> of the monastic church. 

Roger Norreis died between 1223 and 1225.

Norreis was a native of northern England and his family was probably of Norse origin. He was a monk at <a href="Christ%20Church%20Priory">Christ Church Priory</a>, the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>; when he became a monk is unknown. In 1187 he was appointed treasurer of the <a href="priory">priory</a>, and in that role was sent by the cathedral chapter to King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> to plead their case against <a href="Baldwin%20of%20Forde">Baldwin of Forde</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. The archbishop and his monks were in dispute over Baldwin's plan to found a <a href="collegiate%20church">collegiate church</a> at Hackington in honour of <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a> which most of the monks opposed because they feared it would diminish the prestige of their priory.

Once Norreis reached the king he was converted to Baldwin's side, perhaps because of the latter's appointment of Norreis as the <a href="cellarer">cellarer</a> of Christ Church while the pair were at the king's court. The monks resisted this appointment, and in September they appealed to the papacy, arguing that the appointment was against the <a href="Benedictine%20Rule">Benedictine Rule</a>. They also captured and held Norreis in custody, telling anyone who enquired after him that he was sick. Norreis escaped in early 1188 by travelling through the sewer and fled to the safety of the archbishop, who was then at <a href="Otford">Otford</a>. In a mocking reference to his escape route, Norreis was occasionally known as Roger Cloacarius or "Roger the Drain-Cleaner". Baldwin then tried to have Norreis installed as prior at Christ Church's <a href="Priory">dependent priory</a> of <a href="St%20Martin%27s%2C%20Dover">St Martin's, Dover</a>, but the appointment was never confirmed.

King Henry died on 6 July 1189 and his son <a href="Richard%20I">Richard I</a> was crowned on 3 September. The succession of a new monarch eventually allowed a truce in the dispute between the Canterbury monks and their archbishop, as Henry had been a supporter of the archbishop's scheme. Before the truce could be hammered out, Baldwin appointed Norreis as prior of Christ Church in October 1189 as another move in the quarrel over the Hackington project. In November the cathedral chapter secured a compromise that included the abandonment of the scheme and Norreis's dismissal from office. The agreement came at a council held by Richard in late November 1189 at which the monks agreed to let the king settle the dispute over the Hackington project if the archbishop would withdraw Norreis's appointment. Norreis's fellow monks considered him a traitor to their cause, and his reputation was that of someone with few morals. He was also known for ingratiating himself with those in power, including the <a href="justiciar">justiciar</a> <a href="Geoffrey%20Fitz%20Peter%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Geoffrey fitzPeter</a>. Many of the details concerning Norreis's career at Christ Church come from the works of <a href="Gervase%20of%20Canterbury">Gervase of Canterbury</a>, as well as the collection of letters known as the "Epistolae Cantuarienses".

Norreis was appointed to the abbacy of <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a> in 1190 and was blessed as abbot on 13 January 1190. He owed his appointment to King Richard and to Baldwin's attempts to make the dismissal from Christ Church look less like a defeat for the archbishop. Norreis also claimed that he received the office in return for unspecified services he rendered to Richard. There was no attempt at an election by the monks, a lack which went against <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>. During his tenure of office, his monks accused him of fornication, excessive drinking, gluttony, setting up favourites, starving the monks, and appropriating monastic property for his own use. A further offence was his habit of wearing secular clothing rather than the monastic habit prescribed by the Benedictine Rule. All these charges come from one of his monks, the historian <a href="Thomas%20of%20Marlborough">Thomas of Marlborough</a>, who wrote much of the history of Evesham known as the "<a href="Chronicon%20Abbatiae%20de%20Evesham">Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham</a>". Thomas's account of Norreis's rule is biased against the abbot and is a self-aggrandising account of how Thomas single-handedly triumphed over both his and his abbey's foes. Norreis did manage some good for the abbey, as it was while he was abbot that the <a href="crossing%20tower">crossing tower</a> of the monastic church was completed.

Early in his tenure Norreis appears to have been somewhat circumspect and did not greatly annoy his monks. The change appears to have happened around 1195, when the monks are first recorded as appealing to higher authority. Because Evesham had traditionally claimed to be exempt from episcopal oversight by the see of Worcester, in which it was located, the monks could only appeal to the <a href="papacy">papacy</a> or to a <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>. <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury after Baldwin, held a legateship for England until July 1195 and so the monks appealed to him. Walter forced Norreis to make some compromises with his subordinates, but the truce did not last long, and the monks once again complained of their treatment. They were visited by the new <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a> <a href="John%20of%20Coutances">John of Coutances</a> some time between 1196 and 1198, but Norreis succeeded in avoiding any severe sanctions by offering gifts to the bishop. The monks again appealed to Walter in about 1200, but between the archbishop's preoccupation with political affairs and Norreis's promises to reform, no solid changes occurred.

In 1202 the new Bishop of Worcester <a href="Mauger%20of%20Worcester">Mauger</a> attempted to investigate Norreis's conduct, but under the leadership of Thomas of Marlborough the monastic community refused to allow the bishop to visit, claiming that Evesham was exempt from <a href="Canonical%20visitation">episcopal visitation</a> and oversight. According to Thomas, Norreis offered to renounce the abbey's claim to exemption in return for money, but the bishop refused. Norreis then fled the monastery, while the monks continued to refuse the bishop and were excommunicated, a sentence that Norreis was spared. Between early September and mid-October the dispute was heard by three ecclesiastical tribunals; Mauger was supported by <a href="Eustace%20%28bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Eustace</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a>, and <a href="Giles%20de%20Braose">Giles de Braose</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>. The monks and Norreis then made common cause, each vowing to stand by the other in resisting Mauger. As well as these two cases, there was a dispute between the monks and the bishop over the ownership of some properties. The monks and Norreis then obtained the right for their case to be heard by <a href="papal%20judge-delegate">papal judge-delegate</a>s, but Mauger objected to the fact that the appointed judges were all <a href="Benedictine%20monk">Benedictine monk</a>s, and travelled to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> to appeal.

In 1203 Norreis, secure in his alliance with his own monks, once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit and that of his family and friends. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas, along with other monks, to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non-member of the community. Norreis protested to King <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a> and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis's exactions and abuse of his monks.

Norreis went to Rome in the company of Thomas of Marlborough shortly before 1205 to lay the abbey's case before the papacy. Thomas remained in Italy, but Norreis returned to England in the middle of 1205. While in Rome, Norreis and Thomas borrowed 400 <a href="mark%20%28money%29">marks</a> to finance the litigation at the <a href="papal%20curia">papal curia</a>. Norreis could not repay this sum and for a while was in danger of being imprisoned, but he managed to leave Rome without suffering the fate of one of his companions who was detained for the debt and died while imprisoned. When Norreis made it back to England, Mauger excommunicated the abbot in April 1205. The monks won a victory on the question of the abbey's exemption from episcopal visitation in 1206, but other elements of the quarrel remained unresolved, including that of the disputed churches. Later that year the monks became so annoyed by Norreis's abuse that they abandoned the abbey and did not return until they secured the abbot's confirmation of their rights.

With the question of the episcopal exemption decided in Evesham's favour, the alliance between Norreis and his monks dissolved. The monks again complained of their abbot's behaviour to the new papal legate, John of Sancta Maria. The legate ordered an investigation, the result being a written agreement between the two parties. Norreis gave gifts to the legate's nephew, refused to sign the agreement, and took revenge on his opponents by expelling Thomas of Marlborough and his allies from the monastery. Thirty monks followed Thomas into exile, and Norreis pursued them with soldiers who were defeated by the monks. A compromise was eventually reached, Norreis agreeing that the revenues of the abbey would be split with the monks, that officials of the abbey would be appointed by the abbot but with the advice and consent of the monks, and that the abbot would not admit or expel monks without taking the counsel of his monks nor dispose of the monastic property without the consent of his subordinates. Although the issue of the monks' support was temporarily solved, the issue of the disputed properties between Mauger and the monastery continued. Norreis appears to have been willing to compromise with the bishop, but the monks refused.

The dispute between Norreis and his monks dragged on for years. The <a href="interdict">interdict</a> of <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England%23Dispute%20with%20the%20Pope">1207–1213</a> caused further delays, but when it was lifted in 1213 the case against Norreis was finally heard. A <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a> visited the abbey and found that the monks were lacking in food, clothes, and other necessities. The <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> was not being performed according to the <a href="monastic%20rule">monastic rule</a> because the monks lacked the proper clothing. Charity to the poor had ceased, the monastic buildings were dilapidated, and the monks were forced to beg for their needs. The legate found that the abbot was living well, wearing non-monastic clothes, and enjoying the company of young women in his dwelling, while his monks suffered. Norreis was deposed from the abbacy by the papal legate in 1213.

On 27 November 1213 Norreis was appointed the prior of <a href="Penwortham%20Priory">Penwortham Priory</a>, a dependent priory of Evesham, partly to compensate him for the loss of the abbacy and partly to keep him from abandoning monastic life entirely. Norreis was deposed five months later owing to his continued bad morals and behaviour and again went to Rome in a bid to be restored to office. On this occasion he was unable to secure his reinstatement, but in 1218 or 1219 he was restored to Penwortham through the influence of the papal legate <a href="Pandulf%20Verraccio">Pandulf Verraccio</a>. Norreis died on 16 July or 19 July, but there is disagreement over the year of his death. The "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>" states that he died in 1223, but the editors of "Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, 940–1216" state he died in either 1224 or 1225. He was buried at Penwortham.

Thomas of Marlborough, who knew Norreis, wrote that he was "everywhere condemned as the manifest enemy of God". More modern writers echo the sentiment. <a href="John%20Moorman">John Moorman</a> described Norreis as a man "totally unsuited to the delicate and responsible task of ruling over a company of men and directing the affairs of a wealthy corporation". <a href="David%20Knowles%20%28scholar%29">David Knowles</a>, a historian of English monasticism, wrote that Norreis was "utterly unworthy to hold spiritual office of any kind", and that Baldwin's appointment of him as prior at Christ Church "must always remain a dark stain on the archbishop's reputation". Knowles also noted that he was "a man of great practical ability". Even Thomas of Marlborough noted that Norreis was energetic, entertaining, and full of enterprise.

Uncle David

Uncle David is a 2010 British <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a> film directed by <a href="David%20Hoyle%20%28performance%20artist%29">David Hoyle</a>, Gary Reich, and Mike Nicholls. It was produced by Reich and stars Hoyle, an English <a href="performance%20art">performance art</a>ist, in the titular role alongside English pornographic actor Ashley Ryder. Developed <a href="artist%20collective">collectively</a> under the banner of the Avant-Garde Alliance, it was filmed in October 2009. Created without a script, every scene was improvised and filmed in a single <a href="take">take</a>.

Set in a <a href="trailer%20park">caravan park</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="South%20East%20England">South East England</a>, a young man with a childlike mind named Ashley (Ryder) arrives to stay with his Uncle David (Hoyle). Escaping from his abusive mother, Ashley enters into a sexual relationship with his uncle who offers his insights into the world and the nature of reality. Eventually Ashley tells David that he wants to die, and David agrees to carry out the killing.

The film premiered on 25 March 2010 at the <a href="London%20Lesbian%20and%20Gay%20Film%20Festival">London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival</a> held in the <a href="BFI%20Southbank">BFI Southbank</a> in central London. Reviews were mixed, but the film won several awards at international film festivals. It was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> by <a href="Peccadillo%20Pictures">Peccadillo Pictures</a> in 2011.

Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder) – a young man with a childlike mentality – arrives at the <a href="Mobile%20home">caravan home</a> of his Uncle David (<a href="David%20Hoyle%20%28performance%20artist%29">David Hoyle</a>) on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a>. Ashley confides in his uncle that his mother has been physically abusing him by stubbing cigarettes out on his hand. David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss before going to bed together. The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy <a href="nuclear%20family">nuclear family</a>. Going to a local café and then a park bench, David continues to explain his anti-establishment opinions about society. Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another.

The pair snort <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> before playing in the local entertainment arcade. Returning to the caravan, they engage in <a href="Erotic%20asphyxiation">sexual strangulation</a> and <a href="anal%20sex">anal sex</a>. Putting on make-up, they then drink wine and dance to a remix of the <a href="Muse%20%28band%29">Muse</a> song "<a href="Uprising%20%28song%29">Uprising</a>", while same-sex pornography starring Ashley plays on the television set. While Ashley puts on <a href="Drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a>, David encourages him to kill himself, telling him that he is "too nice for this Earth" and needs to escape the world's problems.

The next morning, Ashley plays on the beach and builds <a href="sand%20castles">sand castles</a>. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, demanding to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an <a href="altered%20state%20of%20consciousness">altered state of consciousness</a>, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a>. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled "Is Britain Great?". He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.

According to "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Hoyle became "something of a legend" on the British cabaret circuit during the 1990s, initially under the alter-ego of "The Divine David". The Divine David was an "anti-<a href="drag%20queen">drag queen</a>" who combined "lacerating social commentary" with "breathtaking instances of self-recrimination and even self-harm." Taking this character to television, Hoyle produced two shows for <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>, "The Divine David Presents" (1999) and "The Divine David Heals" (2000), before killing off the character at a farewell show at <a href="Streatham%20Ice%20Arena">Streatham Ice Arena</a>, south London, titled "The Divine David on Ice" (2000). Independently, Hoyle appeared in the film "<a href="Velvet%20Goldmine">Velvet Goldmine</a>" (1998) and the television series "<a href="Nathan%20Barley">Nathan Barley</a>" (2005).

Ryder had hoped to be a fashion designer, undertaking a course at <a href="Central%20Saint%20Martins">Central Saint Martins</a> which he did not complete; from there he worked in retail, first for Prowler and then for the designer <a href="Vivienne%20Westwood">Vivienne Westwood</a>. Subsequently, appearing in gay pornography as a <a href="twink%20%28gay%20slang%29">twink</a> <a href="Top%2C%20bottom%20and%20versatile">bottom</a> for production companies like <a href="Eurocreme">Eurocreme</a> and UK Naked Men, he starred in such films as "Drunk on Spunk" and "Stretch that Hole", winning numerous awards for his work. By the time he made "Uncle David", he was also running his own weekly gay wrestling night in London.

Hoyle and Ryder met at a <a href="performance%20art">performance art</a> event, after which the former asked Ryder if he would appear in one of his stage shows. Ryder was busy at the time, but agreed to the request several years later. Staged at the <a href="Royal%20Vauxhall%20Tavern">Royal Vauxhall Tavern</a> (RVT), a <a href="gay%20bar">gay bar</a> in <a href="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</a>, South London, the duo constructed a piece in which Ryder played the role of Hoyle's nephew in an "<a href="ad-lib">ad-lib</a>" performance. Hoyle played a department store <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a> while Ryder portrayed a misbehaving nine-year-old. The performance ended in Hoyle's Santa character pulling Christmas <a href="tinsel">tinsel</a> from the child's anus before strangling him.

Reich – who had known Hoyle since the late 1990s – was in the audience, and enjoyed the chemistry between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over the course of a day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into "Uncle David". In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.

"Uncle David" was filmed over five days in October 2009 on the Isle of Sheppey, a location chosen for its proximity to London. Hoyle commented that the profusion of barbed wire fences there made him wonder if they were "keeping people out or keeping people in?". Reich said that he had been "obsessed" with Sheppey, a place he had considered "a truly Godforsaken wasteland" since working on a television show there ten years previously. He remarked that the "trailer trash setting" of the film was influenced by <a href="Harmony%20Korine">Harmony Korine</a>'s "<a href="Gummo">Gummo</a>" (1997) and <a href="John%20Waters%20%28director%20born%201946%29">John Waters</a>' "<a href="Female%20Trouble">Female Trouble</a>" (1974). He also said that the filming budget of under £1000 was a homage to "the spirit of John Waters." All the extras featured in the film were real inhabitants of Sheppey, and to film a scene in a local cafe, they walked in and asked the proprietors if they could shoot there. Although they had planned to tell any enquirers who approached them that they were shooting a <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>, during the shoot none of the locals expressed any interest in the crew's activities.
The caravan park was largely empty at the time, and closed for winter several days after filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he felt that it was "quite hectic but [had] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder remained in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." During filming, he contracted <a href="swine%20flu">swine flu</a>, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to <a href="adrenaline">adrenaline</a>. He noted that "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that "When I was 14, I had – let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if ["Uncle David"] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, for the rest of your life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition."

The footage was captured on two <a href="Sony%20HVR-Z1%23Sony%20HVR-Z1">Sony HVR-Z1</a> camcorders. Costumes had been purchased at an <a href="Oxfam">Oxfam</a> <a href="charity%20shop">charity shop</a> in <a href="Dalston">Dalston</a>, <a href="East%20London">East London</a>, while a wig worn by Ashley in one scene was purchased from a Dalston wig store. Knowing that he would appear nude in several scenes, Ryder went to the gym regularly in the weeks proceeding filming to gain greater muscle tone. He decided to include footage from one of his pornographic videos in "Uncle David", inspired to do so after learning that serial killers <a href="Fred%20West">Fred</a> and <a href="Rosemary%20West">Rosemary West</a> screened pornography throughout the day in their home.

The composer <a href="Richard%20Thomas%20%28musician%29">Richard Thomas</a>, co-creator of the controversial "", agreed to produce a musical score for the film, having long been a fan of Hoyle's work. After the cast and crew listened to a Muse album while driving between locations, they decided to include the band's work as they felt it was "empowering". They had also planned to include a song by <a href="Antony%20and%20the%20Johnsons">Antony and the Johnsons</a> in the film, but this was scrapped, to be replaced by a track by <a href="Boy%20George">Boy George</a>. After the film was screened for Boy George, the first person outside the Avant-Garde Alliance to see it, he commented "well it ain't "<a href="The%20Sound%20of%20Music">The Sound of Music</a>"".

"Uncle David" premiered on 25 March 2010 at the <a href="London%20Lesbian%20and%20Gay%20Film%20Festival">London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival</a> held in the <a href="BFI%20Southbank">BFI Southbank</a> in central London. Attending the screening was Steve Marmion, the boss of <a href="Soho%20Theatre">Soho Theatre</a>, who suggested to Reich and Hoyle that they produce a theatrical adaptation of the film. They initially showed an interest in the project; Reich commented that "It was a very mischievous concept, doing an upbeat, life-affirming song-and-dance musical with that storyline and subject matter." However, the theatrical adaptation never surfaced, something Thomas attributed to the difficulty in obtaining funding for a musical on such a "dark subject." Instead, Hoyle and Thomas teamed up to produce "Merrie Hell", an "alternative Christmas celebration" that appeared at the Soho Theatre in December 2012. A two-man cabaret that differed every night, it featured Thomas on a piano, accompanying Hoyle's rendition of various songs about Christmas and Britain's societal problems; Thomas described it as "David Hoyle at Christmas – the Musical". One of the songs featured in "Merrie Hell", "It's Alright to Want to Die", carried a pro-suicide theme influenced by "Uncle David".

In December 2011, "Uncle David" was released as a <a href="DVD%20region%20code">Region Free</a> DVD by the company <a href="Peccadillo%20Pictures">Peccadillo Pictures</a>, a UK based film distributor of art house, gay and lesbian, independent and world cinema. The release contained several extras, including the three preparatory shorts detailing the relationship between the characters of Ashley and Uncle David and a cast commentary track voiced by Hoyle, Ryder, Reich and Nicholls. Reviewing the DVD release for the "Sex Gore Mutants" website, Stuart Willis noted that the disc contained periods of "murkiness or softness in the picture" and a few "(infrequent) instances of muffling", all of which he put down to the original production values of the film. British gay magazine "<a href="Attitude%20%28magazine%29">Attitude</a>" celebrated the DVD's release with a competition to win one of three copies; they described the film as "a bit surreal, but totally amazing."

The film received a number of awards at international film festivals. At the 2010 <a href="Ch%C3%A9ries-Ch%C3%A9ris">Paris International LGBT Film Festival</a> it won the best film award and Hoyle and Ryder shared the best actor award. It also won best film at the 2011 Berlin Porn Film Festival, and best film at the 2011 <a href="Erotic%20Awards">Erotic Awards</a>. Reich expressed surprise at the Erotic Award, because he did not consider the film to be a work of erotica, but discovered that they'd won because they had explored "an extreme fetish that to be honest we'd not actually heard of nor knew we were exploring."

Reviews of "Uncle David" were mixed. Writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Ben Walters noted that "suspense and dread accumulate as the low-key naturalism and the characters' obvious affection for one another play off against the enormity of what looms ahead." Comparing "Uncle David" to Hoyle's earlier stage work, he felt that the two were "consistent", but that in the film Hoyle abandoned the "fireworks of his performance persona", opting for a "controlled, beguiling style". He believed that Ryder's familiarity with being filmed meant that he carried a "disarmingly ingenuous presence, by turns determined and naive." Walters opined that the film's "menacing" use of British seaside locations was similar to that in "<a href="Brighton%20Rock%20%281947%20film%29">Brighton Rock</a>" and "<a href="London%20to%20Brighton">London to Brighton</a>", while he also drew comparisons to "<a href="Badlands%20%28film%29">Badlands</a>", "<a href="Bonnie%20and%20Clyde%20%28film%29">Bonnie and Clyde</a>" and "<a href="The%20Talented%20Mr.%20Ripley%20%28film%29">The Talented Mr. Ripley</a>", in that in all of them, the viewers' sympathy for the characters eclipses moral judgement of their actions. Walters would follow this with another review published in "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>", in which he awarded the film five stars out of five.

"Not to everyone's taste, granted, ["Uncle David"] is nevertheless an original and disturbing take on modern love stories" was the view of Stuart Willis writing for the "Sex-Gore-Mutants" website. Believing that the film was a "pleasant surprise", he praised the improvised nature of the work, believing that it created believable scenes and allowed the viewer to get to know the characters "almost without realising." He considered the acting to be very good, and particularly praised Hoyle's ability to portray a paedophile grooming a young man in a way that was both "pathetic and truly sinister all at once". Rather than falling into "tasteless exploitation", Willis thought that the film was saved by a lack of sensationalism. Praising the exterior scenes as "beautifully atmospheric" and the music as "fitting the laconic mood and sense of ill-foreboding well", he considered the film to be a good example of low-key filmmaking, akin to that produced in Britain during the early 1980s.

Other reviewers were far more critical. Writing for the "So So Gay" website, Damien Ryan gave "Uncle David" a rating of 0.5 out of 5, describing it as "terrible". Believing that the film simply intended to shock viewers with its taboo subject matter, he felt offended by the story's "sheer inelegance". Opining that it reminded him of "the very worst attempt of a first-year film student", he questioned the description of "Uncle David" as a "black comedy", arguing that it wasn't at all funny, instead labelling it "the most vapid, transparent attempt at shock this side of a <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a> performance." Criticising the acting, he said that Ryder "shouldn't quit his porn day job any time soon" and that Hoyle's character was simply a "marriage of wannabe <a href="Holden%20Caulfield">Holden Caulfield</a>-style outsider and mincing paedophile."

Cleaver Patterson was similarly critical in his review on the "Cine-Vue" website, awarding the film one out of five stars. He questioned the purpose of the film, arguing that it will only serve to alienate the gay population by portraying them as "sad, perverted and ultimately lonely individuals." More positively, he praised the appearance of the film with its "muted colours of the shingle beaches and piercing blue skies".

God of War: Ascension

God of War: Ascension is a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> video game developed by <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica Studio</a> and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> (SCE). The game was first released on March 12, 2013, for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> (PS3) console. It is the seventh installment in the <a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">"God of War" series</a> and <a href="prequel">prequel</a> to the entire series. Loosely based on <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the game is set in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a>, the former servant of the God of War <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. In response to this tragedy, Kratos renounced Ares, breaking his blood oath to the god. Kratos was therefore imprisoned and tortured by the three <a href="Erinyes">Furies</a>, guardians of honor and enforcers of punishment. Helped by the oath keeper <a href="Horkos">Orkos</a>, Kratos escapes his imprisonment and confronts the Furies to be completely free of his bond to Ares.

The gameplay is similar to previous installments, focusing on <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based</a> combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and other weapons acquired by the new World Weapons <a href="Game%20mechanics">mechanic</a>. It continues the use of <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a>s and adds a new, promptless, free-form system. Four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability can be used as alternative combat options, and the game features <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzles</a> and <a href="platform%20game">platforming</a> elements. "Ascension" is the only installment in the series to include <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a>, which is <a href="Online%20game">online-only</a> and features modes for both <a href="Player%20versus%20player">competitive</a> and <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative</a> play. It also features a redesigned combat system, new gameplay mechanics, and <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>. From October 2012 to March 2013, a <a href="Social%20network%20game">social experience</a> was available online in the form of a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> titled "<a href="%23Rise%20of%20the%20Warrior">Rise of the Warrior</a>", a prequel story that tied into the game's single-player and multiplayer modes.

"God of War: Ascension" received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its fundamental gameplay and spectacle as true to the series, although the story was generally deemed to be less compelling than previous installments. The game's multiplayer element received mixed responses: although reviewers found that the gameplay translated well into the multiplayer element, they criticized the balance and depth of combat. "Ascension" did not perform as well as its predecessors in terms of sales and awards, but it did receive several nominations, including the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> Videogame Awards's "Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing" and the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> award for "Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design".

In both of "God of War: Ascension"s <a href="single-player%20video%20game">single-player</a> and <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> elements, it is primarily a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> video game viewed from a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Fixed">fixed camera</a> perspective. Some scenes in the single-player campaign feature a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> camera view. In single-player mode, the player controls the character <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a> in <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based combat</a>, <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle games</a>. The enemies are an assortment of creatures, most of whom are drawn from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, including <a href="cyclops">cyclopes</a>, <a href="cerberus">cerberus</a>es, <a href="empusa">empusa</a>s, <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">Siren</a>s, <a href="Gorgons">Gorgons</a>, <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s, <a href="harpies">harpies</a>, and <a href="centaurs">centaurs</a>. Other monsters were created specifically for the game, such as the juggernauts, wraiths, and <a href="manticore">manticore</a>s. Many of the monsters also appear in the multiplayer mode. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and slide down walls to proceed through sections of the game. The game features a variety of puzzles, ranging from simple to complex.

Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos, a pair of blades attached to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons <a href="Game%20mechanics">mechanic</a> called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes as part of the new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can <a href="tether">tether</a> enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.

Four <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">magical</a> disciplines are acquired, including the Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, depending on the magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage <a href="Superpower%20%28ability%29">ability</a> called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking for an extended period of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.

Three relics, the Amulet of Uroborus (Life Cycle mechanic), the Oath Stone of Orkos, and the Eyes of Truth, are acquired and needed for game progression. The Amulet of Uroborus allows Kratos to manipulate time by decaying or healing an object; examples include reconstructing broken pathways and using it during puzzle-solving. Construction can be paused or reversed if needed. The amulet can also be used against enemies to briefly slow their movements. The Oath Stone of Orkos gives Kratos the ability to create a "shadow" duplicate of himself that can depress plates, hold levers, or attack enemies. The Eyes of Truth remove illusions created by the Furies and cast a blinding light on enemies. As well as the <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a> (QTE) mechanic featured in the previous games, a new, promptless, free-form system allows players to choose when to attack or dodge based on the enemy's actions. When certain foes, such as a cyclops or a juggernaut, have been sufficiently weakened, the player may jump on their back and briefly force them to attack other foes.

Other extra features include ten artifacts hidden in the game world that provide more abilities during <a href="New%20Game%20Plus">New Game Plus</a>, such as unlimited magic. This mode also allows players to change Kratos' costume, but <a href="PlayStation%20Network%23Trophies">trophies</a> are disabled. A new feature absent from previous installments is "Chapter Select", which allows players to select and replay previously completed levels. Unlike previous installments, in which behind-the-scenes videos are unlocked after completing the game, these videos are already available from the main menu.

"God of War: Ascension" is the only installment in the series to offer a multiplayer feature, which is <a href="Online%20game">online-only</a>, and up to eight players can take part. The main objective for players is to take control of a map to earn rewards from the gods. Before entering multiplayer battles, each player is introduced to a warrior, who, like Kratos, is an oath-breaker and is imprisoned in the Prison of the Damned—the warrior's backstory is explored in "<a href="%23Rise%20of%20the%20Warrior">Rise of the Warrior</a>". The player takes control of the warrior and aligns with one of the four deities: Ares, Hades, Zeus, or Poseidon. Each god offers a unique combat play-style and in-battle abilities. The attack style of the god with whom the player aligns is critical to their warrior's path. Players who ally with Ares are brute force experts with an up-close focus, although they are weak defensively, specifically to long range magical attacks. Players who ally with Zeus are magical experts with a focus on space control, although they are balanced by their lack of melee strength. Players who ally with Poseidon are supports with a focus on team synergy and self-sustenance; his synergistic powers can be replaced by more self-defense abilities if desired, although never as much as the other 3 gods. Players who ally with Hades are versatile, unlike the other 3, featuring other unique mechanics such as lifesteal, stealth and curses, making them excellent at controlling the flow of combat, although they can also choose to specialize in certain roles with certain armors or weaponry. Players can create up to three more warriors and have a champion representing each god.

Players can unlock special magic abilities, new and upgraded armors, weapons, relics, and other treasures as they earn experience points (XP) to level-up their warrior. Players may also complete "Labors", which are challenges from the gods that rewards armor and weapons. Throughout multiplayer matches, players receive <a href="Status%20effect%23Buffs%20and%20debuffs">buffs and debuffs</a>, and there is a color-coding system, called flashes, where a player's character will flash a certain color indicating a special property, such as vulnerability or invulnerability. A prestige feature called "Ascension", added in the June 10, 2013 <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29%23Video%20games">update</a>, allows players to reset their allegiance progression when they reach Level 40, and receive in-game currency for "Godly" armors and weapons—the "most valuable and powerful items in the game". They are classified as a Hero the first time they ascend and then a Demigod the second time and keep that title from then on.

There are five multiplayer modes: Team Favor of the Gods, Match of Champions, Trial of the Gods, <a href="Capture%20the%20Flag">Capture the Flag</a>, and Bout of Honor. Team matches randomly assign players to compete on either the <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n or <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> team. The "signature" multiplayer mode is Team Favor of the Gods, in which two teams of two-to-four players try to win by accumulating a target quantity of points. Points, known as Favor, are earned by killing and other methods. When players are not on the offensive, they may help their team earn points by capturing altars, collecting red orbs from chests, and setting traps for opposing players. The non-team version, Match of Champions, is a four-to-eight-player <a href="deathmatch">deathmatch</a> with a similar goal to Team Favor of the Gods. Trial of the Gods is a two-player, cooperative (co-op), <a href="Time%20attack%23Video%20games">time-trial</a> mode in which the duo faces five waves of mythological monsters concluding with a boss fight. A single-player version is also available. In Capture the Flag, two teams of four players battle to capture the opposing team's flag and return it to their base until a target number of flags have been obtained. In Bout of Honor, added in the July 11, 2013 update, players test their skills in a best-of-seven-rounds one-on-one fight.

All but two of the fifteen multiplayer maps are based on locations explored throughout the "God of War" series, with eight of those based on locations explored in "Ascension"; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">God of War</a>", Bog of the Forgotten is from "<a href="God%20of%20War%20II">God of War II</a>", and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from "<a href="God%20of%20War%20III">God of War III</a>". The two original maps are the Coliseum of <a href="Persia">Persia</a> and the Walls of <a href="Troy">Troy</a> (which features the <a href="Trojan%20Horse">Trojan Horse</a>). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Olympus</a> will grant bonus points for that team.

As with previous games, "God of War: Ascension" is set in an alternate version of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> populated by the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian Gods</a>, <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>, and other beings from Greek mythology. Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family, and ten years before the original "God of War" (2005). The next game chronologically would be "Chains of Olympus" (2008), which takes place some time between "Ascension" and "God of War" (2005). The game's narrative takes place over four weeks; it shifts between the present (the fourth week) and past (the preceding three weeks), while the player controls Kratos in both. Several locations, including the Prison of the Damned and some real-world locations—including the village <a href="Kirra%2C%20Phocis">Kirra</a>, the city <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>, and the island <a href="Delos">Delos</a>—are explored in the game.

The Prison of the Damned is the Furies' massive prison to house all oath-breakers. Kirra is an abandoned village that lost its water supply after its <a href="water%20wheel">water wheel</a> and <a href="Aqueduct%20%28bridge%29">aqueduct</a> were destroyed. Other than monsters, the only life is in its harbor, where the tamed <a href="Laestrygonian">Harbor Master</a> guides vessels in and out of the port. Delphi is located in the snowy mountains north of Kirra and features the Tower of Delphi. After activating three massive, mechanical pythons, the Tower allows access to the Temple of Delphi, home of the Oracle. Delos features a Titan-sized statue of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, constructed by the inventor <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> to honor the god.

The game's protagonist is Kratos (voiced by <a href="Terrence%20C.%20Carson">Terrence C. Carson</a>), a Spartan warrior who broke his blood oath to the god <a href="Ares">Ares</a> after being tricked into killing his family by his former master. The main antagonists are the three <a href="Erinyes">Furies</a>: <a href="Megaera">Megaera</a> (<a href="Nika%20Futterman">Nika Futterman</a>), <a href="Tisiphone">Tisiphone</a> (<a href="Debi%20Mae%20West">Debi Mae West</a>), and the Fury Queen, <a href="Alecto">Alecto</a> (<a href="Jennifer%20Hale">Jennifer Hale</a>). The Furies are the guardians of honor and the bane of traitors, who punish those they deem guilty. They were spawned from the eons-long war between the <a href="Greek%20primordial%20deities">Primordials</a>, the beings who created the Earth. Other characters include the oath keeper <a href="Horkos">Orkos</a> (<a href="Troy%20Baker">Troy Baker</a>), the son of Ares and Alecto, who was disowned by the god as he was not the perfect warrior that Ares sought; <a href="Pythia">Aletheia</a> (<a href="Adrienne%20Barbeau">Adrienne Barbeau</a>), the Oracle of Delphi with prophetic sight; the corrupted Prophet <a href="Castor%20and%20Pollux">Castor</a> (David W. Collins) and his conjoined twin <a href="Castor%20and%20Pollux">Pollux</a> (Brad Grusnick), who usurped the oracle, deciding who can consult her; and the Scribe of Hecatonchires (<a href="Robin%20Atkin%20Downes">Robin Atkin Downes</a>), the first mortal imprisoned by the Furies who has been keeping records to maintain his sanity. Kratos' wife Lysandra (Jennifer Hale) and his daughter Calliope appear in an illusion created by Alecto, and the King of Sparta (<a href="Crispin%20Freeman">Crispin Freeman</a>) and the Village Oracle (<a href="Susan%20Blakeslee">Susan Blakeslee</a>) appear in an illusion created by Tisiphone with the help of her <a href="Familiar%20spirit">familiar</a>, <a href="Daemon%20%28classical%20mythology%29">Daemon</a>.

In the game's multiplayer mode, <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> (<a href="Corey%20Burton">Corey Burton</a>), the King of the Olympian Gods, Ares (<a href="Steven%20Blum">Steven Blum</a>), the God of War, <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> (<a href="Gideon%20Emery">Gideon Emery</a>), the God of the Sea, and <a href="Hades">Hades</a> (<a href="Fred%20Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>), the God of the <a href="Greek%20underworld">Underworld</a>, appear as statues at the Rotunda of Olympus where the player selects one to align to, after which the chosen god will communicate with the player during gameplay. Castor and Pollux, the demigod <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> (<a href="Kevin%20Sorbo">Kevin Sorbo</a>), the Titan cyclops <a href="Polyphemus">Polyphemus</a>, the Gorgon <a href="Stheno">Stheno</a>, and the giant scorpion <a href="Scorpius%23Mythology">Skorpius</a> also appear in the multiplayer as <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">bosses</a> and/or environmental obstacles.

The game begins with Kratos, who is imprisoned, chained, and tormented by the Furies for breaking his blood oath to Ares. The Fury Megaera tortures Kratos, but he manages to break free. Chasing her through the prison, he discovers that the prison itself is <a href="Hekatonkheires">Aegaeon the Hecatonchires</a>, the first traitor of the Furies who had broken a blood oath to Zeus; he was turned into the Prison of the Damned as punishment. Overcoming an illusion created by the Fury Tisiphone and her familiar Daemon, Kratos finds and kills Megaera, retrieving the Amulet of <a href="Uroborus">Uroborus</a>, which the Furies had confiscated from him when he was imprisoned.

The narrative shifts to three weeks before Kratos' imprisonment. Confronted by Orkos in the Village of Kirra, Kratos is advised that the visions he has been experiencing are mind tricks created by the Furies, and instructs him to find the Oracle of Delphi. Upon arrival at the Temple of Delphi, he overcomes Castor and Pollux, who tried to kill the Oracle. In her dying breath, the Oracle instructs Kratos to travel to Delos to retrieve the Eyes of Truth. Taking the Amulet of Uroborus from the now-dead Castor and Pollux, Kratos travels to Kirra's harbor, where he again encounters Orkos. The oath keeper reveals that Ares wanted a perfect warrior to help him overthrow Zeus, so Ares <a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29%23Plot">helped Kratos against the barbarians</a> to make him into a perfect warrior. Orkos became the oath keeper and did not question the Furies until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his own family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos takes a ship to Delos.

A week later, Kratos arrives at the island of Delos and explores the ruined statue of Apollo. He is attacked by all three Furies and is eventually captured. Orkos appears and frees Kratos, transporting him to another location. Orkos gives Kratos his Oath Stone and reveals that he and Aletheia tried to warn Zeus of Ares' and the Furies' plan. In retaliation, they took the Oracle's eyes, the objects Kratos seeks. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to restore the statue and retrieve the eyes. On completing the Trials of Archimedes, Kratos is ambushed and captured by the Furies, who confiscate all of his items.

Back in the present time, Tisiphone and Daemon cast another illusion to deceive Kratos, who overcomes it and retrieves the Oath Stone of Orkos. He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home to his wife and daughter: another illusion, this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves the eyes, and Alecto transforms into a <a href="Charybdis">giant sea monster</a>. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.

Kratos returns to Sparta, where he is met by Orkos. He praises Kratos' victory over the Furies, but reveals that Kratos will not be free from Ares' bond unless he kills Orkos. He begs Kratos to give him an honorable death, which will free them both from Ares. Kratos initially refuses but Orkos' continuing pleas ultimately force Kratos to kill him. Afterward, Kratos experiences the first of many nightmares—previously masked by his bond—and discovers his path to redemption through continual service to Olympus. Kratos burns down his house with the corpse of Orkos inside and leaves, beginning his path towards becoming the champion of the gods.

In January 2010, <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica</a>'s studio director John Hight told video-gaming blog <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> that "while "God of War III" will conclude the trilogy, it won't spell the end of the franchise" and said "We're going to be really careful about what we do next." From April 2011 until April 2012, several sources claimed that a fourth main entry would release sometime in 2012 and would feature an online component. On April 12, 2012, Sony released a teaser image on its official PlayStation <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page, which was followed by the game's announcement on April 19, though <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a> <a href="news%20leak">leaked</a> the announcement the day before. The trailer announced Todd Papy, who had worked as a designer on "God of War" and "God of War II" and as Design Director on "God of War III", as Game Director. <a href="David%20Jaffe">David Jaffe</a> confirmed that "God of War III" Game Director <a href="Stig%20Asmussen">Stig Asmussen</a> did not return to direct this game because he was working on another project at Santa Monica. The announcement trailer was narrated by <a href="Linda%20Hunt">Linda Hunt</a>; it refers to a time before Kratos became the Ghost of Sparta and was not "bound in blood". The announcement officially confirmed that the game's title would be "God of War: Ascension". Papy said the game was not titled "<a href="God%20of%20War%20IV">God of War IV</a>" to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy. The name was chosen because it complements the story and the additional multiplayer component; according to Papy, in this mode, players are "basically ascending from an unknown hero to a god".<ref name="4/30"></ref>

The game features a retooled "God of War III" engine, enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players. Papy said to allow customization, Kratos and other known gods would not be included as playable characters in the multiplayer modes because the developers did not want "red Kratos, blue Kratos, yellow Kratos", and selecting gods would lock players into established roles. This decision was made "to balance the game when players are pitted against each other". Papy also said there would be no female characters because each character in the multiplayer mode is based on Kratos' animation model. The first demonstration of the game's multiplayer element featured the Team Favor of the Gods mode running on the map Desert of Lost Souls, which features the Titan cyclops Polyphemus. Multiplayer had been discussed for past games, but had never been implemented as previous game directors felt that "God of War" was a single-player-only experience; in "Chains of Olympus"s case, it was cut due to time constraints during development. For "Ascension", the development team made the decision to invest in multiplayer after a simple version, tested using two Kratoses, turned out to be "a lot of fun" for the game testers.

The development team faced challenges in adding multiplayer to an established single-player franchise. Other established franchises had been criticized for sub-par multiplayer implementations, so Santa Monica felt they had to prove to critics that their multiplayer mode would not be "tacked on". Since multiplayer was new to the team, new staff were hired who specialized in multiplayer, engineering, and design, but Santa Monica did not realize the amount of work required for the experience they had envisioned. Development was delayed because multiplayer mode required several rewrites. The player navigation code had to be changed for online play, which was initially designed for co-op; the team eventually decided this was unsatisfactory, and the changed approach cost significant development time. <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game%23Single-system">Local co-op</a> was also explored, but the team decided to keep multiplayer online-only. The team finally "found the heart of [the] final multiplayer game" shortly before the first press show. Development focus switched back and forth between single-player and multiplayer; single-player received less attention while the team were preparing multiplayer for the first press announcement, but when single-player mode was reemphasized prior to its public debut, multiplayer mode suffered.

David Jaffe, creator and Game Director of the original "God of War", spoke with "NowGamer" prior to the first press announcement in late April. He said that if he had worked on "Ascension", he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and "look to the "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">Zelda</a>" structure as a jumping off point". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added "I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with <a href="IGN">IGN</a> about the multiplayer element: "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, "If it turns out to be the case that the single player is watered down because of [multiplayer], then I think they have some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are."

At Sony's <a href="E3%202012">2012</a> <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) press conference, the North American release date was confirmed as March 12, 2013. A single-player demo was shown, revealing new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. An encounter with the sea monster <a href="Charybdis">Charybdis</a> was included in the demo, but this sequence was cut from the final game. Charybdis was recast as the creature that Alecto transforms into during the final fight of the game. The same day, Papy confirmed on <a href="PlayStation.Blog">PlayStation.Blog</a> that a collector's edition of the game would be released. He said "Ascension" was being developed to feature <a href="Stereoscopy">stereoscopic 3D</a>,<ref name="06/04"></ref> but it was ultimately cut. At <a href="gamescom%202012">gamescom 2012</a>, new multiplayer footage was shown, followed by the announcement of a multiplayer <a href="Betaware">beta</a>.
At the 2012 <a href="Penny%20Arcade%20Expo">Penny Arcade Expo</a> (PAX), Game Director Todd Papy, Lead Game Designer Mark Simon, Principal Character Artist Patrick Murphy, and writer of the "God of War" series <a href="Marianne%20Krawczyk">Marianne Krawczyk</a>, hosted the first "God of War" panel, discussing the origins of "Ascension", and provided an overview of the evolution of Kratos. The Fury Megaera was revealed, and Mark Simon discussed the new combat system. Papy said he had considered using the goddess <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> as a playable female character, which would have offered the player alternative combat options. Artemis would have been depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness. Artemis was ultimately cut from the game, but Papy said he would like to explore the possibility of using other gods in the future.

In the developmental transition from "God of War III" to "Ascension", one of the graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that the limits of the "God of War III" engine restricted artist creativity, so they "tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance." For example, the number of <a href="UV%20mapping">UV</a> sets was increased to three per mesh. For a complex character model like Kratos, "independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him, each wrapping around the head, torso and limbs - all of which form an editable 'UV set' when laid out flat." Allowing more UV sets also made it possible to have a more natural look to the environment. "Ascension" was not as dramatic an advance in graphics over its predecessor as "God of War III" had been: "From a graphics 'technical' perspective, to a large degree "God of War: Ascension" was more refinement on the graphics front" said another graphics engineer, Ben Diamand, who focused on optimization during "Ascension"s development. The development team also added <a href="dynamic%20lighting">dynamic lighting</a>, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved from "God of War III": "the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles" said Perthuis.

Terrence C. Carson, Linda Hunt, Corey Burton, Gideon Emery, Steven Blum, and Kevin Sorbo reprised their roles as Kratos, the narrator, Zeus, Poseidon, Ares, and Hercules, respectively. Jennifer Hale, who voiced two characters in the , voiced the Fury Alecto and Kratos' wife, Lysandra, who was previously voiced by <a href="Gwendoline%20Yeo">Gwendoline Yeo</a>. Debi Mae West, Adrienne Barbeau, and Crispin Freeman, who had each done voice work on previous installments, voiced the characters Tisiphone, Aletheia, and the King of Sparta. Troy Baker voiced the oath keeper Orkos and is the announcer in the multiplayer mode. Series veteran Fred Tatasciore assumed the role of Hades, who was previously voiced by <a href="Clancy%20Brown">Clancy Brown</a>. Susan Blakeslee reprised her role as the Village Oracle, who makes a cameo appearance as an illusion created by Tisiphone. Unlike previous games in which <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> and <a href="voice%20over">voice recording</a> were done separately, "Ascension" used "voice-over motion capture"; voice recording and motion capture were done at the same time, which allowed the voice actors to act out their characters' scenes together. The voice-over motion capture was done at House of Moves in <a href="Culver%20City%2C%20California">Culver City, California</a>.

A global multiplayer beta was announced at gamescom 2012. The beta included features that had not been previously revealed. Players who participated in the "Rise of the Warrior" social challenge on GodofWar.com received early access to the beta in December 2012. Players from <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment%20Europe">SCE Europe</a> also received an opportunity to access the beta early. The beta became available for <a href="PlayStation%20Network%23PlayStation%20Plus">PlayStation Plus</a> subscribers on January 8, 2013. On January 19, Santa Monica allowed all <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> users in North and South America access to the beta via a redeemable voucher. The beta test ended at midnight <a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">Pacific time</a> on January 21. In the beta, players could choose to align themselves with Ares or Zeus. It featured the eight-player Desert of Lost Souls map and the four-player Forum of Hercules map. The beta included the Desert of Lost Souls map in the modes Team Favor of the Gods and Capture the Flag, and the Forum of Hercules map in the mode Favor of the Gods, renamed Match of Champions in final release. All participants of the beta received the Champion's Armor and Blade for their multiplayer character when the game launched.

According to Santa Monica's senior producer Whitney Wade and director of internal development Chacko Sonny, the beta made the team look at the game as an "evolving service". The beta allowed the developers to make sure that the game design would meet with the approval of existing fans of the series, and that the system could cope with a high volume of players. Wade and Sonny said the testing went as expected, "revealing successive layers of issues that we would address, deploy fixes for, and then monitor in a live environment." The most important change from the beta, they said, was their planning in how to support the game post-launch. The team designed a process that allowed them to "quickly iterate on fixes, deploy them through infrastructure (testing, certification, patching), and coordinate with internal technology partners within Sony." They also developed a system to allow them to monitor, log, and interpret any changes added, and the beta test gave insight on how to prioritize key features.

At E3 2012, a single-player demo was shown, featuring new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. The demo revealed a redesigned quick time event mini-game, which replaced some button prompts with a new, prompt-less, free-form system. It featured the World Weapons mechanic and Kratos was shown to be capable of swinging opponents through the air while simultaneously attacking. Other new features included the Fire of Ares magic and the "Life Cycle" mechanic. Several new enemies, such as the juggernaut and the sea beast Charybdis, were also featured, though the latter was cut from the final game. The E3 2012 single-player demo was included with early copies of the "Director's Cut" Blu-ray edition and Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack versions of the film, "<a href="Total%20Recall%20%282012%20film%29">Total Recall</a>", which were released on December 18, 2012. On February 26, 2013, a new single-player demo titled the Prison of the Damned was released on the <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a> to download. Participants of the "Rise of the Warrior" social challenge who were on the Spartan team received access to the demo on February 20. The demo comprises the first 30-minutes of the single-player mode.

"God of War: Ascension" was released in North America on March 12, 2013, in mainland Europe and <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s on March 13, in Australia and New Zealand on March 14, and in the UK and Ireland on March 15. In the US, it sold 570,000 units in the first month of its release not including bundled sales, making it the fourth-best-selling game of March 2013. The game's sales were significantly lower than "God of War III"s first month sales, which were 1.1 million units. On October 15, 2013, "God of War: Ascension" was released as a <a href="Digital%20distribution">digital download</a> on the PlayStation Store in North America. The digital version was released in Europe and Australia on October 23, and in Japan and Asia on October 31. On September 24, 2014, "God of War: Ascension" became available to play from Sony's <a href="Cloud%20gaming">game streaming</a> service <a href="PlayStation%20Now">PlayStation Now</a>.

"God of War: Ascension"s marketing campaign initially focused on its multiplayer feature. Between October 22, 2012, and the day of the game's release, there were four multiplayer trailers that featured each of the gods that players can align to, showcasing some of the abilities that players receive from them. On December 12, 2012, a multiplayer trailer titled "Evil Ways" was released, featuring Polyphemus. The first single-player trailer since the initial one in April 2012 came on January 19, 2013. A <a href="live%20action">live action</a> trailer titled "From Ashes" was played during <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVII">Super Bowl XLVII</a>, which was followed by the last single-player trailer on February 26.

On August 30, 2012, Santa Monica announced the release of the "Collector's Edition" for European territories.

"Rise of the Warrior" was a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> by Marianne Krawczyk with art by <a href="Christopher%20Shy">Christopher Shy</a>. Only available on GodofWar.com, it was a prequel story that tied into "Ascension"s single-player and multiplayer modes, and had 20 chapters that were released from October 2012 to March 2013. It also featured a <a href="Social%20network%20game">social experience</a> during that same time period. For the social experience, players were aligned with either the Spartans or the Trojans and competed via social challenges to earn points, such as answering questions and solving riddles for each chapter. In the first challenge, the teams competed to earn their army a week of exclusive, early access to the multiplayer beta test that began on December 12, and a one-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, which was won by the Spartans; the Trojans received access on December 17. The Spartans also won the next team challenge and received early access to the Prison of the Damned single-player demo on February 20, 2013. Players could also earn early, in-game unlocks for the final game's multiplayer mode, including exclusive weapons and armor for all players who attained the rank of Champion of the Gods.

The story followed an unnamed warrior who became the player's character in the multiplayer mode. The warrior was a native of Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of <a href="Aeaea">Aeaea</a> and recruited the witch <a href="Circe">Circe</a>, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.

After traveling through Delphi, the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and the warrior encountered the general, who was revealed to be the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general. Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach the general, who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The warrior refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die. The Giver, who followed the two, reminded the warrior that if he were to kill the general, who was a member of his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken. The warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. However, he tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because the warrior killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken. The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.

As well as the downloadable content (DLC) included in the "Collector's Edition", the pre-order bonuses, and DLC from "Rise of the Warrior", the developers released several multiplayer DLC packs after the game's release. All multiplayer maps that were released post-launch are free, and players who obtained the Season Pass from the "Collector's Edition" received all DLC weapons and armors at no additional cost. DLC weapons and armors can be purchased separately or in bundles. Other DLC, such as XP boosters, is available; these were not covered by the Season Pass. On May 7, 2013, the first set of DLC armors and weapons, including the "Armors of Anarchy" and the "Blades of Darkness", were released for purchase together with the free Chimeran Armor. Several other DLC packs, such as the "Primordials Pack", the "Champions Pack", the "Marks of the Gods Pack", and the "Legendary Spears Pack", were released.

In June 2013, Santa Monica announced the "Community Cape Design Contest", in which the "God of War" community could create and submit original cape designs. The winner's design was released as DLC. For a limited time the following month, Sony allowed players to trial all available DLC weapons. Some of the last sets of DLC released included co-op weapons, the "Mantles of the Gods Pack", several gauntlets, and the "Fury Capes Pack". On October 11, 2013, Santa Monica announced that no further DLC maps, weapons, armors, or marks would be produced, but multiplayer gaming would still be supported with patch updates. All DLC items received special pricing options for the release of the digital version of "God of War: Ascension". To celebrate the one year anniversary of the game's release, from March 25 through April 2, all DLC armor and weapons were available to download for free, XP boosters were discounted by 50%, and the developers released a Santa Monica Studio cape and a "Marked One" mark, allowing player's warriors to have Kratos' red tattoo when equipped.

The first maps were released via patch 1.06, called the "Hunter" update, on May 23, 2013. The "Tower of Delphi" and a modified version of the "Coliseum of Persia", which added Trial of the Gods mode, were included in this update. Because of technical difficulties experienced by some players who downloaded the patch, it was retracted and re-released via update 1.07 on June 3. Players who lost all online progress due to 1.06 received two 48-hour voucher codes granting five times the amount of XP earned, the Season Pass, 50 weapon and armor shards, and a special voucher code for the "Ascension" feature that ascended these players to "Hero", giving them immediate access to the Godly weapons and armors. The second set of maps were released via update 1.09 on July 11. This update included four maps for the Bout of Honor mode—"Canyons of Kirra", "Chamber of the Flame", "Landing at Delos", and "Streets of Sparta"—and a four-player map, "The Whirlpool of Alecto". On August 1, update 1.10 was released and added Trial of the Gods to the "Labyrinth of Daedalus" map. The last multiplayer map, the eight-player "Furnace of Archimedes", was released via update 1.11 on August 27.

"God of War: Ascension (Original Soundtrack)" was composed by <a href="Tyler%20Bates">Tyler Bates</a> and was released on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> on March 5, 2013 by SCE and La-La Land Records. It was included as DLC in the "God of War: Ascension—Collector's Edition" and "Special Edition". On October 15, the soundtrack was made available for free on PSN for a limited time. A notable feature of "Ascension"s soundtrack is that it was scored by only one composer; all the previous games had multiple composers. Tyler Bates previously scored the similarly themed film "300" and game "<a href="Rise%20of%20the%20Argonauts">Rise of the Argonauts</a>". Bates said "My goal was to create a sound that supported the timeless dark age of "God of War", while expanding the parameters of the '<a href="Peplum%20%28film%20genre%29">Sword and Sandals</a>' genre." Although the game's story is linear, he approached the project as if he were scoring a novel as opposed to a film. Bates did not play any of the previous games and chose not to in order to take the score "to new places without being overtly aware of the great music that is emblematic" of the prior installments. The soundtrack was recorded at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a>, and features solo vocal work from Rafe Pearlman and Ciscandra Nostalghia.

Throughout the score, Bates uses a combination of techniques "to increase the drama of the game" said Emily McMillan of Game Music Online, who gave the album a 4 out of 5 stars. She said one of Bates's signature techniques is "an intense and simultaneous crescendo and glissando." All of the themes take place on a <a href="harmonic%20minor%20scale">harmonic minor scale</a>. On the track, "Warriors' Truth", Bates used <a href="Gerard%20Marino">Gerard Marino</a>'s main "God of War" theme and "twists it for the prequel setting", "taking the harmonic ascending scale and reverting it to a downwards pattern with a harsh choir/brass combination." The track "Visions of Ruin" features the <a href="cimbalom">cimbalom</a>, which is rarely used in video game soundtracks. She said overall "The music is powerful, rich, and pulsing", though listening to the whole album can seem repetitive.

"God of War: Ascension" received generally favorable reviews upon release. Aggregating review websites <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave it an average review score of 79.34% (based on 58 reviews) and 80/100 (based on 89 reviews), respectively. Critics praised the fundamental gameplay and spectacle, but were critical of the lack of new ideas and gave a mixed response to the additional multiplayer mode. Alex Simmons of IGN said the redesigned combat system adds a source of depth: "Learning how to use each power effectively ... provides a strategic lifeline when there's no energy re-gen chest nearby". Although he initially found the World Weapons useful, he felt that they became unnecessary after upgrading the Blades of Chaos. Simmons felt the magic system was a "positive step"; since magic attacks are unlocked at a later time, players cannot rely on them as much as they may have done in previous installments, which encourages players "to think wisely about where to allocate experience points rather than being the ultimate badass from the outset".

Combat and the new gameplay mechanics were well-received, with Dale North of <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> saying ""God of War" has never looked or played better than this", and Xav de Matos of Joystiq commenting that the combat is simpler than in "God of War III", and rarely required much adjustment. Opinions on difficulty varied; Simmons felt that most of the gameplay was balanced, and that "Ascension" "is probably the easiest" in the series, but both he and Hollander Cooper of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> commented that some areas, such as the Trials of Archimedes, were too difficult. Simmons felt that in some sections, the many enemies made dying feel "cheap and frustrating", and in Cooper's opinion, some points in the game "[test] your patience, rather than your skills—including one [the Trials] that's easily the most difficult section in any "God of War" game to date, for all the wrong reasons".

Both Simmons and Matos criticized the story; Simmons felt that although the narrative is "meticulously delivered", it "felt a bit incidental", and said that in comparison to Zeus and Ares, "the Furies don't quite cut it". Matos was critical of the plot framing and the narrative structure as "just too chaotic"; he argued that "the narrative fabric woven throughout the franchise has begun to split", and "Ascension" does little to enhance its characters "in any meaningful way". He did praise the game for providing the "distinct "God of War" flair" known to the series.

Cooper praised the enhanced graphics engine as "not only the best the franchise has seen, but some of the most impressive on the PlayStation 3", and was impressed by Kratos' foes. North agreed, saying "there's a shine and polish that runs throughout the game that makes it a perfect send-off for the PS3", noting its improved textures, animations, and lighting. The review from "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" magazine also positively reviewed the graphics, but had some frustrations with the visual approach, such as some camera angles.

Matos was broadly critical of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience ... it doesn't feel deep enough to command much more than a furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is "a genuinely fresh addition ... that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [game]". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from "Edge" magazine described multiplayer mode as "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The "Edge" review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which "effectively lets you know when you have an opening and when to run".

Some reviewers disliked the title of one of the game's trophies, "Bros before Hos", which is received after graphically face-stomping a female villain. In response to the criticisms of misogyny, Santa Monica released a patch changing the name of the trophy to "Bros before Foes".

Unlike previous installments, "God of War: Ascension" won no awards, but it was nominated in several Best of E3 2012 categories by various media outlets. These nominations included "Best Action/Adventure" and "Best Multiplayer" from Game Rant, "Best PS3 Game" and "Best Action/Adventure Game" from <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a>, "Best PlayStation 3 Game" from Destructoid, and "Best PS3 Game" and "Best Action Game" from IGN. The game was a nominee for "Best Visual Design" at the 2013 <a href="Golden%20Joystick%20Awards">Golden Joystick Awards</a>. At the 2014 <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> Videogame Awards, it was a nominee for "Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing" and during the 2014 <a href="D.I.C.E.%20Summit">D.I.C.E. Summit</a>, it was a nominee for the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> award for "Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design".

Hugh de Neville

Hugh de Neville (died 1234) was the <a href="Chief%20Forester%20%28England%29">Chief Forester</a> under the kings <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England"></a>, <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">John</a> and <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England"></a> of England; he was the <a href="high%20sheriff">sheriff</a> for a number of <a href="Ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England">counties</a>. Related to a number of other royal officials as well as a bishop, Neville was a member of Prince Richard's <a href="medieval%20household">household</a>. After Richard became king in 1189, Neville continued in his service and accompanied him on the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>. Neville remained in the royal service following Richard's death in 1199 and the accession of King John to the throne, becoming one of the new king's favourites and often gambling with him. He was named in "<a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>" as one of John's principal advisers, and considered by a medieval chronicler to be one of King John's "evil counsellors". He deserted John after the <a href="First%20Barons%27%20War">French invasion of England in 1216</a> but returned to pledge his loyalty to John's son after the latter's accession to the throne later that year. Neville's royal service continued until his death in 1234, though by then he was a less significant figure than he had been at the height of his powers.

Neville was the son of Ralph de Neville, a son of <a href="Alan%20de%20Neville%20%28forester%29">Alan de Neville</a>, who was also Chief Forester. Hugh had a brother, <a href="Roger%20de%20Neville">Roger de Neville</a>, who was part of Hugh's household from 1202 to 1213, when Roger was given custody of <a href="Rockingham%20Castle">Rockingham Castle</a> by King John. Another brother was William, who was given some of Hugh's lands in 1217. Hugh, Roger, and William were related to a number of other royal officials and churchmen, most notable among them <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Neville%20%28died%201225%29">Geoffrey de Neville</a>, who was a <a href="chamberlain%20%28office%29">royal chamberlain</a>, and <a href="Ralph%20Neville">Ralph Neville</a>, who became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a>. Hugh de Neville employed Ralph de Neville at the start of Ralph's career, and the two appear to have remained on good terms throughout the rest of Hugh's life.

Hugh de Neville was a member of the household of Prince Richard, later , and also served Richard's father, King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> at the end of Henry's reign, administering two <a href="English%20feudal%20barony">baronies</a> for the king. Neville accompanied Richard on the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>; he was one of the few knights who <a href="Battle%20of%20Jaffa%20%281192%29">fought with the king</a> on 5 August 1192 outside the walls of <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a>, when the king and a small force of knights and crossbowmen fought off a surprise attack by <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>'s forces. Neville's account of events was a source for the chronicler <a href="Ralph%20of%20Coggeshall">Ralph of Coggeshall</a>'s entries on Richard's activities in the Third Crusade.

In 1194 Neville acquired the <a href="tenant-in-chief">wardship</a> of Joan de Cornhill, daughter of <a href="Henry%20de%20Cornhill%20%28sheriff%29">Henry de Cornhill</a>, and married her four years later. Also in 1194 he was given custody of the town of <a href="Marlborough%2C%20Wiltshire">Marlborough</a> in Wiltshire, and in 1196 he was appointed as <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Oxfordshire">Sheriff of Oxfordshire</a>. He was also named in 1197 as <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Essex">Sheriff of Essex</a> and <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Hertfordshire">Sheriff of Hertfordshire</a>, offices he held until some time in 1200.

Neville was appointed as Chief Forester under King Richard I in 1198. As the official in charge of the <a href="royal%20forest">royal forest</a>s, he held one of the four great offices of the state: the others were the <a href="justiciar">justiciar</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor%23History">chancellor</a>, and the <a href="Lord%20High%20Treasurer">treasurer</a>. The forester was responsible for enforcing the <a href="royal%20forest%23Forest%20law">forest law</a> – the special law that applied to the royal forests  – and presided over the <a href="Justice%20in%20Eyre">forest justices</a>, who held forest <a href="eyre%20%28legal%20term%29">eyres</a>. There was also a special forest <a href="exchequer">exchequer</a>, or forest treasury. In 1198 Neville presided over an <a href="Assize">Assize</a> of the Forest that was described by the chronicler <a href="Roger%20of%20Howden">Roger of Howden</a> as greatly oppressive. The revenues could be considerable; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in £1,980. Neville stated in 1208 that over the previous six and a half years the amount raised by the various revenues of the forests had been £15,000; in 1212 it had been £4,486. Forest law was resented by the king's subjects, not just for its severity but also because of the large extent of the kingdom that it encompassed. It covered not just woodlands, but by the end of the 12th century between a quarter and a third of the whole kingdom. This extent enabled the <a href="House%20of%20Normandy">Norman</a> and <a href="Angevin%20kings%20of%20England">Angevin</a> kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of money for their government.

Neville continued to hold the office of Chief Forester under King John and he was often the king's gambling partner. He was a frequent witness to John's <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a>s. Under John, Neville was named to the offices of <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Hampshire">Sheriff of Hampshire</a> in 1210, and <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cumberland">Sheriff of Cumberland</a>, offices of which he was deprived in 1212. He was also reappointed to the <a href="wikt%3Ashrievalty">shrievalties</a> of Essex and Hertfordshire in 1202, holding them until 1203.

In 1210 King John fined Neville 1,000 <a href="Mark%20%28currency%29%23England%20and%20Scotland">marks</a> because he had allowed <a href="Peter%20des%20Roches">Peter des Roches</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, to enclose some hunting grounds without royal permission; although Roches was close to the king, his action was an infringement of the royal forests. Neville's large fine was probably a warning that the king was serious about enforcing the forest law; it was eventually rescinded. In 1213 Neville was placed in charge of the seaports along the southwest English coast from <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> to <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, but some time in 1213 it appears that he fell from royal favour, although the circumstances are unknown. A fine of 6,000 marks was assessed on him for allowing two prisoners to escape, as well as other unrecorded offences, although the king did subsequently remit 1,000 marks of the fine. In 1215 Neville lost his office of chief forester. He was present at <a href="Runnymede">Runnymede</a> for the signing of "<a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>" and was mentioned in the preamble as one of King John's councillors, as well as serving as a witness to the document. <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a>, a chronicler writing in 1211, listed Neville as one of King John's "evil counsellors".

John's style of ruling, and his defeats in the <a href="Anglo-French%20War%20%281213%E2%80%931214%29">Anglo-French War</a> in 1214, had alienated many of his nobles. Initially, a faction of the barons forced John to agree to "Magna Carta" to secure less capricious government from the king. John, however, after agreeing to their demands, secured the annulment of the charter from the <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">papacy</a> in late 1215. The opposition magnates then invited Prince <a href="Louis%20VIII%20of%20France">Louis of France</a> to take the English throne, and Louis arrived in England with an army in May 1216.

Neville joined the rebel barons in 1216, shortly after Prince Louis invaded England. Neville surrendered <a href="Marlborough%20Castle">Marlborough Castle</a>, a royal castle in his custody, to Prince Louis in mid-1216. Louis had not besieged the castle, and it appears that Neville took the initiative in making overtures to the prince. When John heard of the change of sides, he confiscated all of Neville's lands held directly from the king on 1216. On 4 September 1216 the king further confiscated lands belonging to other rebels that had been granted to Neville before the surrender of Marlborough; some were re-granted to Neville's brother William. Hugh de Neville's son, Herbert, also joined the rebels.

After King John's death in October 1216, Neville and his son made their peace with the new king, Henry III, John's son. Both men had their lands restored in 1217, but the offices that the elder Neville had held were not returned quickly. Custody of some royal forests was returned by 1220, but the office of Chief Forester was not returned until some time later. In 1218 Neville was supposed to have had the <a href="Rockingham%20Forest">forest of Rockingham</a> returned to his custody, but <a href="William%20II%20de%20Forz%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Albemarle">William de Forz</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Aumale">Count of Aumale</a>, refused to return it. It was not until 1220 that de Neville managed to recover his custody of Rockingham forest. By 1224 Neville was once more Chief Forester, but he never regained the power and influence that he had held under John. When he lost the office for the second time is unclear. The historian C. R. Young states that he held the office until his death in 1234 when it passed to his son John, but Daniel Crook, writing in the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", claims that Neville lost the forester office in 1229, to be replaced by <a href="John%20of%20Monmouth">John of Monmouth</a> and <a href="Brian%20de%20Lisle">Brian de Lisle</a>. He also served as <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Lincolnshire">Sheriff of Lincolnshire</a>.

Neville's household records for 1207 survive, detailing his itinerary for the year; in one eight-week period his household visited eleven different towns. In 1204 his wife offered the king 200 chickens for the right to sleep one night with her husband, an obligation recorded in the royal records. The historian Daniel Crook suggests that this shows that Joan Neville was one of the barons' wives who attracted King John's sexual attentions.

Neville inherited lands in Lincolnshire worth one half of a <a href="knight%27s%20fee">knight's fee</a>. These were augmented with gifts from Richard and John, much of which were in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>. He also acquired lands in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> and in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, and his marriage to Joan brought him estates in Essex. Joan's lands also brought him into conflict with <a href="Falkes%20de%20Breaut%C3%A9">Falkes de Breauté</a>, the husband of Joan's younger sister and co-heiress, and the two brothers-in-law were involved in lawsuits over their wives' lands for more than five years. Joan and her sister were also co-heiresses to the barony of Courcy, in right of their mother Alice de Courcy.

Neville's first wife, Joan de Cornhill, died after December 1224. Some time before April 1230 he married secondly Beatrice, the widow of Ralph de Fay and one of the five daughters of <a href="Stephen%20of%20Thornham">Stephen of Turnham</a>. Joan and Neville had at least three sons – John, Henry, and Herbert. Neville also had a daughter named Joan.

Neville died in 1234, although his death was incorrectly recorded by <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a> as occurring in 1222. Neville was buried at <a href="Waltham%20Abbey%20%28abbey%29">Waltham Abbey</a>, of which he had been a patron. Besides Waltham, he also made gifts to <a href="Christ%20Church%20Priory">Christ Church Priory</a> in Canterbury, <a href="Bullington%20Priory">Bullington Priory</a> in Lincolnshire, and . The historian <a href="Sidney%20Painter">Sidney Painter</a> said of Neville's career during John's reign that "a strong argument could be advanced for the thesis that the royal official who wielded the most actual power during John's reign was the chief forester, Hugh de Neville". Another historian, J. R. Maddicott, states that Neville was head of "one of the most detested branches of royal administration".

McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet in Australian service

The <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) has operated <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> fighter aircraft since 1984. The <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Australian Government</a> purchased 75 "A" and "B" variants of the F/A-18 in 1981 to replace the RAAF's <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Dassault Mirage III</a> fighters. The Hornets entered service with the RAAF between 1984 and 1990, and 69 remain in operation as of 2019. Of the other six Hornets, four were destroyed in flying accidents during the late 1980s and early 1990s and two were transferred to Canada in February 2019.

RAAF Hornets were first sent on a combat deployment as part of the <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. During the invasion, 14 Hornets flew patrols over Iraq, as well as <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s to assist coalition ground forces. RAAF F/A-18s also provided security for the American air base at <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a> between late 2001 and early 2002, and have protected a number of high-profile events in Australia. Between 2015 and 2017 a detachment of Hornets was deployed to the Middle East and struck <a href="ISIL">ISIL</a> targets as part of <a href="Operation%20Okra">Operation Okra</a>.

Since 1999 the RAAF has put its Hornets through a series of upgrades to improve their effectiveness. However, the aircraft are becoming increasingly difficult to operate and are at risk of being outclassed by the fighters and air-defence systems operated by other countries. As a result, the RAAF will begin to retire its F/A-18s in the late 2010s, and the last aircraft will leave service in the early 2020s. Under current Australian Government planning they will be replaced by 72 <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</a> fighters. The Australian Government has offered the Hornets for sale once they are no longer needed by the RAAF, and finalised a deal to sell 25 of the aircraft to Canada in early 2019.

The RAAF began the initial stages of scoping a replacement for its <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Dassault Mirage III</a> fighters in 1968. The service issued an Air Staff Requirement for new fighter aircraft in December 1971, which received a larger than expected number of proposals from manufacturers. At this time the RAAF expected to start phasing out the Mirage IIIs in 1980. In 1973, a team of RAAF personnel inspected the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15%20Eagle">McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle</a>, <a href="Northrop%20YF-17">Northrop YF-17</a>, <a href="Saab%2037%20Viggen">Saab 37 Viggen</a> and <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20F1">Dassault Mirage F1</a> programs, but recommended that any decisions about a suitable replacement be delayed so that several new fighters that were expected to soon become available could also be considered. In August 1974 the Australian Government decided to defer the fighter replacement project and extend the Mirage IIIs' operational life into the 1980s. One of the four Mirage III-equipped squadrons was also disbanded at this time. 
Work on the Mirage replacement program resumed in 1975, and the Tactical Fighter Project Office was established in 1976 to manage the process of selecting the RAAF's next fighter. A request for proposals was issued in November that year and attracted eleven responses. By March 1977 the office had chosen to focus on the F-15 Eagle, <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>, <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%202000">Dassault Mirage 2000</a> and <a href="Panavia%20Tornado">Panavia Tornado</a>, as well as the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F-18A</a> and F-18L; the F-18A was a carrier-based fighter developed from the YF-17 for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, and the F-18L was a land-based variant of this design. The <a href="Grumman%20F-14%20Tomcat">Grumman F-14 Tomcat</a> was also considered by the project office, but was regarded as unsuitable and never placed on the official shortlist. In November 1978 the F-15 and Tornado were removed from the list of aircraft being considered. The Tornado was excluded as it was principally a strike aircraft and had limited air-to-air capability. While the F-15 was an impressive aircraft that met or exceeded almost all of the RAAF's requirements, it was believed that the air force did not need a fighter with such advanced capabilities and that introducing it into service could destabilise Australia's region.

Further evaluation of the remaining aircraft took place during 1979. Wing Commander (and later Air Vice-Marshal) <a href="Robert%20Richardson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Bob Richardson</a> test-flew a Mirage 2000 in April 1979, and reported that while the aircraft had excellent aerodynamic characteristics, its avionics, radar, fuel system, cockpit and weapons capability were inferior to those of US designs. Richardson also test-flew a YF-17 that was being used as a demonstrator for the F-18L in mid-1979, and was impressed by its capabilities. No F-18Ls had been ordered at this time, however, and the RAAF did not want to take on the risk of being the lead customer for the design. At about the same time, the RAAF rejected an offer of F-14 Tomcats that had been originally ordered by the Iranian Government but not delivered as a result of the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">revolution in that country</a>. While the Tomcats were made available at a greatly reduced price, the air force judged that these aircraft were too large and complex for its requirements. 
With the Mirage 2000 and F-18L rejected, the RAAF was faced with a choice between the F-16 and F-18A. Richardson and several other RAAF pilots tested <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) F-16Bs in 1979 and 1980, and reported that the aircraft had excellent performance but could be difficult to control at times. The evaluation team was also concerned about the reliability of the F-16's engine and regarded the aircraft as technologically immature. It was also noted that the aircraft's radar was inferior to that of the F-18A, and that F-16s could not fire the beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and long-range anti-shipping missiles that the F-18A was capable of operating. In contrast, the evaluation team was impressed by the F-18A, and regarded it as being a more robust and survivable aircraft as it had been designed to operate from <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s; these features were important for operations from <a href="RAAF%20bare%20bases">bare bases</a> in northern Australia. Richardson and three other RAAF pilots test-flew F-18As, and reported that the aircraft handled well, but had some deficiencies with its flight control system and engines; these were not seen as major flaws by the evaluation team, however. The F-18A's twin engines were considered to be its main advantage over the single-engined F-16, as research conducted by the evaluation team found that the attrition rate for single-engined fighters was twice that for aircraft with two engines. Overall, however, the RAAF judged that both the F-16 and F-18A were too immature for a decision to be made in 1980 as had been originally planned, and recommended to the Government that this be deferred by a year.

The Government accepted the RAAF's recommendation, and delayed its decision on a Mirage III replacement until late 1981. This gave General Dynamics an opportunity to offer the improved F-16C to the RAAF. The capability of these aircraft was closer to that of the F-18 as they were equipped with BVR missiles. Richardson and another RAAF pilot test-flew F-16Cs in May 1981. The F-18 design was also improved during 1981, and was redesignated the F/A-18. When RAAF test pilots flew these aircraft during 1981, they found that the deficiencies they had detected in 1980 were now addressed. Overall, the RAAF concluded that while both aircraft met its requirements and the F-16 was less expensive, the F/A-18 was the superior design as it was more technologically mature, easier to maintain during operational deployments, and likely to have a much lower attrition rate. The Government accepted this advice, and announced on 20 October 1981 that 75 F/A-18s would be ordered. As part of this announcement, Minister for Defence <a href="James%20Killen">Jim Killen</a> acknowledged that the F-16 would have been seven percent cheaper to purchase, but stated that the F/A-18's lower running costs and expected attrition rate greatly reduced the difference between the lifetime cost of the two designs.

Instead of directly ordering the aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, the Australian Government purchased its F/A-18s through the US Government's <a href="Foreign%20Military%20Sales">Foreign Military Sales</a> (FMS) program. Ordering the aircraft via the US Government allowed the RAAF to take advantage of the superior purchasing power of the US military, and reduced the service's project management requirements. This led to a complicated arrangement whereby the aircraft were ordered by the US Government, delivered to the US Navy, and then transferred to the RAAF once initial flight testing had taken place. The process functioned smoothly, however, and was cost effective.

The RAAF's order of 75 Hornets comprised 57 single-seat "A" variant fighters and 18 two-seat "B" variant operational training aircraft. It was planned that each of the three fighter <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a>s and the single <a href="operational%20conversion%20unit">operational conversion unit</a> that were to operate the F/A-18 would be allocated 16 aircraft, of which 12 were expected to be operational at any time while the other four were undergoing maintenance. The remaining eleven Hornets were labelled the "half-life attrition buy" and would replace the aircraft that were expected to have been lost by 2000; as it happened, this greatly exceeded the RAAF's actual losses. Deliveries were planned to start in late 1984 and be completed in 1990. The total cost of the F/A-18 program, including the aircraft, spare parts, other equipment and modifications to the RAAF's fighter bases, was calculated as A$2.427 billion in August 1981, but was rapidly revised upwards due to the depreciation of the Australian dollar at this time.

The Australian Hornets were very similar to the standard US Navy variants, but incorporated a number of minor modifications. These included the addition of an Instrument Landing System/Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (ILS/VOR) system, a high-frequency radio, a different <a href="ejection%20seat">ejection seat</a> harness and the deletion of all equipment used only to launch the aircraft from <a href="Aircraft%20catapult">catapults</a>. In addition, two of the Australian aircraft were fitted with flight-test instrumentation so that they could be used as part of trials.
The Government sought to use the Mirage III replacement program as a means to increase the capabilities of Australia's manufacturing industry. Accordingly, it was decided to build the aircraft in Australia, though it was recognised that this would lead to higher costs than if the fighters were purchased directly from the United States. While the first two RAAF Hornets were built in the United States, the remainder were assembled at the <a href="Government%20Aircraft%20Factories">Government Aircraft Factories</a> plant at <a href="Avalon%20Airport">Avalon Airport</a> in Victoria, and their engines were produced by the <a href="Commonwealth%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation</a> at <a href="Port%20Melbourne%2C%20Victoria%23Fishermans%20Bend">Fishermans Bend</a> in Melbourne. Another twelve Australian companies were involved in other stages of the project. These firms were sub-contracted to McDonnell Douglas and the other major US companies that produced components for the F/A-18, and had to comply with the requirements of the FMS program. The Australian Government hoped that Singapore and New Zealand would purchase Australian-built Hornets, but this did not eventuate. The Canadian Government expressed interest in purchasing 25 Australian-built F/A-18As in 1988 in order to increase its force of these aircraft after they had ceased to be manufactured in the United States, but this did not lead to any sales.
The Australian Hornets began to roll off the production lines in 1984. The first two aircraft (<a href="Aircraft%20registration">serial numbers</a> A21-101 and A21-102) were entirely built at McDonnell Douglas' factory in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a>, and were handed over to the RAAF on 29 October 1984. These aircraft remained in the United States until May 1985 for training and trials purposes. The next two Australian Hornets (A21-103 and A21-104) were also built at St. Louis, but were then disassembled and flown to Avalon in June 1984 on board a USAF <a href="Lockheed%20C-5%20Galaxy">Lockheed C-5 Galaxy</a>. The aircraft were then reassembled, and A21-103 was rolled out at a ceremony attended by Prime Minister <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a> and the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Marshal <a href="David%20Evans%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">David Evans</a>, on 16 November. However, the aircraft's initial test flight was delayed until 26 February 1985 by a <a href="demarcation%20dispute">demarcation dispute</a> over which category of pilot was permitted to fly the aircraft.

In order to meet production targets, GAF was required to complete 1.5 Hornets per month. Production fell behind schedule during the first half of 1987, however, as a result of inefficiencies at the company's factory and industrial relations problems. GAF was able to accelerate production later in the year, though some components that were planned to be manufactured in Australia were purchased from companies in the United States instead. The final cost of the Hornet project was A$4.668 billion; after adjusting for the depreciation of the Australian dollar this was $186 million less than the initial estimate.

The RAAF began to accept Hornets into service in 1985. A21-103 was formally delivered on 4 May of that year. Two weeks later, A21-101 and 102 were flown from <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Lemoore">Naval Air Station Lemoore</a> in California to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a> in New South Wales between 16 and 17 May 1985. This ferry flight was conducted as a non-stop journey, and USAF <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20KC-10%20Extender">McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender</a> tankers refuelled each of the Hornets 15 times as they crossed the Pacific. As of 2005 this remained the longest single flight to have been undertaken by F/A-18s. Despite the delays to production in 1987, the final Australian Hornet (A21-57) was delivered on schedule at a ceremony held in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> on 16 May 1990. The F/A-18As were allocated serial numbers A21-1 through to A21-57 and the F/A-18Bs were allocated A21-101 to A21-118.

A major capital works program was also undertaken to prepare RAAF bases for the Hornets. Over $150 million was spent upgrading the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, which has been the main F/A-18 base throughout the aircraft's service. The pre-existing airfield at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Tindal">RAAF Base Tindal</a> in the Northern Territory was also developed into a major air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $215 million so that it could accommodate <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron</a>. Until this time the squadron had been stationed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Base Darwin</a> which, due to its location on Australia's north coast, was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend during wartime.

Owing to concerns over the airworthiness of the RAAF's <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111%20Aardvark">General Dynamics F-111</a> bombers and delays to the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</a> program, the Australian Government ordered 24 <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18F Super Hornets</a> in 2006. This design is significantly different from the original (or "classic") Hornet, however. The RAAF's first Super Hornets entered service in 2010 and deliveries were completed the next year. In 2013 the Australian Government ordered 12 <a href="Boeing%20EA-18G%20Growler">Boeing EA-18G Growler</a> electronic warfare variants of the Super Hornet, and all were delivered to the RAAF between 2015 and 2017.

Maintenance of the RAAF's Hornets is carried out by both air force personnel and civilian contractors. Until the early 1990s, all routine servicing and a significant proportion of intensive <a href="Aircraft%20maintenance%20checks">"deeper maintenance"</a> was undertaken by the air force. However, the share of intensive maintenance tasks outsourced to the private sector was increased during the 1990s under the RAAF-wide Commercial Support Program. Under current arrangements, the four Hornet-equipped units undertake all routine servicing and some of the more complex deeper maintenance tasks. The remainder of the deeper maintenance work, as well as all major refurbishments and upgrade projects, are carried out by commercial firms. <a href="BAE%20Systems">BAE Systems</a> has been the lead contractor for Hornet deeper maintenance since 2003, and <a href="Boeing%20Australia">Boeing Australia</a> has also provided maintenance services for the aircraft since it won a contract to do so in 2010. In August 2017 Boeing's contract was extended until the planned retirement of the Hornets in 2021, with the company also gaining responsibility for integrating weapons onto the type. This change was made to free up RAAF personnel for activities associated with introducing the F-35 into service.

The RAAF's Hornet fleet received few modifications until the late 1990s. During this period, the <a href="AN/AAS-38">AN/AAS-38 "Nite Hawk"</a> targeting pod was the only new system fitted to the aircraft. However, several Asian countries introduced <a href="Mikoyan%20MiG-29">Mikoyan MiG-29</a> fighters into service during the 1990s, raising concerns that the RAAF's aircraft would be outclassed. The air force considered replacing the Hornet with the <a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a> or <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet</a>, but concluded that both aircraft were technologically immature. As a result, it was decided to upgrade the Hornets.
The Hornet Upgrade Program (HUG) began in 1999, and has had three main phases. In Phase 1, which ran from mid-2000 through 2002, the Hornets' computer systems, navigation system and radio were replaced. The aircraft were also fitted to operate the <a href="ASRAAM">ASRAAM</a> air-to-air missile; these weapons replaced the <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a>. HUG Phase 2 comprised four sub-elements and sought to improve the Hornets' combat performance. During Phase 2.1 the <a href="APG-65%20and%20APG-73">APG-65</a> radar was replaced with the improved <a href="APG-65%20and%20APG-73">AN/APG-73</a>, and the aircraft were fitted with a secure voice encryption communications system as well as various updates to their computer systems. In HUG Phase 2.2, the most important element of the program, the Hornets were fitted with a <a href="Helmet%20mounted%20display%23Joint%20Helmet%20Mounted%20Cueing%20System%20%28JHMCS%29">Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System</a>, equipment needed to share data through the <a href="Link%2016">Link 16</a> network, a new countermeasures dispensing system and several upgrades to their cockpit displays. All of the Hornets were upgraded to this standard between January 2005 and December 2006. In Phase 2.3, an improved <a href="Electronic%20Counter%20Measures">Electronic Counter Measures</a> system was fitted to the Hornets; the <a href="AN/ALR-2002">AN/ALR-2002</a> was originally selected, but proved unsuccessful. It was replaced by the <a href="ALR-67%20Radar%20Warning%20Receiver">ALR-67 Radar Warning Receiver</a> in late 2006. As of early 2012, 14 Hornets had been fitted with the system and the remainder were scheduled to receive it by the end of the year. During HUG Phase 2.4 the Hornets were modified to be able to use the <a href="LITENING%20targeting%20pod">AN/AAQ-28(v) "LITENING"</a> targeting pod and 37 of these systems were purchased; this phase was completed in 2007.

The third stage of the Hornet Upgrade Program sought to rectify airframe damage. HUG Phase 3.1 involved minor structural work to all aircraft as they passed through other phases of the program. The centre fuselages of the ten Hornets assessed as suffering the greatest amount of structural damage were replaced in HUG Phase 3.2. It was originally intended that all the RAAF's Hornets would receive new centre fuselages, but the scope of this phase of the program was reduced after it was found that the number of man-hours needed to upgrade each aircraft was much greater than originally estimated. The ten aircraft were upgraded at an <a href="L-3%20Communications">L-3 Communications</a> facility in Canada, and all were returned to service by June 2010.

The long-running HUG process complicated the RAAF's management of its fleet of F/A-18s. At any one time, the capabilities of individual aircraft differed considerably depending on their upgrades. Accordingly, the long-standing arrangement where aircraft were almost permanently assigned to each squadron was replaced by a system where they were pooled. Attempts to allocate Hornets with similar levels of modifications from the common pool to each squadron were not successful.

The RAAF's Hornets have been fitted with several different types of air-to-air weapons. The aircraft are equipped with an internal <a href="M61%20Vulcan">M61A1</a> cannon for use against air and ground targets; 578 rounds can be carried for this weapon. During the initial years of the Hornet's service, the aircraft were equipped with <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">AIM-9M Sidewinder</a> short range air-to-air missiles and <a href="AIM-7%20Sparrow">AIM-7M Sparrow</a> medium-range air-to-air missiles. The Sparrows were replaced by the <a href="AIM-120%20AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a> in 2002, and in 2004 the Sidewinders were replaced by <a href="ASRAAM">ASRAAM</a>s. The older missiles are occasionally used in training exercises, however.

A variety of unguided and guided weapons can also be used against ground targets. The Hornets carry <a href="Mark%2082%20bomb">Mark 82</a>, <a href="Mark%2083%20bomb">Mark 83</a> and <a href="Mark%2084%20bomb">Mark 84</a> bombs, as well as <a href="GBU-10%20Paveway%20II">GBU-10</a>, <a href="GBU-12%20Paveway%20II">GBU-12</a> and <a href="GBU-16%20Paveway%20II">GBU-16 Paveway II</a> laser-guided bombs. In addition, the aircraft have operated bombs fitted with <a href="Joint%20Direct%20Attack%20Munition">JDAM</a> guidance kits since 2008. The long-ranged JDAM-ER variant of these bombs were ordered in 2011 and will begin to enter service in 2015. During exercises the Hornets carry <a href="BDU-33">BDU-33</a> and <a href="BDU-57%20LGTR">BDU-57 LGTR</a> training bombs. Since November 2011, the RAAF's Hornets have also been equipped with <a href="AGM-158%20JASSM">AGM-158 JASSM</a> cruise missiles. The F/A-18s main weapon in the maritime strike role is the <a href="Harpoon%20%28missile%29">Harpoon</a> anti-ship missile; the RAAF initially operated the Block IC variant of this missile, but purchased Block II variants in 2003. In addition to these weapons, the Hornets can also be fitted with <a href="drop%20tank">drop tank</a>s to extend their range.

Four RAAF units converted to the Hornet between 1985 and 1988. The first 14 Hornets were allocated to <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit</a> (2OCU) at RAAF Base Williamtown, and were used to train the pilots and instructors needed to convert the RAAF's three fighter squadrons to the aircraft. 2OCU's first Hornet operational conversion course began on 19 August 1985. In addition to the unit's training activities, 2OCU aircraft travelled widely around Australia and South East Asia during 1985 and 1986 to showcase the new aircraft. <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> was the first fighter unit to convert from the Mirage III, and became operational with the Hornet in August 1986. It was followed by <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron</a> in June 1987 and No. 75 Squadron in May 1988. <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a>, whose headquarters is located at Williamtown, has commanded these four units since they converted to the F/A-18. As of 2012, 2OCU, No. 3 and No. 77 Squadrons are stationed at Williamtown and No. 75 Squadron is located at Tindal. In addition, two Hornets are allocated to the <a href="Aircraft%20Research%20and%20Development%20Unit%20RAAF">Aircraft Research and Development Unit</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Edinburgh">RAAF Base Edinburgh</a> in South Australia.
The RAAF's Mirage III pilots generally found the process of converting to the Hornet to be straightforward. While the F/A-18 was considered to be easier to fly, its more sophisticated avionics and weapons systems required improved cockpit workload management skills. The Hornets have also proven to be mechanically reliable and easy to maintain, though shortages of spare parts reduced availability rates during the early years of their service with the RAAF. The updates installed as part of the HUG process have further simplified maintenance procedures. In recent years, however, the aging aircraft have required much more servicing than was the case in the past.

To extend the Hornet's range, four of the RAAF's six <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a> transport aircraft were converted to <a href="Aerial%20refueling">tankers</a> in the early 1990s; the first Boeing 707 tanker entered service in 1990. The tankers were operated by <a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 33 Squadron</a> and supported the Hornet units until the 707s were retired in 2008. These aircraft were replaced with <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">KC-30A</a> tanker-transports in 2011.

The RAAF has at times suffered from shortfalls of Hornet-qualified pilots. The service began to experience shortages of F/A-18 and F-111 fast-jet pilots in the mid-1980s due to competition from commercial airlines and relatively low recruitment rates. By June 1999 the three operational Hornet-equipped squadrons had only 40 pilots, which was less than the number of aircraft allocated to these units. The RAAF claimed that the squadrons were able to meet their readiness targets, however. To overcome this shortfall, the RAAF gave its fast jet units a higher priority for aircrew, implemented measures to reduce separation rates, and recruited pilots from other countries. These reforms coincided with reduced demand for civil pilots following the <a href="11%20September%20attacks">11 September attacks</a>, and by late 2003 the RAAF's fast-jet units were at near full strength. A 2010 article in the magazine <a href="Australian%20Aviation%20%28magazine%29">"Australian Aviation"</a> stated that No. 3 Squadron typically had "about 18 pilots on strength" at any point in time. At this time the total strength of the squadron, including air and ground crew, was around 300 personnel.

As the Hornets are multi-role fighters, their pilots practice a wide range of tasks during peacetime training. Each year the three Hornet squadrons rotate between four-month training "blocks" focused on air-to-air combat, air-to-ground tactics and <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> support tasks. The units undertake the air-to-air and air-to-ground "blocks" before assuming responsibility for Australian Defence Force support (which involves operating with the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>). No. 81 Wing's headquarters oversees this training program and monitors adherence to common standards and procedures. Training sorties may include such tasks as defending air bases, infrastructure and shipping from enemy aircraft, attacking naval and ground targets, and practicing in-flight refueling. More unusual tasks such as dropping <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s have also been practiced at times. Major exercises often involve other RAAF units and aircraft, as well as units from the Army and Navy and contingents from other countries.

As part of their regular training activities, F/A-18 Hornets operate in different parts of Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. Regular deployments are made to Singapore and <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">RMAF Butterworth</a> in Malaysia as part of <a href="Integrated%20Air%20Defence%20System">Integrated Air Defence System</a> exercises. In addition, RAAF F/A-18s have participated in exercises in the Philippines, Thailand and the United States. These deployments have seen Australian fighter squadrons range as far afield as <a href="Eielson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Eielson Air Force Base</a> in Alaska, where they took part in <a href="Red%20Flag%20%E2%80%93%20Alaska">Red Flag – Alaska</a> exercises in 2008 and 2011.

Four of the RAAF's Hornets were destroyed in flying accidents during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A21-104 was the first aircraft to be lost when it crashed at <a href="Great%20Palm%20Island">Great Palm Island</a> in Queensland on 18 November 1987; its pilot was killed. The next loss occurred on 2 August 1990 when two No. 75 Squadron Hornets (A21-29 and A21-42) collided. A21-42 crashed, killing the unit's commanding officer; the other aircraft was damaged but managed to return to base. On 5 June 1990 A21-41 crashed north-east of <a href="Weipa%2C%20Queensland">Weipa, Queensland</a>, killing its pilot. A21-106 was the fourth aircraft to be lost when it crashed inland from <a href="Shoalwater%20Bay">Shoalwater Bay</a> in Queensland on 19 May 1992 – its pilot and a passenger from the <a href="Defence%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation">Defence Science and Technology Organisation</a> died. As of September 2017, all of the remaining 71 F/A-18s were still in service. Aviation writer Nigel Pittaway has noted that the type has "enjoyed an exemplary safety record during its RAAF service", especially when compared to the loss of 41 of the RAAF's 116 Mirages due to accidents.

In late 1990 consideration was given to deploying a squadron of F/A-18s to the Middle East as part of an expanded <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%201991%20Gulf%20War">Australian contribution to the Gulf War</a>. The <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a> opposed dispatching the aircraft on the grounds that doing so would greatly strain the fighter force in Australia, and this option was not adopted by the government. As a result, the Hornets' only role in the war was to support the training of the Royal Australian Navy warships which were sent to the Gulf by conducting mock attacks on the vessels as they sailed from Sydney to Perth.

During late 1999, No. 75 Squadron was placed on alert to provide close air support and air defence for the international forces deployed to <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> as part of <a href="INTERFET">INTERFET</a>. While Indonesian forces posed a potential threat to this force, no fighting eventuated and the Hornets were not required.

The first operational deployment of RAAF Hornets took place in 2001. Following the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">11 September terrorist attacks</a>, the Australian Government agreed to deploy F/A-18s to protect the major USAF air base on the Indian Ocean island of <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a>, which was being used to mount operations in Afghanistan. Four No. 77 Squadron Hornets and 70 personnel departed for the island on 9 November. No. 3 Squadron pilots and ground crew relieved the No. 77 Squadron personnel in early February 2002. RAAF Hornets were not assigned to the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a> as at the time they were less capable than other available coalition aircraft. While the F/A-18s were occasionally scrambled in response to reports of aircraft near the base, no threat developed. The detachment returned to Australia on 21 May 2002.

No. 75 Squadron formed part of the <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. The squadron began initial planning for this deployment in December 2002, and intensive training was undertaken from January 2003. To improve the unit's readiness, air and ground crew as well as aircraft were also posted to No. 75 Squadron from other units. The Australian Government announced on 1 February that it would begin deploying RAAF aircraft, including a squadron of F/A-18s, to the Middle East. No. 75 Squadron departed from Tindal on 13 February, and arrived at <a href="Al%20Udeid%20Air%20Base">Al Udeid Air Base</a> in Qatar on the 16th of the month. The 14 F/A-18A Hornets selected for this deployment had received the HUG 2.1 package of upgrades and recently completed major servicing. These upgrades allowed the F/A-18s to operate alongside other coalition aircraft. In addition to No. 75 Squadron, several experienced Hornet pilots were also posted to the USAF <a href="Air%20and%20Space%20Operations%20Center">Combined Air and Space Operations Center</a> in the Middle East to provide advice on how to make the best use of the squadron.

The Australian Hornets saw combat in several roles during the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. Following the outbreak of war on 20 March, No. 75 Squadron was initially used to escort high-value Coalition aircraft, such as tankers and <a href="airborne%20early%20warning%20and%20control">airborne early warning and control</a> aircraft. As it rapidly became clear that the <a href="Iraqi%20Air%20Force">Iraqi Air Force</a> posed no threat, from 21 March No. 75 Squadron also began to also conduct <a href="air%20interdiction">air interdiction</a> sorties against Iraqi forces. These sorties were initially flown in support of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army's</a> <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">V Corps</a>, but the squadron was rarely assigned any targets to attack. As a result, the Australian commanders in the Middle East had No. 75 Squadron reassigned to support the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps'</a> <a href="I%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Force">I Marine Expeditionary Force</a>. At this time the squadron also began flying <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> sorties. During the first two weeks of the war the squadron typically flew 12 sorties per day. To avoid pilot fatigue, additional aircrew were posted to the Middle East from Australia. The number of sorties dropped to between six and ten per day from 5 April onwards as the American forces closed on <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and few targets remained in southern Iraq. On 12 April, No. 75 Squadron supported elements of the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">Special Air Service Regiment</a> and <a href="4th%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a>, which occupied <a href="Al%20Asad%20Airbase">Al Asad Airbase</a>. During the last weeks of the war the squadron continued to fly sorties across western, central and southern Iraq to support British and American forces. In several of the squadron's operations in the final week of the war, the Hornets made low altitude and high speed passes over Iraqi positions to encourage their defenders to surrender. No. 75 Squadron conducted its final combat sorties on 27 April. During the war the squadron flew 350 combat missions (including 670 individual sorties) and dropped 122 laser-guided bombs. No. 75 Squadron did not suffer any casualties, and all 14 Hornets returned to Tindal on 14 May 2003.
RAAF Hornets have also provided air defence for several high-profile events in Australia since the 11 September attacks. In 2002, Hornets patrolled over the <a href="Commonwealth%20Heads%20of%20Government%20Meeting%202002">Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting</a> (CHOGM) at <a href="Coolum%20Beach%2C%20Queensland">Coolum Beach, Queensland</a>; this was the first time RAAF aircraft had flown air defence sorties over Australia since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. On 22 and 23 October that year a detachment of Hornets patrolled over Canberra during US President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>'s visit to the city. A detachment of aircraft from No. 77 Squadron was deployed to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">RAAF Base East Sale</a> in March 2006 to protect the <a href="2006%20Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a>, which were being held in Melbourne. In September 2007, Hornets patrolled over Sydney during the <a href="APEC%20Australia%202007">APEC leaders meeting</a> there. Eight Hornets were also deployed from Williamstown to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">RAAF Base Pearce</a> in October 2011 to protect the CHOGM meeting in nearby <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>. On 16 and 17 November that year, Hornets operated over Canberra and Darwin while President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> was present.

In March 2015 six F/A-18As from No. 75 Squadron were deployed to the Middle East as part of <a href="Operation%20Okra">Operation Okra</a>, replacing a detachment of Super Hornets. No. 81 Wing's involvement in Operation Okra concluded in May 2017, with No. 1 Squadron resuming responsibility for this task. By this time all of the wing's three squadrons had completed at least one rotation to the Middle East: No. 3 Squadron was deployed once, and the other two squadrons conducted two deployments. The squadrons used a common 'pool' of aircraft during these deployments, with either six or seven Hornets being stationed in the Middle East at any time. The aircraft were typically deployed for eight months before rotating back to Australia when becoming due for major servicing. Members of the three Hornet-equipped squadrons served five or six month rotations, and ground crew from 2OCU and No. 81 Wing's workshops were also deployed to fill specialist roles. The Hornets attacked <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIL</a> personnel and facilities in both Iraq and Syria, including in support of Iraqi forces engaged in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mosul%20%282016%E2%80%93present%29">Battle of Mosul</a>. Overall, No. 81 Wing conducted 1,973 sorties over Iraq and Syria during which 1,961 munitions were released. Despite the age of the aircraft and the harsh environmental conditions in the Middle East, the detachment sustained a very high serviceability rate.

While the Hornet Upgrade Program has been successful, the RAAF's Hornets are approaching retirement. It is expected that the aircraft will be increasingly expensive to operate as they age, and improvements to the fighter aircraft and air defences operated by other countries will reduce the Hornets' combat effectiveness. The Australian Government is currently planning to replace the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets with <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II</a> fighters from 2018 onwards. The <a href="Defence%20Materiel%20Organisation">Defence Materiel Organisation</a>'s Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B specifies that 72 F-35A fighters will be acquired to equip three squadrons and an operational training unit. No. 3 Squadron will be the first Hornet unit to be reequipped, and ceased operating the type in December 2017. It began to transition to the F-35 in early 2018. The squadron's Hornets and most of its personnel were transferred to No. 77 Squadron, which was expanded from two to three flights as part of this change. All of the F/A-18A and Bs are scheduled to be retired by 2023. The RAAF's Hornet sustainability planning has been designed to allow the type to be retained in service for longer if the F-35 program experiences further delays.

In the meantime, the RAAF has implemented several measures to keep the Hornets in service. These include a structural refurbishment program, increased monitoring of <a href="Fatigue%20%28material%29">fatigue</a>-related issues as well as repainting the aircraft and frequently washing them to reduce the risks posed by corrosion. In 2015 the <a href="Defence%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Group">Defence Science and Technology Group</a> conducted new statistical analysis of the Hornets' structural condition which found that the airframes were less fatigued than previously believed, and so able to remain in service for a longer period than planned if necessary. This finding was accepted by the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness – Australian Defence Force. As of September 2017, none of the RAAF Hornets were subject to flying restrictions due to airframe fatigue. However, the cost of maintaining the ageing aircraft in service has been increasing. A 2017 article by Canadian defence analyst Christopher Cowan and <a href="Australian%20Strategic%20Policy%20Institute">Australian Strategic Policy Institute</a> analyst Dr. Andrew Davies stated that the RAAF "has done an excellent job managing its Hornet fleet", with each aircraft having a unique plan to minimise airframe fatigue. At this time each of the Hornets had, on average, been flown for 4,200 hours, as compared to the nominal fatigue life of 6,000 hours for the type.

The Australian Government is planning to sell the Hornets and associated spare parts after the type is retired from RAAF service. In August 2017 the Canadian Government initiated discussions to purchase a number of Australian F/A-18s to augment the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force's</a> fleet of similar <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20CF-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet</a>s in the event that a planned purchase of Super Hornets was cancelled as the result of <a href="CSeries%20dumping%20petition%20by%20Boeing">a trade dispute</a>. A Canadian delegation also visited Australia that month to inspect RAAF Hornets. The Canadian Government lodged a formal expression of interest to purchase Australian F/A-18s on 29 September 2017.

On 13 December 2017, Australian Minister for Defence <a href="Marise%20Payne">Marise Payne</a> confirmed the sale of 18 F/A-18 Hornets and associated spare parts to Canada. The Canadian Government announced at the same time that it had cancelled its plans to acquire Super Hornets. The Australian aircraft are being acquired to enable the RCAF to continue to meet its international commitments until a new fighter type is ordered and enters service. In June 2018 the Canadian Government requested a further seven Australian Hornets. These additional aircraft will be used as a source of spare parts. The sale of the 25 Hornets was finalised in early 2019, with the purchase price being C$90 million. Of these aircraft, 18 will be issued to operational units and the remainder used for trials purposes and as a source of spare parts. After they arrive in Canada, the aircraft will be fitted with different <a href="ejection%20seat">ejection seat</a>s and software so that they are identical to CF-18s.

Deliveries of ex-RAAF Hornets to Canada began in February 2019. Two of the aircraft were flown to <a href="CFB%20Cold%20Lake">CFB Cold Lake</a> by Australian pilots in mid-February, and handed over after they had formed part of the RAAF contingent at a Red Flag exercise in the United States. At this time, deliveries of the other 23 Hornets were scheduled to be completed in 2021. However, this schedule is dependent on progress with introducing the F-35 into Australian service.

Oerip Soemohardjo

Oerip Soemohardjo (; <a href="Perfected%20Spelling%20System">Perfected Spelling</a>: Urip Sumoharjo, 22 February 1893 – 17 November 1948) was an Indonesian general and the first chief of staff of the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Armed%20Forces">Indonesian National Armed Forces</a>. He received several awards from the Indonesian government, including the title <a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Indonesia">National Hero of Indonesia</a> in 1964.

Born in <a href="Purworejo">Purworejo</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, Oerip exhibited leadership skills from an early age. As his parents wanted him to become a <a href="Bupati">regent</a>, after elementary school Oerip was sent to the School for Native Government Employees in <a href="Magelang">Magelang</a>. His mother died during his second year at the school, and Oerip left to undertake military training in <a href="Meester%20Cornelis">Meester Cornelis</a>, <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta). Upon graduating in 1914, he became a lieutenant in the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20East%20Indies%20Army">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a>; during almost 25 years of service he was stationed on three different islands and promoted several times, eventually becoming the highest-ranking <a href="Native%20Indonesians">Native</a> officer in the country.

Oerip resigned from his position in about 1938 after a disagreement with the regent of Purworejo, where he had been stationed. He and his wife Rohmah then moved to a village near <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, where they established a large garden and villa. After <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Netherlands">invaded the Netherlands</a> in May 1940 Oerip was recalled to active duty. When the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">occupied the Indies</a> less than two years later, Oerip was arrested and detained in a prisoner-of-war camp for three and a half months. He spent the rest of the occupation at his villa.

On 14 October 1945, several months after <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">Indonesia proclaimed its independence</a>, Oerip was declared the chief of staff and interim leader of the newly formed army. Working to build a united force from the fractured former military groups in the country, Oerip received little oversight owing to irregularities in the <a href="command%20hierarchy">chain of command</a>. On 12 November 1945 General <a href="Sudirman">Sudirman</a> was selected as leader of the armed forces, while Oerip remained as chief of staff. The two oversaw almost three years of development during the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>, until Oerip resigned in early 1948 because of the political leadership's lack of trust in the army. His health deteriorated; he was already suffering from a weak heart, and he died of a heart attack a few months later. He was posthumously promoted to full general. 
Oerip Soemohardjo was born Moehammad Sidik ("Little <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>") in his family's home in <a href="Sindurjan">Sindurjan</a>, <a href="Purworejo">Purworejo</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (a colony of the Netherlands), on 22 February 1893. He was the first son born to Soemohardjo, a headmaster and son of a local <a href="Muslim%20leader">Muslim leader</a>, and his wife, the daughter of Raden Tumenggung Widjojokoesoemo, the regent of <a href="Trenggalek">Trenggalek</a>; the family later had two more sons, Iskandar and Soekirno, as well as three daughters. The boys were raised partly by servants, and at a young age Sidik began showing leadership qualities, commanding groups of neighbourhood children in fishing and games of <a href="association%20football">football</a>. The brothers attended the school for <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a> headed by their father, and as a result received special treatment; this led to them becoming complacent and frequently misbehaving.

In his second year of school, Sidik fell from a <a href="Aleurites%20moluccanus">candlenut</a> tree and lost consciousness. After he awoke, his mother sent a letter to Widjojokoesoemo, who decided that Sidik's name was the cause of his misbehaviour. In reply, Widjojokoesoemo wrote that Sidik should be renamed Oerip, which means "alive". When he recovered fully, his family decided that the newly renamed Oerip – who continued to misbehave – should study at the local Dutch School for Girls (); the schools for boys were full and they hoped that the girls' school would improve Oerip's skill in Dutch, the language of the regime, as well as his temperament. After a year in the girls' school, in which Oerip became calmer, he was sent to a Dutch-run school for boys. However, his academic results continued to be poor. Beginning in his final year of elementary school, he often visited his friend's father, an ex-soldier who had served in <a href="Aceh">Aceh</a> for twenty years, to listen to the old man's stories, which inspired Oerip to join the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20East%20Indies%20Army">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a> (, or KNIL).

After passing an exam for would-be state employees and several months of preparations, Oerip moved to <a href="Magelang">Magelang</a> in 1908 to attend the School for Native Government Employees (, or OSVIA); his parents intended for him to become a regent like his grandfather. The following year his brothers joined him. After his mother died in 1909, Oerip sank into a months-long bout of depression and became withdrawn.

After finishing the year at OSVIA, he decided to enrol at the military academy in <a href="Meester%20Cornelis">Meester Cornelis</a>, <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta). He went there directly from Magelang, and told his brothers to inform their father, who disapproved of his son's choice. Soemohardjo initially attempted to bribe his son with 1,000 <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20gulden">gulden</a> to return to OSVIA, but eventually agreed to pay for Oerip's tuition. After his training, during which he found military life enjoyable, Oerip graduated from the academy in October 1914 and became a second lieutenant in the KNIL.

After several days visiting his father in Purworejo, Oerip returned to Meester Cornelis where he took up a posting to Battalion XII. Even though he was the smallest man in the unit and the only <a href="native%20Indonesian">native</a>, he was placed in a position of leadership. A year and half later he was sent to <a href="Banjarmasin">Banjarmasin</a>, <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. After a period patrolling the jungles outside Puruk Cahu and Muara Tewe, he was sent to Tanah Grogot, followed by <a href="Balikpapan">Balikpapan</a>. While stationed there Oerip was promoted to first lieutenant but faced discrimination as a native in the Dutch forces. In Banjarmasin he had convinced his commander to strike an ordinance forbidding non-Dutch officers from joining the football team, and by 1917 Oerip had received equal legal status with Dutch officers. After Balikpapan Oerip was further sent to <a href="Samarinda">Samarinda</a>, <a href="Tarakan%2C%20East%20Kalimantan">Tarakan</a>, and ultimately <a href="Malinau">Malinau</a>.

In Malinau, Oerip patrolled the border between the Dutch East Indies and the British-controlled <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sarawak">Kingdom of Sarawak</a> (part of modern-day Malaysia); he also worked to prevent conflicts and <a href="headhunting">headhunting</a> among <a href="Dayak%20people">Dayak</a> tribes. One day, seven years after arriving in Borneo, Oerip returned from patrol to find his home had been burned down. Upon the recommendation of a passing doctor, Oerip went back to Java, via Tarakan and <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, to <a href="Cimahi">Cimahi</a>, where he spent several months in recovery from fatigue.

Fully recovered, in 1923 Oerip was stationed in his hometown, Purworejo. In September 1925 Oerip was transferred to Magelang to serve in the (Foot Marshalry), a <a href="gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a>. Initially known to avoid women and under pressure to marry quickly, in Magelang Oerip became involved with Rohmah Soebroto, the daughter of his former <a href="Javanese%20language">Javanese</a> and <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> language teacher Soebroto and a distant relative of female emancipation figure <a href="Kartini">Kartini</a>. The pair were engaged on 7 May 1926 and married on 30 June of the same year. Also in Magelang, Oerip took on his <a href="Patronymic">father's name</a>, which he used as a family name for dealing with the Dutch. Afterwards he began referring to himself by the full name of Oerip Soemohardjo, although others continued to call him Oerip.

The year after his marriage, Oerip and his wife were stationed in <a href="Ambarawa">Ambarawa</a>, where Oerip was tasked with rebuilding a previously disbanded unit. While training local recruits in place of the Dutch commander who had yet to arrive, Oerip was promoted to captain. After the Dutch commander arrived, in July 1928 Oerip was given a year's leave, which he used to travel throughout Europe on a sightseeing trip with his wife. Upon his return to the Indies, he was stationed at Meester Cornelis.

In Meester Cornelis, Oerip began running training exercises; while stationed in Batavia, his father died. In 1933, he was sent to <a href="Padang%20Panjang">Padang Panjang</a> in <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> to deal with unrest that had already killed several Dutch officers. His time in Padang Panjang passed uneventfully, and in July 1935 he was given leave to go to Europe again. He was also promoted to major at that time, which made him the highest-ranking native officer in the KNIL. The following year, upon his return to the Indies, he was stationed in Purworejo. In mid-1938, after a disagreement with the local regent, Oerip was told to transfer to <a href="Gombong">Gombong</a>; he refused, then left the KNIL and moved to his parents-in-law's home in <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>.

In Yogyakarta, the unemployed Oerip took up <a href="orchid">orchid</a> gardening. Soon after arriving, he and his wife bought a villa in Gentan, north of the city. Although the villa was small, the couple used its of land to open a large flower garden, with their income subsidised by Oerip's pension from the KNIL. At his villa, named KEM (for , or "Purity and Bravery"), Oerip often received guests, both military and civilian, from whom he received information about current events and to whom he gave advice regarding military matters and politics. In 1940, the pair adopted a four-year-old Dutch girl named Abby from an orphanage in <a href="Semarang">Semarang</a>.

Shortly thereafter, on 10 May 1940, when <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Netherlands">invaded the Netherlands</a>, Oerip was recalled to active service. Three days after reporting to Colonel Pik in Magelang, he went to the KNIL headquarters in <a href="Bandung">Bandung</a>, where he was the first retired officer to report. Afterwards, he and his family – who had joined him – were transferred to Cimahi, where Oerip was tasked with establishing a new battalion depot. Several native officers were stationed in northern parts of the Indies during 1941 in preparation for an expected attack by the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>, although Oerip stayed in Cimahi.

After the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupied the Indies</a> in early 1942, Oerip was held in a mixed <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> camp in Cimahi. Upon his release three and a half months later, Oerip refused an offer to form a new, Japanese-backed police force and returned to KEM, where he and his wife rented <a href="paddy%20field">paddy field</a>s to grow rice while continuing to operate their flower garden. To protect their land, they surrounded their property and home with a high bamboo fence. Although no longer active in the military, Oerip occasionally received former KNIL members, including <a href="Abdul%20Haris%20Nasution">Abdul Haris Nasution</a> and Sunarmo, who brought news of events outside the village. The couple continued their work, harassed and surveilled by the Japanese and pro-Japanese Indonesians, until the <a href="bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> in early August 1945 signified that Japan would soon withdraw. It was during this period that Oerip began having heart problems.

After the <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">Proclamation of Indonesian Independence</a> on 17 August 1945, Oerip and his family left KEM for Rohma's parents' home in Yogyakarta. When the People's Safety Body (, or BKR) was formed on 23 August, Oerip led a group of military commanders who petitioned for it to be set up as a national military formation; a separate group, led by politician <a href="Oto%20Iskandar%20di%20Nata">Oto Iskandar di Nata</a>, wanted the BKR to fulfil the functions of a police organisation. The political leadership, consisting of <a href="President%20of%20Indonesia">President</a> <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a> and <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Indonesia">Vice President</a> <a href="Mohammad%20Hatta">Mohammad Hatta</a>, agreed to a compromise: it became a police-style organisation, but most of its members had served in the military, either with the <a href="Pembela%20Tanah%20Air">Defenders of the Homeland</a> (, or PETA) or the Heihō.

On 14 October 1945 – nine days after the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Armed%20Forces">Indonesian National Armed Forces</a> was formally established – Oerip was declared its Chief of Staff and interim leader, and left immediately for Jakarta. In a cabinet meeting the following day, he was ordered to build a national army, headquartered in Yogyakarta, in preparation for an expected assault by Dutch troops coming to reclaim the Indies. He departed for Yogyakarta on 16 October, and arrived the following day. He first established the headquarters in a room at Hotel Merdeka, which he used until the Sultan of Yogyakarta <a href="Hamengkubuwono%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIX">Hamengkubuwono IX</a> donated land and a building for the army to use.

With the BKR scattered under independent leadership throughout the country, the newly formed People's Security Army ( or TKR, now known as the ) drew officers mainly from the native members of the former KNIL. However, these officers were poorly received by Indonesian nationalists, who viewed them as mercenaries for having served in the Dutch forces. Meanwhile, <a href="wikt%3Arank%20and%20file">rank and file</a> members of the TKR were drawn from numerous groups, including former PETA, current Pemuda (young Indonesian revolutionaries), and the BKR. Although Oerip set out a command structure, in reality the army's hierarchy was provisional and depended heavily on the strength of local units.

Following a government decree on 20 October Oerip became subordinate to both the acting Minister of Defence Soeljoadikoesoemo and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces <a href="Soeprijadi">Soeprijadi</a>. However, neither man showed up to assume his duties. Soeprijadi, a PETA soldier who had led an uprising against Japanese forces in <a href="Blitar">Blitar</a> in February 1945, was thought dead. While Soeljohadikosomo's position remained unfilled, the guerrilla leader <a href="Moestopo">Moestopo</a> declared himself Minister of Defence. As such, Oerip had little oversight and felt pressured to quickly establish a stable command structure. On 2 November, he appointed leaders for military operations in various parts of the country: Didi Kartasasmita for western Java, Soeratman for central Java, Mohammad for eastern Java, and Soehardjo Hardjowardojo for Sumatra; each of these sub-commanders was given the rank of major general. Oerip also began appropriating weapons to different TKR commands. He took confiscated Japanese weapons from well-equipped forces and distributed them as needed. However, the results were less successful than he had hoped. PETA had been organised locally during the Japanese occupation, and as such its members were unable to accept a centralised leadership.
On 12 November 1945, at the first general meeting of army leadership, General <a href="Sudirman">Sudirman</a> – the leader of the Fifth Division in <a href="Purwokerto">Purwokerto</a>, who had two years military experience and was 23 years younger than Oerip – was elected leader of the army following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21 votes to Sudirman's 22. Divisional commanders from Sumatra, who had voted unanimously, swayed the vote in Sudirman's favour; Oerip had lost votes because some of the division leaders distrusted his history with the KNIL and the oath he had taken to the Dutch motherland upon graduation. Although Sudirman was surprised at his selection and offered to surrender the leadership position to Oerip, the meeting did not allow it; Oerip himself was glad to no longer be in charge of the army. Sudirman kept Oerip, by then a lieutenant general, to serve as chief of staff under him. While Sudirman remained unconfirmed, Oerip remained "de jure" leader; however, the Indonesian journalist Salim Said writes that Oerip's orders were at times unintelligible owing to the leader's poor command of Indonesian and often ignored unless approved by Sudirman.

When General Sudirman was approved on 18 December, he began working to consolidate and unite the army. Meanwhile, Oerip handled day-to-day organisational and technical issues. Many of the details, such as company uniforms, he left to regional commanders. However, to deal with more important issues, such as establishing a <a href="military%20police">military police</a> and preventing enemy <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a>s from landing, he passed edicts that applied nationally.

Together, Sudirman and Oerip were able to address many of the differences between former KNIL and PETA troops. The government also renamed the army twice in January 1946, first to the People's Safety Army (), then to the Republic of Indonesia Military Forces(, or TRI). On 23 February 1946, Oerip was appointed head of the 11-member Committee to Reorganise the Army (), formed by presidential decree. After four months of discussion, on 17 May the committee gave its recommendations to Sukarno. Oerip was set to handle day-to-day operations of a downsized army, while the Ministry of Defence was given greater bureaucratic power. Sudirman was kept as commander of the young armed forces.

As Minister of Defence <a href="Amir%20Sjarifuddin">Amir Sjarifuddin</a> began establishing pro-leftist groups within the military, Oerip became distrustful of the political leadership and vehemently decried the government's attempts to use soldiers' political affiliations to control the military. Still, he and Sudirman continued to work to ensure that <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> troops (), which had arisen from the general populace, were included in the military. This was realised on 3 June 1947, when the government declared the union of the laskar and TRI into a new military organisation, the Indonesian National Armed Forces (, or TNI). Meanwhile, Oerip established a <a href="military%20academy">military academy</a> in Yogyakarta.
To meet the Dutch threat, Oerip intended to attack while the former colonists were still consolidating their forces, a plan that was quashed by the government's attempts at diplomacy. He preferred guerrilla tactics to formal military conflicts, once telling a subordinate that the best attack would be one with a hundred snipers hidden behind enemy lines. Oerip was strongly against the <a href="Renville%20Agreement">Renville Agreement</a>, an ultimately unsuccessful treaty that led to the withdrawal of 35,000 troops from western Java and the formalisation of the <a href="Van%20Mook%20Line">Van Mook Line</a> between Dutch and Indonesian forces. He saw the agreement, ratified on 17 January 1948, as a stalling tactic, giving the Dutch the chance to strengthen their forces. Meanwhile, Amir Sjarifuddin – by then also serving as prime minister – began culling the army, predominantly keeping leftist-leaning troops. Disgusted with what he perceived as the government's lack of trust in the military, Oerip tendered his resignation, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Minister of Defence, Vice President Hatta.

After several months of growing steadily weaker and undergoing treatment from Dr Sim Ki Ay, on the evening of 17 November 1948 Oerip collapsed and died from a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> in his room in Yogyakarta. After a night-long <a href="Viewing%20%28funeral%29">viewing</a> he was buried the next day in <a href="Kusumanegara%20Heroes%27%20Cemetery">Semaki Heroes' Cemetery</a> and posthumously promoted to general. When Sudirman threatened to resign in 1949, he blamed Oerip's death – as well as his own <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> – on the government's inconsistency during the revolution. Oerip was survived by his wife and adopted daughter. Abby died of malaria in January 1951, and Rohmah died on 29 October 1977 in Semarang; she was buried in <a href="Ungaran">Ungaran</a>.

Oerip received numerous <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Indonesia">awards from the national government</a> posthumously, including the Bintang Sakti (1959), Bintang Mahaputera (1960), Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipurna (1967), and Bintang Kartika Eka Pakçi Utama (1968). On 10 December 1964 he was declared a <a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Indonesia">National Hero of Indonesia</a> through Presidential Decree 314 of 1964. Sudirman was also declared a National Hero by the same decree.

On 22 February 1964 the Indonesian military academy in Magelang dedicated a memorial to him, which described the military leader as "a son of Indonesia who valued work over words, who prioritised his Duty over his wants." The academy's Catholic chapel also includes a dedication to him from 1965, prompted by a discussion between Rohmah and a missionary friend of hers. Several streets are named after Oerip, including in his hometown of Purworejo, nearby Yogyakarta, and the capital at Jakarta.

Ruma Maida

Ruma Maida (released internationally as Maida's House) is a 2009 Indonesian film written by <a href="Ayu%20Utami">Ayu Utami</a>, directed by <a href="Teddy%20Soeriaatmadja">Teddy Soeriaatmadja</a> and starring <a href="Atiqah%20Hasiholan">Atiqah Hasiholan</a>, , <a href="Nino%20Fernandez">Nino Fernandez</a>, and <a href="Frans%20Tumbuan">Frans Tumbuan</a>. It details a woman's struggle to save a historic house from a developer; it also shows the life of the house's original owner.

Work on what was to become "Ruma Maida" began in 2008, when Utami was approached by Lamp Pictures and asked to write a nationalism-themed script; she completed the task in six months, with input from Soeriaatmadja. After three months of <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a>, shooting began in <a href="Semarang">Semarang</a>, <a href="Central%20Java">Central Java</a>, and <a href="Kota%2C%20Jakarta">Kota, Jakarta</a>. Editing took three months, after which the film – with a soundtrack by the band <a href="Naif%20%28band%29">Naif</a> and a song written by Utami – premiered on 28 October 2009, the anniversary of the 1928 <a href="Youth%20Pledge">Youth Pledge</a>; it was later shown in film festivals in Singapore, Australia, and Italy.

"Ruma Maida", which uses different filming styles for scenes in the past and present, deals with the importance of education, history, and pluralism. Critical reception to the film was mixed; reviewers praised the visuals but disapproved of the plot and dialogue. It was nominated for twelve Citra Awards at the 2009 <a href="Indonesian%20Film%20Festival">Indonesian Film Festival</a>, of which it won one.

A young history student, Maida (<a href="Atiqah%20Hasiholan">Atiqah Hasiholan</a>), a Christian, runs a free school for <a href="street%20children">street children</a> in Jakarta. The school is in a house that once belonged to Ishak Pahing (<a href="Nino%20Fernandez">Nino Fernandez</a>), a Christian <a href="Indo%20people">Indo</a> composer and pilot, and his Muslim wife Nani Kuddus (Imelda Soraya); Pahing wrote the song "Pulau Tenggara" ("The South-Eastern Island"), which inspired President <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a> to help form the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>, while living in the house. As Maida learns about Pahing, she decides to write her undergraduate thesis about his life.

One day her class is interrupted by the young Muslim architect Sakera (Yama Carlos), who has been told to evict Maida's school by his employer, the developer Dasaad Muchlisin (<a href="Frans%20Tumbuan">Frans Tumbuan</a>). As Maida and Sakera argue in the streets, <a href="May%201998%20riots%20of%20Indonesia">rioting</a> breaks out around them. Sakera protects the half-<a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">Chinese</a> Maida, then tells her that he will help her keep the house, although it is scheduled to be demolished within a week.

After attempts to persuade Muchlisin to keep the original design fail, Sakera overhears that the house is on disputed land. Maida uses the information, as well as feedback from a <a href="kroncong">traditional musical</a> group distantly related to Pahing, to discover that the house has a secret underground bunker, in which she and Sakera – with whom she has begun to fall in love – find documents showing the history of the house. With the help of her mother's former lover Kuan (Henky Solaiman), she discovers the true ownership of the house.

Pahing, who had grown up within the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Awakening">nascent independence movement</a> and associated with several historical figures, was arrested for being half-Dutch by the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese spy</a> Maruyama (Verdi Solaiman) – a man who coveted Pahing's wife. After being tortured, Pahing was released to discover that his wife had been raped and killed; their newborn son Fajar had been kidnapped. Pahing later died on <a href="Dakota%20VT-CLA">a flight</a> carrying medical supplies over <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a> when the flight was shot down. Meanwhile, his son was raised by Maruyama – the kidnapper – and had his name changed to Dasaad Muchlisin.

With this information, Maida, Sakera, and Kuan approach Muchlisin and tell him how the house features in his history. After a short silence, Muchlisin tells them to leave. Several months later, on Maida and Sakera's wedding day – when they are married at both a mosque and a church – Muchlisin comes to the church and says that he has abandoned his plans to demolish the house. Instead, he renovates the building and dedicates it as a school for street children.


The screenplay for "Ruma Maida" was written by <a href="Ayu%20Utami">Ayu Utami</a>, her first such work; mainly known for her novels, she had avoided screenplays as she thought they were generally too commercially oriented. She wrote the screenplay over a period of six months beginning in 2008, when Lamp Pictures  – which produced the film with Karuna Pictures – requested that she write a story about nationalism; according to the director <a href="Teddy%20Soeriaatmadja">Teddy Soeriaatmadja</a>, who was brought in while the screenplay was still on its first draft, he and Utami read seven drafts of the screenplay before they agreed on the story. Considering the screenplay a way to encourage the younger generation to study <a href="Indonesian%20history">Indonesian history</a>, which she said could be fun, Utami decided to focus on education, diversity, and history.

<a href="Pre-production">Pre-production</a> for "Ruma Maida" took three months. The characters were written without any particular actors in mind. Atiqah Hasiholan, who had previously starred in the <a href="List%20of%20Indonesian%20submissions%20for%20the%20Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award-submitted</a> "<a href="Jamila%20dan%20Sang%20Presiden">Jamila dan Sang Presiden</a>" ("Jamila and the President", 2009), was cast as Maida. Yama Carlos, who played Sakera, was initially cast for another role but received the leading male role after a last-minute switch. The actor cast as Muchlisin, Frans Tumbuan, was the only one auditioned as Soeriaatmadja thought the role was perfect for him. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that, including <a href="Extra%20%28actor%29">extras</a>, "Ruma Maida" had the largest cast of any film he had made to that point.

Shooting for the film was conducted in <a href="Kota%2C%20Jakarta">Kota, Jakarta</a>, and <a href="Semarang">Semarang</a>, <a href="Central%20Java">Central Java</a>, over a period of one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, <a href="cinematography">cinematographer</a> Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.

The Indonesian band <a href="Naif%20%28band%29">Naif</a> <a href="cover%20%28music%29">covered</a> several songs for "Ruma Maida"'s soundtrack, including songs from the 1940s such as "Juwita Malam" ("Beauty of the Night", by <a href="Ismail%20Marzuki">Ismail Marzuki</a>), "Di Bawah Sinar Bulan Purnama" ("Under the Light of the Full Moon", by <a href="R.%20Maladi">R. Maladi</a>), and "<a href="Ibu%20Pertiwi%20%28song%29">Ibu Pertiwi</a>" ("Motherland"). The covers were recorded over a period of five days. Utami wrote "Pulau Tenggara", which was sung by Imelda Soraya.

Benny Benke, writing in "<a href="Suara%20Merdeka">Suara Merdeka</a>", noted that the film was a "free interpretation of the formal Indonesian history, [a history] which is too arrogant, dominant, and dogmatic". He wrote that at times the line between fact and fiction was thin. Utami stated that people from the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">revolutionary period</a> "believed in dreams" and had a "strong sense of heroism and patriotism", things which she believed Indonesia needed. Soeriaatmadja also noted that the film was meant to address issues of contemporary Indonesia, through the house's history. Assistant director Azhar Lubis described the house as a <a href="wikt%3Amicrocosm">microcosm</a> of Indonesia, implying that, if the country was not maintained, it would fall apart.

In "<a href="Media%20Indonesia">Media Indonesia</a>", Yulia Permata Sari wrote that Soeriaatmadja seemed to be promoting the need to remember and respect history through the plot and characterisations. The film showed "<a href="Indonesia%20Raya">Indonesia Raya</a>" composer <a href="W.R.%20Supratman">W.R. Supratman</a>, Japanese admiral Maeda, Vice President <a href="Mohammad%20Hatta">Mohammad Hatta</a>, President Sukarno, and Prime Minister <a href="Sutan%20Sjahrir">Sutan Sjahrir</a>. Hasiholan considered the film a warning against repeating past mistakes.

Triwik Kurniasari, writing in "<a href="The%20Jakarta%20Post">The Jakarta Post</a>", described the inclusion of the May 1998 riots and subsequent <a href="fall%20of%20Suharto">fall of Suharto</a> as touching on pluralism issues. Utami, in an interview with the "<a href="Jakarta%20Globe">Jakarta Globe</a>", stated that she had meant to show diversity by giving the characters different ethnic, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds, and later explained that the film was meant to show Indonesia's motto <a href="Bhinneka%20Tunggal%20Ika">Bhinneka Tunggal Ika</a> (Unity in Diversity) as it is applied in the country. Another reviewer, Dewi Anggraeni, wrote that "Ruma Maida" "paints a more realistic picture of Indonesia’s society, where people do not necessarily fit into neat social, racial or economic categories", with its characters not fitting into any traditional stereotypes.

"Ruma Maida" uses colours and shooting styles to indicate different time periods. Past events have a soft sepia overlay and are shot with a static camera, while those in 1998 have more natural tones and are shot with a handheld. The use of the handheld was meant to show the present in as "rough and non-sterile" a manner possible, while the past was meant to have a sweet, beautiful, and clean feeling; this played on the theme of romanticising the past. Events in Pahing's life are shown in <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> interspersed throughout Maida's struggle to retake the house. The film is paced slowly, and shots are taken from "unique" angles.

In <a href="Tempo%20%28Indonesian%20magazine%29">"Tempo" magazine</a>, Kurie Suditomo wrote that "Ruma Maida" intertwined several sub-plots, including the depiction of the 1928 Youth Conference, the education of street children, and a scene where Sakera discusses architecture with Muchlisin; the review stated that these detracted from the film's comprehensibility. "Jakarta Globe" reviewer Armando Siahaan noted that several plot lines run parallel, including riots following the <a href="Japanese%20surrender">Japanese surrender</a> in 1945 and those in May 1998.

"Ruma Maida" premiered on 28 October 2009, coinciding with events that celebrated the 1928 <a href="Youth%20Pledge">Youth Pledge</a> – this release date was planned from early in production, because of the date's historical significance. It received a wide release on the following day. The film was screened at the <a href="Singapore%20International%20Film%20Festival">Singapore International Film Festival</a> in April 2010. That August "Ruma Maida" had three screenings in the "Education" category of the Indonesian Film Festival in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia. In November it was screened at the Asiatica Film Mediale in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, Italy, under the title "La Casa Di Maida".

"Ruma Maida" received mixed reception. Kurniasari described the film as "an enjoyable way to learn more about [Indonesia's] long history." Benke wrote that the film had good visuals, but the dialogue at times "went over viewers' heads". Sari called the cinematography well done, but found that the plot could confuse viewers. Suditomo thought that the film was well visualised but lost much of its impact owing to its extraneous subplots.

Anggraeni, covering the Indonesian Film Festival in Australia, described "Ruma Maida" as cleverly weaving the plot into Indonesia's independence struggle, although she felt that several plot twists "rather stretch[ed] the audience's imagination". Siahaan wrote that the film "may have limitations in its execution and presentation, but is highly commendable for its ability to raise social questions and delve into the nation’s history." The review in "<a href="Republika%20%28Indonesian%20newspaper%29">Republika</a>" suggested that the film may be too boring for the general public owing to its slow-moving plot.

The film was released on VCD and DVD in Indonesia on 14 July 2010 by EZY Home Entertainment, after passing through the censorship board in February. The DVD featured English-language subtitles and a behind the scenes documentary.

"Ruma Maida" was nominated for twelve Citra Awards at the 2009 <a href="Indonesian%20Film%20Festival">Indonesian Film Festival</a>, winning one.

Look Mickey

Look Mickey (also known as Look Mickey!) is a 1961 oil on canvas painting by <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>. Widely regarded as the bridge between his <a href="abstract%20expressionism">abstract expressionism</a> and <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a> works, it is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value as well as being the first example of the artist's employment of <a href="Ben-Day%20dots">Ben-Day dots</a>, <a href="speech%20balloon">speech balloon</a>s and comic imagery as a source for a painting. The painting was bequeathed to the Washington, D.C., <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> upon Lichtenstein's death.

Building on his late 1950s drawings of <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a>s characters, "Look Mickey" marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of <a href="painterly">painterly</a> techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations of pop culture and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing to the work of artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and <a href="Donald%20Duck">Donald Duck</a> during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.

The work dates from Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition, and is regarded by art critics as revolutionary both as a progression of pop art and as a work of <a href="modern%20art">modern art</a> in general. It was later reproduced in his 1973 painting, "<a href="Artist%27s%20Studio%E2%80%94Look%20Mickey">Artist's Studio—Look Mickey</a>", which shows the painting hanging prominently on a facing wall of Lichtenstein's studio.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips into their work. Lichtenstein was among them, and in 1958 began to make drawings of comic strip characters. <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced "Look Mickey" and "Popeye" in 1961. Lichtenstein's 1961 works, especially "Look Mickey", are considered a minor step from his earlier comic strip pop art.
According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, "Look Mickey" was based on the <a href="Little%20Golden%20Book">Little Golden Book</a> series. The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is entitled "Donald Duck Lost and Found", written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through <a href="Disney%20Consumer%20Products">Disney Enterprises</a>. The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten. An alternative theory suggests that "Look Mickey" and "Popeye" were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers. This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein <a href="Cropping%20%28image%29">crop</a>ped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene.

A number of stories purport to tell of the moment of inspiration for "Look Mickey". Critic Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes that the artist recalled one of his sons pointing to a comic book and challenging; "I bet you can't paint as good as that". Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son's classmates who mocked Lichtenstein's hard-to-fathom abstracts. American painter <a href="Allan%20Kaprow">Allan Kaprow</a> once stated, in reference to a <a href="Bazooka%20%28chewing%20gum%29">Bazooka</a> <a href="Dubble%20Bubble">Dubble Bubble</a> Gum wrapper, to Lichtenstein, "You can't teach color from Cézanne, you can only teach it from something like this." Lichtenstein then showed him one of his Donald Duck images.

During the comic book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often slightly altered the colorization of the original source. According to Marco Livingstone, his early comic subjects comprise a "loose and improvised style clearly derived from <a href="Willem%20de%20Kooning">de Kooning</a>." Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning "Women"". When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the "<a href="Campbell%27s%20Soup%20Cans">Campbell's Soup Cans</a>" series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing. He once said "I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and <a href="James%20Rosenquist">James Rosenquist</a>, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol. Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like <a href="Popeye">Popeye</a> and <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>.

During autumn 1961, Allan Kaprow, a fellow teacher at <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a>, introduced Lichenstein to art dealer <a href="Ivan%20Karp">Ivan Karp</a>, the director of the Leo Castelli Gallery. Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings, but not "Look Mickey". He instead impressed him with "<a href="Girl%20with%20Ball">Girl with Ball</a>", and Karp decided to represent Lichtenstein a few weeks later.

The painting is one of Lichtenstein's first non-<a href="expressionist">expressionist</a> works, and marks his initial employment of <a href="Ben-Day%20dots">Ben-Day dots</a> which he used to give it an "industrial" half-tone effect. The painting is his first use both of a speech balloon and <a href="comics">comics</a> as source material. The work has visible pencil marks and was produced using a plastic-bristle dog brush to apply the oil paint onto the canvas. By the time of his death, "Look Mickey" was regarded as Lichtenstein's breakthrough work.

In reproducing a mass-produced illustration in a painterly style, Lichtenstein simplifies by reducing the composition to primary colors, which serves to accentuate its mass appeal and largely gives it the "pop" look. Typically, Ben-Day dots enable an artist to produce a variety of colors by using dots of a few colors to give the illusion of a broader palette. By mixing dots of different colors, like an ink jet printer, just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using only a limited number of primary hues. Lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this, achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues. Instead, for each color that he wanted to include in a work, he used that color paint.

Lichtenstein made several alterations to the original work: he eliminated various non-essential figures and rotated the dock so that Donald looks off the side rather than the end. At the same time, he kept Donald and Mickey in almost the same positions as they were in the original. Lichtenstein not only redesigned the space, but also altered the position of Donald's body and fishing rod for better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to form a meticulous composition. <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> said about Donald Duck: "He's got a big mouth, a big belligerent eye, a twistable neck and a substantial backside that's highly flexible. The duck comes near being the animator's ideal subject." Lichtenstein's painting reflects many of these physical features.

Compared to the original source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps <a href="schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a> towards Donald. The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misaligning the joining of the contours of the waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of <a href="white%20space%20%28visual%20arts%29">white space</a>.

The large scale reproduction of a comic strip frame was considered radical and revolutionary at the time. Critics applauded the work's playfulness, inherent humor and irreverence. According to Diane Waldman of the <a href="Solomon%20R.%20Guggenheim%20Museum">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a>, ""Look Mickey" is broad comedy and falls into the category of slapstick ..." In Lichtenstein's <a href="obituary">obituary</a>, "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" critic Christopher Knight described the work as "a slyly hilarious riff on Abstract Expressionism". Lichtenstein's slight alterations to its "linear clarity and colour", the critic writes, add to its aesthetic value and grandeur, reinforced by his choice of scale. A common misconception about Lichtenstein comes from the fact that in his best known works, his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons. Graham Bader wrote that "Lichtenstein's painting in fact appears more the product of industrial manufacture than the very pulp image on which it is based." "Look Mickey" is considered <a href="self-reference">self-referential</a> in the sense that the artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the artist.

Bader observes that "Look Mickey" is concerned both with the artistic process and Lichtenstein's new painting techniques. He believes it can be considered a self-portrait in the sense that it "explicitly situates the painting's maker himself within the self-enclosed narcissistic circuit at its center". The painting shows Donald looking into the reflective water at Lichtenstein's blue 'rfl' signature "as a kind of surrogate for the image's creator", in a manner that is reminiscent of <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a>'s "<a href="Narcissus%20%28Caravaggio%29">Narcissus</a>", in which the subject gazes at his own reflection on the water. This is viewed as an allegory of Lichtenstein's position as an artist trained to develop his <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realist</a> instincts despite the prominence of <a href="abstract%20expressionism">abstract expressionism</a>. When viewed this way, Mickey serves as the "vanguard <a href="Modern%20art">modernist</a>" <a href="superego">superego</a> towering over Lichtenstein and laughing at his retrograde efforts.

Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots to color Mickey's face. According to some art critics, this gives the character the appearance of <a href="blushing">blushing</a>. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or that it is the hue associated with a "healthy glow," since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur. Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others are quick to point out that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.
Graham Bader, describing it as the engine of the painting's narrative, notes the intrigue created by the juxtaposition of Donald's heightened sense of visual perception as it relates to his anticipated catch, and his deadened sense of tactile perception as it relates to having a fishing hook in the back of his own shirt. In this sense, Lichtenstein has chosen to depict a source that has as its subject a divide between raised visual awareness and an absent sense of touch:

Lichtenstein frequently explored vision-related themes after he began to work in the pop art genre; early examples include "<a href="I%20Can%20See%20the%20Whole%20Room...and%20There%27s%20Nobody%20in%20It%21">I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It!</a>" and "Look Mickey". In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope ("<a href="Torpedo...Los%21">Torpedo...Los!</a>"), a <a href="mirror">mirror</a> ("<a href="Girl%20in%20Mirror">Girl in Mirror</a>") or a <a href="peephole">peephole</a> ("I Can See the Whole Room ... and There's Nobody in It!"), "Look Mickey", with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.

The painting was included in Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition at The Leo Castelli Gallery, a show in which all the works had pre-sold before its opening in February 1962. The exhibition, which ran from February 10 through March 3, 1962, included "<a href="Engagement%20Ring%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Engagement Ring</a>", "<a href="Blam%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Blam</a>" and "The Refrigerator". He included the painting in his "<a href="Artist%27s%20Studio%E2%80%94Look%20Mickey">Artist's Studio—Look Mickey</a>" (1973), showing it hanging prominently on the wall of the pictorial space intended to depict his studio as the ideal studio, and implying that his popularity with critic and public ratifies his choice of popular culture subject matter. Reflecting on "Look Mickey" many years later, he said:

The painting was bequeathed to the Washington <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> after Lichtenstein's death in 1997, following a 1990 pledge in honor of the institution's 50th Anniversary. It remains in the gallery's collection, where, , it is on permanent view.

<a href="Harold%20Rosenberg">Harold Rosenberg</a> once described Lichtensteins reworking of the comics source as follows: "...the difference between a comic strip of Mickey Mouse and a Lichtenstein painting of the same was art history, or the fact that Lichtenstein paints with the idea of the museum in mind."

Drowning Girl

Drowning Girl (also known as Secret Hearts or I Don't Care! I'd Rather Sink) is a 1963 painting in oil and synthetic polymer paint on canvas by <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>. Using the conventions of <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> art, a <a href="speech%20balloon">thought bubble</a> conveys the thoughts of the figure, while <a href="Ben-Day%20dots">Ben-Day dots</a> echo the effect of the mechanized printing process. It is one of the most representative paintings of the <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a> movement, and part of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>'s permanent collection since 1971. The painting is considered among Lichtenstein's most significant works, perhaps on a par with his acclaimed 1963 diptych "<a href="Whaam%21">Whaam!</a>". "Drowning Girl" has been described as a "masterpiece of melodrama", and is one of the artist's earliest images depicting women in tragic situations, a theme to which he often returned in the mid-1960s.

The painting shows a teary-eyed woman on a turbulent sea. She is emotionally distressed, seemingly from a romance. A thought bubble reads: "I Don't Care! I'd Rather Sink — Than Call Brad For Help!" This narrative element highlights the clichéd <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>, while its graphics reiterate Lichtenstein's theme of <a href="painterly">painterly</a> work imitating mechanized reproduction. The work is derived from a 1962 <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> panel, while also borrowing from <a href="Hokusai">Hokusai</a>'s "<a href="The%20Great%20Wave%20off%20Kanagawa">The Great Wave off Kanagawa</a>" and from elements of modernist artists <a href="Jean%20Arp">Jean Arp</a> and <a href="Joan%20Mir%C3%B3">Joan Miró</a>. It is one of several Lichtenstein works that mention a character named Brad who is absent from the picture. Both the graphical and narrative elements of the work are cropped from the source image.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips. <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a> made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced "<a href="Look%20Mickey">Look Mickey</a>" and "Popeye" in 1961. Although Warhol had produced silkscreens of <a href="comic%20strips">comic strips</a> and of other <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a> subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to "<a href="Campbell%27s%20Soup%20Cans">Campbell's Soup Cans</a>" as a subject at the time to avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by Lichtenstein. He once said "I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and <a href="James%20Rosenquist">James Rosenquist</a>, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing."

"Drowning Girl" depicted the advancement of Lichtenstein's cartoon work, which represented his 1961 departure from his <a href="abstract%20expressionism">abstract expressionism</a> period, from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and wartime armed forces. Lichtenstein said that, at the time, "I was very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images." Lichtenstein parodied four Picassos between 1962 and 1963. Picasso's depictions of weeping women may have influenced Lichtenstein to produce portrayals of vulnerable teary-eyed women, such as the subjects of "<a href="Hopeless%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Hopeless</a>" and "Drowning Girl". Another possible influence on his emphasis on depicting distressed women in the early- to mid-1960s was that his first marriage was dissolving at the time. Lichtenstein's first marriage to Isabel Wilson, which resulted in two sons, lasted from 1949 to 1965; the couple separated in 1963.

When Lichtenstein made his transition to comic-based work, he began to mimic the style while adapting the subject matter. He applied simplified color schemes and commercial printing-like techniques. The style he adopted was "simple, well-framed images solid fields of bold color often bounded by thick, stark border lines." The borrowed technique was "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of Ben-Day dots used in newspaper printing". <a href="PBS">PBS</a> asserts that this is an adaptation of the <a href="ligne%20claire">ligne claire</a> style associated with <a href="Herg%C3%A9">Hergé</a>. Lichtenstein once said of his technique: "I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental."

The subject of "Drowning Girl" is an example of Lichtenstein's post-1963 comics-based women who "look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup." In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein produced several "fantasy drama" paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing women to be miserable, such as "Drowning Girl", "Hopeless" and "<a href="In%20the%20Car">In the Car</a>". These works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent "girls next door" in a variety of tenuous emotional states. "In "Hopeless" and "Drowning Girl", for example, the heroines appear as victims of unhappy love affairs, with one displaying helplessness ... and the other defiance (she would rather drown than ask for her lover's help)." "Drowning Girl", the aforementioned works and "<a href="Oh%2C%20Jeff...I%20Love%20You%2C%20Too...But...">Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But...</a>" are among those tragedies that make the author a popular draw at museums.

"Drowning Girl" is derived from the <a href="splash%20page%20%28comics%29">splash page</a> from "Run for Love!", illustrated by Tony Abruzzo and lettered by <a href="Ira%20Schnapp">Ira Schnapp</a>, in "Secret Hearts" #83 (November 1962), <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>. This is the same comic book issue that inspired "Hopeless".

In 1963, Lichtenstein was parodying various types of sources such as commercial illustrations, comic imagery and even modern masterpieces. The masterpieces represented what could have been dubbed the "canon" of art and was thought of as "high art," while the "low-art" subject matter included comic strip images. His masterworks sources included the likes of <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a>, <a href="Piet%20Mondrian">Mondrian</a> and <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a>. During this time in his career, Lichtenstein noted that "the things that I have apparently parodied I actually admire." At the time, Lichtenstein was exploring the theme of "industrialization of emotion". In Lichtenstein's obituary, "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" critic <a href="Christopher%20Knight%20%28art%20critic%29">Christopher Knight</a> said the work was "a witty rejoinder to <a href="Willem%20de%20Kooning">De Kooning</a>'s famously brushy paintings of women". His comic romances often depicted stereotypical representations of thwarted passions. Although the Lichtenstein Foundation website claims that Lichtenstein did not begin using his <a href="opaque%20projector">opaque projector</a> technique until the fall of 1963, Lichtenstein described his process for producing comics based art, including "Drowning Girl":
When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at the <a href="Leo%20Castelli%20Gallery">Leo Castelli Gallery</a> in New York City in February 1962, it sold out before the opening. In addition to "Drowning Girl", the exhibition included "Look Mickey", "<a href="Engagement%20Ring%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Engagement Ring</a>", "<a href="Blam%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Blam</a>" and "The Refrigerator". The show ran from February 10 through March 3, 1962. According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, "Drowning Girl" was part of Lichtenstein's first exhibition at <a href="Ferus%20Gallery">Ferus Gallery</a> in Los Angeles from April 1 – April 27, 1963, featuring "<a href="Masterpiece%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Masterpiece</a>", "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Madame%20C%C3%A9zanne%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Portrait of Madame Cézanne</a>" and other works from 1962 and 1963. It was also part of his second solo exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery from September 28 – October 24, 1963 that included "<a href="Torpedo...Los%21">Torpedo...Los!</a>", "<a href="Baseball%20Manager">Baseball Manager</a>", "In the Car", "Conversation", and "Whaam!". Marketing materials for the show included the <a href="lithograph">lithograph</a> "<a href="Crak%21">Crak!</a>" The Museum of Modern Art acquired "Drowning Girl" in 1971, and their webpage for this work credits <a href="Philip%20Johnson">Philip Johnson</a> and Mr. and Mrs. <a href="Bagley%20Wright">Bagley Wright</a> for the acquisition.

Some sources describe the subjects of Lichtenstein's tragic girls series as heroines (in the sense that they are the counterparts to the heroes), and others do not (in the sense that they are not heroic). "Drowning Girl" is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in to the power of the ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not know what happened before this moment and what is going to happen after it. Furthermore, the viewer has no way to know who Brad is and why she is so reluctant to call him.

According to "The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art", the most important element of Lichtenstein's procedure in the early 1960s was "the enlargement and unification of his source material". Although, according to some sources, the changes made to produce "Drowning Girl" are not regarded as significant, Lichtenstein made several notable changes from the original source: "In the original illustration, the drowning girl's boyfriend appears in the background, clinging to a capsized boat. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave. He changed the caption from 'I don't care if I have a cramp!' to 'I don't care!' and the boyfriend's name from Mal to Brad." With the former narrative change, Lichtenstein removed evidence that the drowning girl has a cramp in her leg. With the latter narrative change, Lichtenstein attempted to change the perception of the boyfriend. When discussing another work ("<a href="I%20Know...Brad">I Know...Brad</a>"), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of clichéd oversimplification.

Lichtenstein's method entailed "strengthening of the formal aspects of the composition, a stylization of motif, and a 'freezing' of both emotion and actions". Although comic-book panels depict a moment in time, "Drowning Girl" is borrowed from an example of a comic-book panel depiction of a moment relatively more "pregnant" with past- and future-dependent drama than most moments. This work also marks a phase in Lichtenstein's career when many of his works were given <a href="present%20participle">present-participial</a> titles such as "<a href="Sleeping%20Girl">Sleeping Girl</a>", "<a href="Crying%20Girl">Crying Girl</a>" and "Blonde Waiting", which accentuates the works' "relation to process and action." According to "The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art", during this phase of Lichtenstein's career "a constant if restrained and a gentle sense of humor contribute just as much to the cheerful lightness of Lichtenstein's work as the balanced, completely harmonious composition."
Narrative content was in the forefront of much of Lichtenstein's work as a means to engage the viewer. Measuring 171.6 cm × 169.5 cm (67.625 in × 66.75 in), "Drowning Girl" presents "a young woman who seems to have cried herself a river ... literally drowning in emotion," according to Janis Hendrickson. The <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a> makes it clear that she has been hurt by a "Brad", the name given to several of Lichtenstein's heroes. Vian Shamounki Borchert says that the caption makes it clear that the subject is practically "drowning in a sea of tears".

In typical Lichtenstein fashion, the tragic female is presented "in a suspended state of distress." According to Janis Hendrickson, the subject's head appears to rest on a wave as if it were a pillow and lies in the water as if it were a bed, creating a blend of "eroticism and final resting place". The waters of the sea swirl around the subject's waves of hair creating the perception of a whirlpool. The painting is representative of Lichtenstein's affinity for single-frame drama that reduces the viewer's ability to identify with it and that abstracts emotion. His use of industrial and mechanical appearance further trivialize the sentiments, although the painterly touches add to its simplification.

In the early 1960s Lichtenstein's theme of comics-based work was hotly debated. In a 1963 "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" article, <a href="Brian%20O%27Doherty">Brian O'Doherty</a> wrote that Lichtenstein's work was not art, saying Lichtenstein was "one of the worst artists in America" who "briskly went about making a sow's ear out of a sow's ear." This was part of a widespread debate about the merits of Lichtenstein's comic blow-ups as true art. In January 1964 "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" ran a story under the title "Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?" on this controversy. Later reviews were much kinder. <a href="Todd%20Brewster">Todd Brewster</a> noted that this may have been motivated by popular demand; he told "Life" in 1986 that "Those cartoon blowups may have disturbed the critics, but collectors, tired of the solemnity of abstract expressionism, were ready for some comic relief. Why couldn't the funny pages be fine art?" His work is now widely accepted, although some criticize him for borrowing from comics without attributing the original creators, paying royalties, or seeking permission from copyright holders. David Barsalou has dedicated decades to identifying all of Lichtenstein's source materials and has posted more than 1,000 images on <a href="Flickr">Flickr</a> detailing Lichtenstein's unrecognized sources.

Some critics question Lichtenstein's artistic skills. <a href="Everett%20Kinstler">Everett Kinstler</a> said that despite Lichtenstein's association with romance comics, in his day "no comics publisher would have hired Lichtenstein—he wasn't good enough." Kinstler said Lichtenstein lacked the ability to portray the emotional range of the story through facial expressions and body language independently.

Many sources describe "Whaam!" and "Drowning Girl" as Lichtenstein's most famous works. The "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" listed it along with "Whaam!" and "Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But..." as one of his most famous at the time of its 2013 Lichtenstein Retrospective display at the <a href="Tate%20Modern">Tate Modern</a>. It is also regarded as one of his most influential works along with "Whaam!" and "Look Mickey". <a href="John%20Elderfield">John Elderfield</a>, Museum of Modern Art chief curator noted that the 2004 "MoMA in Berlin" exhibition held during the Museum's renovation was a "synoptic overview of 20th-century art". Highlights from the 212-piece exhibition according to various publications such as "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and <a href="artnet">artnet</a> were <a href="van%20Gogh">van Gogh</a>'s "<a href="Starry%20Night">Starry Night</a>", <a href="Matisse">Matisse</a>'s "<a href="Dance%20%28Matisse%29">Dance</a>" and Lichtenstein's "Drowning Girl", all of which were touring outside the United States for the first time.

"Drowning Girl" was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a> from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the <a href="Tate%20Modern">Tate Modern</a> in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and <a href="The%20Centre%20Pompidou">The Centre Pompidou</a> from July 3 to November 4, 2013. During the 2012–13 retrospective, "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" described "Drowning Girl" as Lichtenstein's "masterpiece of melodrama". Danish art critic and <a href="Louisiana%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Louisiana Museum of Modern Art</a> director <a href="Poul%20Erik%20T%C3%B8jner">Poul Erik Tøjner</a> called the work an example of Lichtenstein's "post-<a href="coital">coital</a> perdition" pieces, describing it as the "star witness" of this genre of his works. He notes that the subject is reaching far-flung depths as she acts out of pride. Tøjner perceived eroticism in this painting, likening the open mouth to a vaginal feature and noting the singularity of Lichtenstein using an open mouth. With that in mind, he compares the tears to <a href="ejaculate">ejaculate</a> residue.
This was painted at the apex of Lichtenstein's use of enlarged dots, cropping and magnification of the original source. <a href="Solomon%20R.%20Guggenheim%20Museum">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a> curator Diane Waldman notes that Lichtenstein made "Drowning Girl" a cornerstone of his career because of "his extraordinary sense of organization, his ability to use a sweeping curve and manipulate it into an allover pattern". According to "The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists", the work is "a mix of cliché, melodrama, pathos, and absurdity ..." The result is described by art scholar Jonathan Fineberg as "a remarkably impassive style". The image is typical of Lichtenstein's depiction of comic subjects responding to a situation in a clichéd manner.

Lichtenstein's tinkering with the source material resulted in a recomposition with sharper focus after he eliminated several elements that distract from the depiction of the woman, such as the <a href="capsizing">capsized</a> boat, troubled male subject and the general seascape. The result was swirling, swooping waves and "animate white foam" that envelope the subject with a "pictorial buoyancy" that form an "aquatic continuum".

"Drowning Girl" presents an "unmistakeable acknowledgement to the flamboyant linearism of <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a>". The waves are intended to "recall <a href="Hokusai">Hokusai</a> as well as the biomorphic forms of <a href="Jean%20Arp">Arp</a> and <a href="Joan%20Mir%C3%B3">Miró</a>;" just as the source comics may have intended to. Lichtenstein has claimed a strong relation between the original comic book source panel and Hokusai's "<a href="The%20Great%20Wave%20off%20Kanagawa">The Great Wave off Kanagawa</a>", making this work a bridge between the two. The adaptation of the wave print is said to add a decorative look and feel to the painting, without which the work might be much more alarming to the viewer. Lichtenstein even made the connection between "Drowning Girl"'s arabesque waves and "the Art Nouveau aesthetic". Regarding this work, Lichtenstein stated:
Tøjner describes the work as "Lichtenstein's finest formulation of a counter-image to the many explosions in his universe", noting that the drama is past its peak although it may seem to be at a crescendo. He also notes that "the tears are drawn with classic Lichtenstein waxy fullness" despite the surrounding water, which must be significant since "naturalistic justification" is absent. A November 1963 "Art Magazine" review stated that this was one of the "broad and powerful paintings" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. Nonetheless, the name of the work was not universally known. In a December 1964 "Art Magazine" review of his October 24 – September 19, 1964 Castelli Gallery show, Lichtenstein was referred to as the author of "I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink" ("Drowning Girl"). According to Gary Garrels of the Museum of Modern Art, the work is a "poetics of the utterly banal, of displaced ordinariness" resulting in an "image frozen in time and space", making it "iconic". Comparing this to the source, Garrels says it is a rendering "in a simplified vocabulary" produced while Lichtenstein put aside his mechanical objectivity. According to "The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art", extreme examples of his formalization become "virtual abstraction" when the viewer recalls that the motif is an element of a larger work. Thus, Lichtenstein reinforced a non-realist view of comic strips and advertisements, presenting them as artificial images with minimalistic graphic techniques. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material stressed the plainness of his motifs as an equivalent to mechanical commercial drawing, leading to implications about his statements on modern industrial America. Nonetheless, Lichtenstein appears to have accepted the American capitalist industrial culture.

Lanchner wrote of how Lichtenstein's translation of a "highly charged" content with coolly handled presentation intensified the contrast between the two. While contrasting Lichtenstein's <a href="Ben-Day%20dots">Ben-Day dots</a> use in "Drowning Girl" with another artist's work, Sarah Rich and Joyce Henri Robinson note that the work "satirizes the melodrama of soap operas and serial comics, turning the drama of the title figure's potential suicide into a high camp performance".

1860 Boden Professor of Sanskrit election

The election in 1860 for the position of <a href="Boden%20Professor%20of%20Sanskrit">Boden Professor of Sanskrit</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> was a hotly contested affair between two rival candidates offering different approaches to <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> scholarship. One was <a href="Monier%20Williams">Monier Williams</a>, an Oxford-educated Englishman who had spent 14 years teaching Sanskrit to those preparing to work in <a href="British%20India">British India</a> for the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>. The other, <a href="Max%20M%C3%BCller">Max Müller</a>, was a German-born lecturer at Oxford specialising in <a href="comparative%20philology">comparative philology</a>, the science of language. He had spent many years working on an edition of the "<a href="Rig%20Veda">Rig Veda</a>" (an ancient collection of <a href="Vedic%20Sanskrit">Vedic Sanskrit</a> hymns), and had gained an international reputation for his scholarship. Williams, in contrast, worked on later material and had little time for the "continental" school of Sanskrit scholarship that Müller exemplified. Williams regarded the study of Sanskrit as a means to an end, namely the conversion of India to Christianity. For Müller, his work, while it would assist missionaries, was also valuable as an end in itself.

The election came at a time of public debate about Britain's role in India in the wake of the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a>. Opinions were divided on whether greater efforts should be made to convert India or whether to remain sensitive to local culture and traditions. Both men battled for the votes of the electorate (the <a href="Convocation">Convocation</a> of the university, consisting of over 3,700 graduates) through manifestos and newspaper correspondence. Williams laid great stress in his campaign on the intention of the original founder of the chair, that the holder should assist in converting India through dissemination of the Christian scriptures. Müller's view was that his work on the "Rig Veda" was of great value for missionary work, and published testimonials accordingly. He also wanted to teach wider subjects such as Indian history and literature to assist missionaries, scholars, and civil servants – a proposal that Williams criticised as not in accordance with the original benefactor's wishes. The rival campaigns took out newspaper advertisements and circulated manifestos, and different newspapers backed each man. Although generally regarded as the superior to Williams in scholarship, Müller had the double disadvantage (in the eyes of some) of being German and having liberal Christian views. Some of the newspaper pronouncements in favour of Williams were based on a claimed national interest of having an Englishman as Boden professor to assist with the work of governing and converting India.

Special trains to Oxford were provided on the day of the election, 7 December 1860, for non-residents to cast their votes. At the end of the hard-fought campaign, Williams won by a majority of over 220 votes. Thereafter, he helped to establish the <a href="Indian%20Institute">Indian Institute</a> at Oxford, received a knighthood, and held the chair until his death in 1899. Müller, although deeply disappointed by his defeat, remained in Oxford for the rest of his career, but never taught Sanskrit there. The 1860 election was the last time that Convocation chose the Boden professor, as this power was removed in 1882 as a result of reforms imposed by Parliament. , the professorship is still in existence, and is now the last remaining Sanskrit professorship in the United Kingdom.

The position of Boden professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> was established by the bequest of <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Joseph Boden of the <a href="Bombay%20Native%20Infantry">Bombay Native Infantry</a>, who died in 1811. His will provided that on the death of his daughter (which occurred in 1827), his estate should pass to the university to fund a <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> professorship. His purpose was to convert the people of India to Christianity "by disseminating a knowledge of the Sacred scriptures among them". The university statutes governing the chair provided that the professor should be chosen by the members of <a href="Convocation">Convocation</a> – all those who had obtained the Oxford degree of <a href="MA%20%28Oxon%29">Master of Arts</a>, whether or not they taught in the university – rather than by the professors and college <a href="Oxbridge%20Fellow">fellows</a>. At the time of the 1860 election, there were 3,786 members of Convocation. According to the religious historian Gwilym Beckerlegge, the professorship was regarded at the time as "prestigious and handsomely remunerated". An editorial in the British national newspaper "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in 1860 said that the professorship was "one of the most important, most influential, and most widely known institutions at Oxford, not to say in the whole civilised world." It paid between £900 and £1,000 per year for life.

The first Boden professor, <a href="Horace%20Hayman%20Wilson">Horace Hayman Wilson</a>, was elected in 1832 and died on 8 May 1860. The election for his successor came at a time of public debate about the nature of British missionary work in India, particularly after the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a>. The <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>, which <a href="Company%20rule%20in%20India">controlled the British territories</a> until they were absorbed into the <a href="British%20Raj">British Empire</a> in 1858, had had a general policy until 1813 of non-interference with Indian customs, including religion. Christian missionaries required a licence to proselytize. In practice, most could operate without a licence, except for <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelicals</a>, who were regarded as too radical in an age when Christians from other backgrounds were more prepared to be tolerant of other faiths. As the Evangelical movement grew in strength, it pressed for greater efforts to bring Christianity to India, and so the company relaxed its approach to missionaries in 1813. After 1858, the British government was reluctant to provoke further unrest by interference with local traditions and religion, but many of those charged with running India were themselves Evangelicals sympathetic to efforts to convert the country. As Beckerlegge has commented, "the furtherance of Christian mission had become inextricably bound up with attempts to define Britain's role in India and indeed to justify Britain's presence in India." The issue was whether Britain was there simply to govern India or to "civilise" it, and if the latter, whether to draw up or destroy India's existing culture and religion. Many of those who supported increased missionary work in India, says Beckerlegge, regarded the events of 1857 as "nothing less than a divine judgment" on Britain's failure to bring Christianity to the country.

There were two schools of thought on whether Sanskrit should be taught for the purpose of assisting the administration and conversion of India, or for its own merits. The East India Company had provided instruction in Sanskrit to its employees at <a href="East%20India%20Company%20College">its college at Haileybury</a>, Hertfordshire, and the <a href="College%20of%20Fort%20William">College of Fort William</a> in Calcutta, to educate them in local culture. For some, this led to an interest in Indian religion and culture as revealed in the Sanskrit texts. This was in contrast to the situation in continental Europe, where scholars examined Sanskrit as part of the "science of language", <a href="comparative%20philology">comparative philology</a>, rather than for reasons of imperial administration. Fewer European scholars visited India, but many British Sanskritists had lived and worked there. Some British scholars in other fields had strong doubts in any event about Sanskrit, as a "crude linguistic forgery pieced out of Latin and Greek", or as proving little "except a thoroughly unwelcome kinship between Briton and Brahmin", in the words of the American academic Linda Dowling.

Although five men indicated their intent to seek the chair in 1860 or were proposed in their absence, in the end the two who contested the election were <a href="Monier%20Williams">Monier Williams</a> and <a href="Max%20M%C3%BCller">Max Müller</a>. Williams (known later in life as Sir Monier Monier-Williams) was the son of an army officer and was born in India. He studied briefly at <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>, before training at Haileybury for the civil service in India. The death of his brother in battle in India led to him to return to Oxford to complete his degree. He also studied Sanskrit with Wilson before teaching this and other languages at Haileybury from 1844 until 1858, when it closed following the Indian rebellion. He prepared an English–Sanskrit dictionary, at Wilson's prompting, which the East India Company published in 1851; his Sanskrit–English dictionary was supported by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20India">Secretary of State for India</a>. As the Dutch anthropologist <a href="Peter%20van%20der%20Veer">Peter van der Veer</a> has written, Williams "had an Evangelical zeal" according with the views that had inspired Boden to establish the chair.

Müller was from the German duchy of <a href="Anhalt-Dessau">Anhalt-Dessau</a> and took up Sanskrit at university as a fresh intellectual challenge after mastering Greek and Latin. At this time, Sanskrit was a comparatively new subject of study in Europe, and its connections with the traditional classical languages had attracted interest from those examining the nature and history of languages. He obtained his doctorate from <a href="Leipzig%20University">Leipzig University</a> in 1843, aged 19, and after a year studying in Berlin he began work in Paris on the first printed edition of the "<a href="Rig%20Veda">Rig Veda</a>" (an ancient collection of <a href="Vedic%20Sanskrit">Vedic Sanskrit</a> hymns). What was supposed to be a brief visit to England for research in 1846 turned into a lifelong stay. The Prussian diplomat <a href="Christian%20Charles%20Josias%20von%20Bunsen">Baron von Bunsen</a> and Wilson persuaded the directors of the East India Company to provide financial support for <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> to publish the "Rig Veda". Müller settled in Oxford in 1848 and continued his Sanskrit research, becoming Taylorian Professor of Modern European Languages in 1854 after three years as the deputy professor; in this post he was paid £500 per year, half the stipend of the Boden chair. A British subject from 1855, he was elected a fellow of <a href="All%20Souls%20College%2C%20Oxford">All Souls College</a> in 1858, "an unprecedented honour for a foreigner at that time", in the words of his biographer, the Indian writer <a href="Nirad%20C.%20Chaudhuri">Nirad C. Chaudhuri</a>.

Three other scholars indicated an intention to stand for the chair, or were nominated by others, but withdrew before the ballot. The candidacy of <a href="Edward%20Byles%20Cowell">Edward Cowell</a>, Professor of Sanskrit at the Government College in Calcutta, was announced in "The Times" on 28 May 1860, where it was said that Wilson had pronounced him "eminently qualified" to succeed him. He later wrote from India refusing to stand against Müller. <a href="Ralph%20T.%20H.%20Griffith">Ralph Griffith</a>, a former <a href="Boden%20scholar">Boden scholar</a> who was a professor at the <a href="Government%20Sanskrit%20College%2C%20Varanasi">Government Sanskrit College</a> in <a href="Benares">Benares</a>, announced his candidacy in August 1860, but withdrew in November. <a href="James%20R.%20Ballantyne">James R. Ballantyne</a>, principal of the college in Benares, was proposed in June 1860 by friends based in England, who described him as the "chief of British Sanscrit scholars".

Müller announced his candidacy on 14 May 1860, six days after Wilson's death. His submission to Convocation referred to his work in editing the "Rig Veda", saying that without it missionaries could not fully learn about the teachings of Hinduism, which impeded their work. He therefore considered that he had "spent the principal part of my life in promoting the object of the Founder of the Chair of Sanskrit." He promised to work exclusively on Sanskrit, and said that he would provide testimonials from "the most eminent Sanskrit scholars in Europe and India" and from missionaries who had used his publications to help "overthrow the ancient systems of idolatry" in India. In due course, he was able to provide a list of missionary societies that had requested copies of the "Rig Veda" from the East India Company, including the <a href="Church%20Missionary%20Society">Church Missionary Society</a> and the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Propagation%20of%20the%20Gospel">Society for the Propagation of the Gospel</a>.

Williams declared his intention to stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller. In his written submission to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment in the light of Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years "the one idea of my life has been to make myself thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in my power to facilitate the study of its literature." He assured voters that, if elected, "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely "The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion." Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. In this way, Dowling says, he could attempt to deflect attention from his "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" when compared to Müller's "internationally acknowledged achievements". Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.

In August 1860, Müller wrote to the members of Convocation about his plans to teach a broad range of topics in addition to Sanskrit, including comparative philology, Indian history, and literature. Simply teaching the language "would be but a mean return" for Boden's generosity, he wrote. In this way, he would help to supply "efficient" missionaries, "useful" civil servants, and "distinguished" Boden scholars.

In turn, Williams wrote that if Boden had left instructions that the man elected should be the one "most likely to secure a world-wide reputation for the Sanskrit Chair, I confess that I should have hesitated to prosecute my design." However, this was not the case and it would be "unjustifiable" in terms of the statutes governing the chair if the professor were to lecture on wider topics. In his view, the Vedic literature was "of less importance" and the philosophical literature was "very mystical and abstruse", whereas "the classical or modern" period (the laws, two heroic poems, and the plays) was the "most important". Reminding his readers that he had edited two Sanskrit plays, he stated that the literature of the third period constituted the Sanskrit scriptures, not ("as has hitherto been believed") the Veda, "still less the Rig Veda". He commented that Müller's edition of the "Rig Veda" was requiring "an expenditure of time, labour, money, and erudition far greater than was ever bestowed on any edition of the Holy Bible", adding that Boden did not intend to "aid in the missionary work by perpetuating and diffusing the obsolescent Vedic Scriptures." He claimed that his own approach to Sanskrit scholarship, with his dictionaries and grammar books, was "suited to English minds", unlike Müller's "continental" and "philosophical" approach, which dealt with texts no longer relevant to modern Hindus that missionaries would not benefit from studying.

In a letter to "The Times" published on 29 October 1860, Müller took issue with Williams. To the claim that it would be unjustifiable to teach history, philosophy, and other subjects as Boden professor, he quoted from one of Wilson's public lectures in which he had said that it had always been his intention to offer "a general view of the institutions and social condition, the literature, and religion of the Hindus." He noted that he had published in all three areas into which Williams divided Sanskrit literature, and disputed Williams's views on the relative importance of Vedic literature with reference to a review of one of his publications by Wilson. Williams, he said, "stands as yet alone" in asserting that the heroic poems and the plays, not the Vedas, were the real scriptures. He refused to accept Williams's estimate of the labour involved in the edition of the "Rig Veda", and said that to compare his little effort with that carried out on the Bible was "almost irreverent." He concluded by attempting to rebut the claim that Boden would not have wanted the Vedic scriptures to be supported. He noted that the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Calcutta">Bishop of Calcutta</a> (<a href="George%20Cotton">George Cotton</a>) had written that it was of "the greatest importance" for missionaries to study Sanskrit and its scriptures "to be able to meet the Pundits on their own ground", and that the bishop's view was that nothing could be more valuable in this work that Müller's edition, and Wilson's translation, of the "Rig-Veda"."

After this letter, Williams complained about Müller conducting his campaign in the newspapers and misrepresenting what Williams was saying. Müller asked three professors and the Provost of <a href="Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">Queen's College</a> to consider the accuracy of his letter, and they pronounced in his favour. In Beckerlegge's view, all these replies and counter-replies did was "illustrate the increasingly heated tone of the exchanges" between the two men and their supporters. It was "as if the protagonists were prospective members of Parliament", in the words of one modern scholar. Terence Thomas, a British lecturer in religious studies, records "insults regarding the nationality of Max Müller and the proficiency of Monier Williams as a Sanskritist being bandied back and forth by their supporters." For example, one of the Boden scholars at Oxford, Robinson Ellis, claimed that Williams had not been able to prove that he could read a Sanskrit text. When challenged, he later amended this to a claim that Williams could only read a text when he could compare it to another one, describing this as "mechanical labour which is paid for at the public libraries at Paris and Berlin at the rate of half a crown a year."

Each had a committee of helpers; Williams had two, one in London, the other in Oxford. He spent over £1,000 on his campaign – as much as the Boden professor was paid in a year. In June 1860, Müller complained in a letter to his mother about having to write to each one of the "4,000 electors, scattered all over England"; he said that sometimes he wished he had not thought of standing for election, adding "if I don't win, I shall be very cross!".

According to Beckerlegge, there was a view held by many of those involved in the keenly fought struggle between Williams and Müller that more depended on the result than simply one man's career – missionary success or failure in India, "and even the future stability of British rule in this region" (in the light of events in India a few years previously) might depend on the abilities of the Boden professor. Victory would depend on each side's ability to persuade non-resident members of Convocation to return to Oxford to cast their votes. Each candidate had their supporters: Müller was backed by scholars of international merit, whereas Williams was able to call upon Oxford-based academics and those who had served in India as administrators or missionaries. Both candidates claimed support from Wilson – "as if the principle of apostolic succession was involved in the appointment", says Chaudhuri. "The Times" reported on 23 May that friends of Williams placed considerable weight upon a private letter to him from Wilson, "indicating Mr. Williams as his probable successor." In return, Wilson was revealed to have said "two months before his death" that "Mr. Max Müller was the first Sanskrit scholar in Europe". The source of this information was <a href="William%20Sandys%20Wright%20Vaux">W. S. W. Vaux</a>, of the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, who described his conversation with Wilson in a letter to Müller in May 1860. In reply to Vaux's comment that he and others wanted Wilson's successor to be "the finest man we could procure", Vaux quoted Wilson as saying that "You will be quite right if your choice should fall on Max Müller."

"The Times" published a list of leading supporters for each candidate on 27 June 1860, noting that many people were not declaring support for either "since they wish to see whether any person of real eminence announces himself from India". Müller was backed by <a href="Francis%20Leighton">Francis Leighton</a>, <a href="Henry%20Liddell">Henry Liddell</a> and <a href="William%20Thomson%20%28bishop%29">William Thomson</a> (the heads of the colleges of <a href="All%20Souls%2C%20Oxford">All Souls</a>, <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church</a>, and <a href="Queen%27s%2C%20Oxford">Queen's</a>), <a href="Edward%20Pusey">Edward Pusey</a>, <a href="William%20Jacobson">William Jacobson</a> and <a href="Henry%20Acland">Henry Acland</a> (the Regius Professors <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Hebrew%20%28Oxford%29">of Hebrew</a>, <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Divinity%20%28Oxford%29">of Divinity</a>, and <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Medicine%20%28Oxford%29">of Medicine</a>) and others. Williams had the declared support of the heads of <a href="University%2C%20Oxford">University</a> and Balliol colleges (<a href="Frederick%20Charles%20Plumptre">Frederick Charles Plumptre</a> and <a href="Robert%20Scott%20%28philologist%29">Robert Scott</a>), and <a href="Oxbridge%20Fellow">fellows</a> from ten different colleges.
On 5 December 1860, two days before the election, friends of Müller took out an advertisement in "The Times" to list his supporters, in response to a similar record circulated on behalf of Williams. By then, Müller's list included the heads of 11 colleges or halls of the university, 27 professors, over 40 college fellows and tutors, and many non-resident members of the university including <a href="Samuel%20Wilberforce">Samuel Wilberforce</a> (the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Oxford">Bishop of Oxford</a>) and <a href="Charles%20Wood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Halifax">Sir Charles Wood</a> (the Secretary of State for India). A list published on the following day added the name of <a href="Charles%20Longley">Charles Longley</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, to Müller's supporters. Overall, the public supporters for each candidate were about the same in number, but while Müller was backed by "all the noted Orientalists of Europe of the age", Williams's supporters "were not so distinguished", according to Chaudhuri.

Newspapers and journals joined the debate, some in strong terms. One evangelical publication, "The Record", contrasted the two candidates: Müller's writings were "familiar to all persons interested in literature, while they have destroyed confidence in his religious opinions"; Williams was described as "a man of sincere piety, and one who is likely, by the blessing of God on his labours, to promote the ultimate object which the founder of the Professorship had in view." Other newspapers highlighted the nationalities of the candidates; as Beckerlegge has put it, "voting for the Boden Chair was increasingly taking on the appearance of being a test of patriotism." "The Homeward Mail" (a London-based newspaper that concentrated on news from, and relating to, India) asked its readers whether they wanted "a stranger and a foreigner" to win, or "one of your own body". A writer in "<a href="The%20Morning%20Post">The Morning Post</a>" said that voters should "keep the great prizes of the English universities for English students". The "<a href="Morning%20Herald">Morning Herald</a>" said that it was "a question of national interest", since it would affect the education of civil servants and missionaries and therefore "the progress of Christianity in India and the maintenance of British authority in that empire". It anticipated that Britain would be ridiculed if it had to appoint a German to its leading academic Sanskrit position.

Müller was not without support in the press. An editorial in "The Times" on 29 October 1860 called him "nothing more nor less than the best Sanscrit scholar in the world." It compared the situation to the 1832 election, when there had also been a choice between the best scholar (Wilson) and a good scholar "who was held to have made the most Christian use of the gift" (<a href="William%20Hodge%20Mill">William Hodge Mill</a>). Williams, it said, appeared as "the University man ... , the man "sufficiently" qualified for the post, and, above all, as the man in whose hands, it is whispered, the interests of Christianity will be perfectly safe." His proposal not to teach history, philosophy, mythology or comparative philology "seems to strip the subject very bare" and would, it thought, leave the post as "an empty chair." It stated that Müller "best answers to the terms of Colonel Boden's foundation." His field of study – the oldest period of Sanskrit literature – "must be the key of the whole position", whereas Williams was only familiar with the later, "less authentic, and less sacred" writings. The editorial ended by saying that Oxford "will not choose the less learned candidate; at all events, it will not accept from him that this is the true principle of a sound Christian election."

Pusey, the influential "<a href="high%20church">high church</a>" Anglican theologian associated with the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a>, wrote a letter of support to Müller, reproduced in "The Times". In his view, Boden's intentions would be best advanced by electing Müller. Missionaries could not win converts without knowing the details of the religion of those with whom they were dealing, he wrote, and Müller's publications were "the greatest gifts which have yet been bestowed" on those in such work. He added that Oxford would gain by electing him to a position where Müller could spend all his time on work "of such primary and lasting importance for the conversion of India." Beckerlegge finds Pusey's support noteworthy, since Pusey would not have agreed with Müller's particular "broad" approach to Christianity, and was thus providing a judgment on the academic abilities of the candidate best placed to advance missionary work in India. One anonymous writer of a letter to the press in support of Müller, shortly before the election, expressed it thus: "A man's personal character must stand very high, and his theological opinions can afford but little ground for animadversion on either hand, when he unites as his unhesitating supporters Dr. Pusey and Dr. Macbride" – a reference to <a href="John%20Macbride%20%28professor%29">John Macbride</a>, described in the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>" as "a profoundly religious layman of the 'old' evangelical school". However, Dowling describes Müller as "impercipient of the subtle twists of theological argument, the fine shadings and compunctions of Victorian religious feeling" – a weakness that was held against him.

The election was held on 7 December 1860 in the <a href="Sheldonian%20Theatre">Sheldonian Theatre</a>. Three special trains were laid on between <a href="Didcot">Didcot</a> and Oxford that afternoon to meet passengers travelling from the west of England, and one additional train was provided between Oxford and London via Didcot in the evening. A London-bound train from the north of England called additionally at <a href="Bletchley">Bletchley</a> to allow onward connections to Oxford for passengers from places such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birkenhead. Evangelical clergymen turned out in force to vote. Over about five and a half hours of voting, 833 members of Congregation declared for Williams, 610 for Müller.

Historians have advanced various views as to why, even though Müller was generally regarded as the superior scholar, he lost to Williams. Beckerlegge suggests several possible factors: unlike Williams, Müller was known as a writer and translator rather than a teacher of Sanskrit, he did not have links to the East India Company or the Indian Civil Service that he could call upon for supporters, and he had not been educated at Oxford. In his obituary of Müller, <a href="Arthur%20Anthony%20Macdonell">Arthur Macdonell</a> (Boden professor 1899–1926) said that the election "came to turn on the political and religious opinions of the candidates rather than on their merits as Sanskrit scholars", adding that "party feeling ran high and large numbers came up to vote." Similarly, Dowling has written that "in the less cosmopolitan precincts outside Oxford ... the argument that Müller was 'not English' told heavily against him" since "the argument was (and was meant to be, of course) unanswerable." She adds that Tories opposed him for his liberal political views, traditionalist factions within Oxford rejected "Germanizing" reform, and "the Anglican clergy ... detected unbelief lurking in his umlaut". The American historian <a href="Marjorie%20Wheeler-Barclay">Marjorie Wheeler-Barclay</a> takes the view that the three motives for people voting against Müller cannot be disentangled. Those who supported Indian missionary work, Dowling writes, saw it as the key to continued British rule, and there was no need to take a chance by electing Müller, who had "a reputation for unsound religious opinions", since Williams was a scholar "of distinction known for his conservatism and piety."

Müller attributed his defeat to his German background and suspicions that his Christianity was insufficiently orthodox, factors that had been used to influence in particular those voters who were no longer resident members of the university. He had lost, he wrote, because of "calumnious falsehood and vulgar electioneering tactics" Williams wrote in his unpublished autobiography that he had been "favoured by circumstances" and that, unlike Müller, he had been regarded as politically and religiously conservative.

Williams was Boden professor until his death in 1899, although he retired from teaching (while retaining the title) in 1887 because of his health. He took as the title for his inaugural lecture "The Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work", in keeping with his views as to the role of the chair. Thomas notes that as the East India Company had switched to using English rather than Sanskrit or Persian for its work, "a natural source of students had already dried up not long after the Boden Chair was inaugurated [in 1832]". Williams helped establish the <a href="Indian%20Institute">Indian Institute</a> at Oxford, proposing the idea in 1875 and helping to raise funds for the project on his visits to India, and persuaded the university to add a degree course in oriental studies. His publications included translations of plays and grammatical works. He received a knighthood in 1886, and was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Indian%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire</a> in 1887, when he changed his surname to become Sir Monier Monier-Williams.

Robinson Ellis was required to attend Williams's lectures despite his low opinions of the new professor's abilities. Williams said that Ellis's "whole demeanour was that of a person who would have welcomed an earthquake or any convulsion of nature which would have opened a way for him to sink out of my sight". Overall, Williams won over most of those who had opposed his election, with the exception of Müller.

For Müller, losing the election was "a decisive turning point in his scholarly and intellectual life", according to Chaudhuri. It meant that Müller was never to teach Sanskrit at Oxford, although he remained there until his death in 1900; nor did he ever visit India. Greatly disappointed by not winning the chair, Müller "regularly avoided or snubbed Monier Williams and his family on the streets of Oxford", according to Williams. He was appointed to a chair of comparative philology in 1868, the first Oxford professorship to be established by the university itself without money from royal or private donations. He wrote a letter of resignation in 1875 when the university proposed to award an honorary doctorate to Williams, giving as his reason that he wanted to spend more time studying Sanskrit. Friends attempted to talk him out of it, and the university then appointed a deputy professor to discharge his duties, an honour he greatly appreciated.

The Indian historian Rajesh Kochhar, noting the East India Company's support for Müller, commented that "Oxford professors may have had their own reasons for their assessment of him, but the Company and the natives both found him very relevant." Despite his electoral defeat, he enjoyed a high reputation at Oxford and beyond: he "occupied a central role in the intellectual life of the nation", according to Beckerlegge, and was "viewed by the world as a model of academic success" (as Dowling puts it). Dowling considers that "[w]ithin his own lifetime, Müller was discredited as a linguistic scientist" and has "little relevance" to later models of the study of language. In Beckerlegge's opinion, Müller's views about the nature of Christian missionary work showed the difficulty at that time for Christian academics "actively working to promote a more tolerant and even-handed study of other religious traditions".
Of the other candidates, Cowell was elected as the first Sanskrit professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in 1867, supported by Müller and others. Griffith was principal of his college from 1861 until 1878 (succeeding Ballantyne); he carried out further work in India after his retirement, and died there. Ballantyne resigned as principal because of health problems and returned to England, where he served as librarian to the <a href="India%20Office">India Office</a> (a position that Wilson had held in addition to the professorship) until his death in 1864.

The academic Jeremy Dibble (in his biography of the composer <a href="John%20Stainer">John Stainer</a>, a friend of Müller) has written that the election "amply foreshadowed the ensuing battle between contemporary sacred and secular forces in the university, the anachronism of Oxford's systems of academic election and the burning need for reform". The <a href="Universities%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Cambridge%20Act%201877">Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Act 1877</a> continued a process of change imposed by Parliament that had begun in the middle of the 19th century, and empowered a group of commissioners to lay down new statutes for the university and its colleges. The commissioners' powers included the ability to rewrite trusts and directions attached to gifts that were 50 years old or more. The statutes governing the Boden chair were revised by the commissioners in 1882; Joseph Boden's original proselytising purpose was no longer mentioned, nor was the professor to be chosen by Convocation. The commissioners' new statutes for Balliol College in 1881 included a provision that the holder of the Boden professorship was to be appointed as a fellow of the college, creating a link between the chair and Balliol that is still in place. As with other professorships, the University Council now makes arrangements for convening a board of electors, upon which Balliol has two representatives, in the event of a vacancy. , the Sanskrit professor is <a href="Christopher%20Minkowski">Christopher Minkowski</a>, appointed in 2005. His predecessor <a href="Richard%20Gombrich">Richard Gombrich</a> has said that he had to "fight a great battle" in 2004 to ensure that another professor was appointed after he retired, and credited his victory to the university's realisation that it was the last chair in Sanskrit left in the United Kingdom.

O heilges Geist- und Wasserbad, BWV 165

' (O holy bath of Spirit and water), ', is a <a href="Bach%20cantata">church cantata</a> by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>. He composed it in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> for <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity Sunday</a> and led the first performance on 16 June 1715.

Bach had taken up regular cantata composition a year before when he was promoted to concertmaster at the Weimar court, writing one cantata per month to be performed in the , the court chapel in the ducal <a href="Schloss%20Weimar">"Schloss"</a>. was his first cantata for Trinity Sunday, the feast day marking the end of the first half of the <a href="liturgical%20year">liturgical year</a>. The <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by the court poet <a href="Salomo%20Franck">Salomo Franck</a> is based on the day's <a href="lectionary">prescribed gospel reading</a> about the meeting of Jesus and <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>. It is close in content to the gospel and connects the concept of the <a href="Trinity%20%28Christianity%29">Trinity</a> to <a href="baptism">baptism</a>.

The music is structured in six <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movements</a>, alternating <a href="aria">aria</a>s and <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s, and scored for a small ensemble of four vocal parts, strings and continuo. The voices are combined only in the closing chorale, the fifth <a href="stanza">stanza</a> of <a href="Ludwig%20Helmbold">Ludwig Helmbold</a>'s <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "", which mentions scripture, baptism and the <a href="Eucharist%20in%20the%20Lutheran%20Church">Eucharist</a>, in a summary of the cantata's topic. Based on the text full of <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> imagery, Bach composed a sermon in music, especially in the two recitatives for the bass voice, and achieved contrasts in expression. He led the first performance, and probably another on the Trinity Sunday concluding his first year as <a href="Thomaskantor">Thomaskantor</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> on 4 June 1724.

On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed (concert master) of the Weimar (<a href="court%20chapel">court chapel</a>) of the co-reigning dukes <a href="William%20Ernest%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar">Wilhelm Ernst</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Augustus%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Ernst August</a> of Saxe-Weimar. The position was created for him, possibly on his demand, giving him "a newly defined rank order" according to <a href="Christoph%20Wolff">Christoph Wolff</a>.

From 1695, an arrangement shared the responsibility for church music at the (court church) between the <a href="Johann%20Samuel%20Drese">Samuel Drese</a> and the <a href="Georg%20Christoph%20Strattner">Georg Christoph Strattner</a>, who took care of one Sunday per month while the served on three Sundays. The pattern probably continued from 1704, when Strattner was succeeded by Drese's son <a href="Johann%20Wilhelm%20Drese">Johann Wilhelm</a>. When Bach also assumed the principal responsibility for one cantata a month, the "'s" workload was further reduced to two Sundays per month.

The performance venue on the third tier of the court church, in German called (Heaven's Castle), has been described by Wolff as "congenial and intimate", calling for a small ensemble of singers and players. Performers of the cantatas were mainly the core group of the , formed by seven singers, three leaders and five other instrumentalists. Additional players of the military band were available when needed, and also town musicians and singers of the <a href="Gymnasium%20%28Germany%29">gymnasium</a>. Bach as the concertmaster probably led the performances as the first violinist, while the organ part was played by Bach's students such as Johann Martin Schubart and <a href="Johann%20Caspar%20Vogler">Johann Caspar Vogler</a>. Even in settings like chamber music, Bach requested a strong continuo section with cello, bassoon and <a href="violone">violone</a> in addition to the keyboard instrument.

While Bach had composed vocal music only for special occasions until his promotion, the regular chance to compose and perform a new work resulted in a program into which Bach "threw himself wholeheartedly", as Christoph Wolff notes. In his first cantata of the series, , for the double feast of <a href="Palm%20Sunday">Palm Sunday</a> and <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a>, he showed his skill in an elaborate work in eight <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movements</a>, for four vocal parts and at times ten-part instrumental writing, and presenting himself as a violin soloist.

The following table of works performed by Bach as concertmaster between 1714 and the end of 1715 is based on tables by Wolff and <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%BCrr">Alfred Dürr</a>. According to Dürr, is the eleventh cantata composition of this period. The works contain <a href="aria">aria</a>s and recitatives, as in contemporary opera, while earlier cantatas had concentrated on biblical text and chorale. Some works, such as , may have been composed earlier.

Bach composed for <a href="Church%20cantata%23Trinity">Trinity Sunday</a>, the Sunday concluding the first half of the liturgical year. The prescribed readings for the day were from the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a>, "What depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God" (), and from the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a>, the meeting of Jesus and <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> ().

In Leipzig, Bach composed two more cantatas <a href="Church%20cantata%20%28Bach%29%23Trinity">for the occasion</a> which focused on different aspects of the readings, , first composed for the inauguration of church and organ in <a href="St%C3%B6rmthal">Störmthal</a> on 2 November 1723, (1725) and the <a href="Chorale%20cantata%20%28Bach%29">chorale cantata</a> (1726). Scholars debate if Bach performed on Trinity Sunday of 1724, which fell on 4 June, or or both.

The libretto was written by the court poet, Salomon Franck, and published in in 1715. The opening refers to Jesus' words in John 3:5: "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."() The second movement, a <a href="recitative">recitative</a>, reflects upon birth in the Spirit as <a href="baptism">baptism</a> through God's grace: "" (In the bath of spirit and water he becomes a child of blessedness and grace). Movement 3, an aria for alto, considers that the bond has to be renewed throughout life, because it will be broken by man, reflected in movement 4. The last aria is a prayer for the insight that the death of Jesus brought salvation, termed "" (death's death). The cantata concludes with the fifth <a href="stanza">stanza</a> of <a href="Ludwig%20Helmbold">Ludwig Helmbold</a>'s <a href="hymn">hymn</a> of 1575, "", mentioning scripture, baptism and the <a href="Eucharist%20in%20the%20Lutheran%20Church">Eucharist</a>. Bach used the eighth and final stanza, "Erhalt uns in der Wahrheit" (Keep us in the truth), to conclude his cantata <a href="Gott%20der%20Herr%20ist%20Sonn%20und%20Schild%2C%20BWV%2079">"Gott der Herr ist Sonn und Schild", BWV 79</a>.

Salomon expresses his thought in <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> style rich in imagery. The image of the serpent is used in several meanings: as <a href="Serpent%20%28Bible%29">the serpent</a> which seduced Adam and Eve to sin in paradise, as <a href="Nehushtan">the symbol</a> which <a href="Moses">Moses</a> erected in the desert, and related to the gospel's verse 14: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up".

Bach led the first performance of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the work again as <a href="Thomaskantor">Thomaskantor</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant <a href="Johann%20Christian%20K%C3%B6pping">Johann Christian Köpping</a>. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's first year in office, 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed the office on the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.

The cantata was published in the , the first edition of Bach's complete works by the , in 1887 in volume 33, edited by <a href="Franz%20W%C3%BCllner">Franz Wüllner</a>. In the second edition of the complete works, the , it appeared in 1967, edited by Dürr, with a (Critical report) following in 1968.

The title on the copy by Johann Christian Köpping is: "Concerto a 2 Violi:1 Viola. Fagotto Violoncello S.A.T.e Basso e Continuo / di Joh:Seb:Bach" (Concerto for 2 violins, 1 viola. Bassoon Cello S.A.T and Bass and Continuo / by Joh:Seb:Bach). The cantata in six movements is scored like <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a> for four vocal soloists (<a href="soprano">soprano</a>, <a href="alto">alto</a>, <a href="tenor">tenor</a> and <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a>), a <a href="SATB">four-part choir (SATB)</a> in the closing chorale, two <a href="violin">violin</a>s (Vl), <a href="viola">viola</a> (Va), <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a> (Fg), <a href="cello">cello</a> (Vc) and <a href="basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a> (Bc). The bassoon is called for, but has no independent part. The duration is given as about 15 minutes.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, and the abbreviations for voices and instruments the <a href="List%20of%20Bach%20cantatas%23Abbreviations">list of Bach cantatas</a>. The <a href="Key%20%28music%29">keys</a> and <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s are taken from the Bach scholar <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%BCrr">Alfred Dürr</a>, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.

The cantata consists of solo movements closed by a four-part chorale. Arias alternate with two recitatives, both sung by the bass. <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a> summarizes: "It is a true sermon in music, based on the Gospel account of Jesus' night-time conversation with Nicodemus on the subject of 'new life', emphasising the spiritual importance of baptism." He points out the many musical images of water.

In the first aria, "" (O bath of Holy Spirit and of water), the <a href="ritornello">ritornello</a> is a <a href="Fugue%20%28music%29">fugue</a>, whereas in the five vocal sections the soprano and violin I are a duo in imitation on the same material. These sections are composed in <a href="Symmetry%20%28music%29">symmetry</a>, A B C B' A'. The theme of B involves an <a href="Melodic%20inversion">inversion</a> of material from A, that of C is derived from measure 2 of the ritornello. Dürr writes:

The first recitative, "" (The sinful birth of the cursed heirs of Adam), is <a href="Glossary%20of%20musical%20terminology%23secco">secco</a>, but several phrases are close to an <a href="arioso">arioso</a>. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that Bach follows the meaning of the text closely, for example by "rhythmic dislocations for death and destruction", a change in harmony on "poisoned", and "the complete change of mood at the mention of the blessed Christian". He summarizes: "Here anger and resentment at Man’s inheritance of suppurating sin is contrasted against the peace and joy of God-given salvation".

The second aria, "" (Jesus, who out of great love), accompanied by the continuo, is dominated by an expressive <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a> with several upward leaps of <a href="Interval%20%28music%29%23Main%20intervals">sixths</a>, which is introduced in the ritornello and picked up by the alto voice in four sections. Mincham notes that "the mood is serious and reflective but also purposeful and quietly resolute".

The second recitative, "" (I have indeed, o bridegroom of my soul), is accompanied by the strings ("accompagnato"), marked by Bach "Rec: con Stroment" (Recitative: with instruments). The German musicologist <a href="Klaus%20Hofmann">Klaus Hofmann</a> notes that the text turns to mysticism, reflecting the Bridegroom, Lamb of God and the serpent in its double meaning. The text is intensified by several <a href="melisma">melisma</a>s, a marking "<a href="Tempo%20%28music%29">adagio</a>" on the words "" (most holy Lamb of God), and by melodic parts for the instruments. Gardiner notes that Bach has images for the <a href="Nehushtan">serpent</a> displayed in the desert by <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, and has the accompaniment fade away on the last line "" (when all my strength has faded).

The last aria, "" (Jesus, death of my death), is set for tenor, accompanied by the violins in <a href="unison">unison</a>, marked "Aria Violini unisoni e Tenore". The image of the serpent appears again, described by the composer and musicologist <a href="William%20G.%20Whittaker">William G. Whittaker</a>: "the whole of the <a href="obbligato">obbligato</a> for violins in unison is constructed out of the image of the bending, writhing, twisting reptile, usually a symbol of horror, but in Bach's musical speech a thing of pellucid beauty".

The cantata closes with a four-part setting of the chorale stanza, } (His word, His baptism, His communion).
The text in four short lines summarizes that Jesus helps any in need by his words, his baptism and his communion, and ends in the prayer that the Holy Spirit may teach to faithfully trust in this.

The hymn tune by <a href="Nikolaus%20Selnecker">Nikolaus Selnecker</a> was first published in Leipzig in 1587 in the hymnal "Christliche Psalmen, Lieder vnd Kirchengesenge" (Christian psalms, songs and church chants). Bach marked the movement: "", indicating that the instruments play with the voices.
