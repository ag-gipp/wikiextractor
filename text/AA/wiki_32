Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)

The second season of the American television series "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.", which is based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division), revolves around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and allies, who attempt to rebuild the organization following of the terrorist organization Hydra. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise, and was produced by ABC Studios, Marvel Television, and Mutant Enemy Productions. Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell served as showrunners.

A second season of "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." was ordered in May 2014, and production began that July. Alongside Clark Gregg, who reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, principal cast members Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge return from the first season, and are joined by Nick Blood and Adrianne Palicki. Several other characters from MCU films and Marvel One-Shots also appear throughout the season. Some episodes directly crossover with the television series "Agent Carter" and the film "", while the introduction of the Inhumans sets up the planned film of the same name and creates connections to the film "Guardians of the Galaxy".

The season premiere was watched by 5.98 million people, less than half the viewing total for the first season premiere, which was watched by 12.12 million people. The season, which premiered on ABC on September 23, 2014, and ran until May 12, 2015, over 22 episodes, overall had lower but much more consistent viewership than the previous season, as well as a much more positive critical response. The series was renewed for a third season on May 7, 2015.

In March 2014, executive producer Jeffrey Bell stated at the "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." PaleyFest panel that the writers are able to read the screenplays for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe films to know where the universe is heading, which allowed them to form a plan for the show through the end of a third season. On May 8, 2014, the series was renewed for a second season of 22 episodes.

In July 2014, Clark Gregg stated that the season resumes months after the end of season one, and "the monumental nature of [rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D.] is made very clear almost immediately, because you realize everyone—US government, US military and other wise—wants to arrest us. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s illegal. We have very few resources. Everything we're going to do involves dealing with, still, finding out who's Hydra and who's not amongst our friends. To rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D., we're going to need some old friends to prove themselves, some new friends, and we're going to have to do it in a way that's very back alley, old school."

In September 2014, talking about whether the ending of the season would also be a satisfying end to the series, Bell said "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [to season 2] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." He also talked about whether the themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying "In many ways, the whole metaphor at the heart of the show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, "She's still Skye, because "she" thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity."

In December 2014, Jed Whedon explained the benefits of introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying "One of the things that, early on was very important to us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on "Thor", he says, "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".

After the season finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that "he paid a price—that was important to us. You don't mess with the forces of nature without getting bitten, and the fact that he literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".

All principal cast members from the first season (Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Brett Dalton as Grant Ward, Chloe Bennet as Skye, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, and Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons) returned for the second season, and were joined by Nick Blood as Lance Hunter. In December 2014, main character Skye was revealed to be a version of Daisy Johnson. With the episode "Aftershocks", Adrianne Palicki, who portrays Bobbi Morse, was upgraded to a principal cast member. Also returning from earlier in the series are Christine Adams as Anne Weaver, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, B.J. Britt as Antoine Triplett, Imelda Corcoran as Goodman, Dylan Minnette as Donnie Gill, Ruth Negga as Raina, Patton Oswalt as The Koenigs, Adrian Pasdar as Glenn Talbot, J. August Richards as Mike Peterson / Deathlok, and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill.

At the San Diego Comic Con in July 2014, Reed Diamond was announced as portraying Daniel Whitehall. In August, Kyle MacLachlan was cast as Skye's father, in a recurring role. Initially referred to as "The Doctor", his character was revealed to be Calvin Zabo in December 2014. In "Making Friends and Influencing People", the character of Kara Palamas / Agent 33 was introduced, portrayed by Maya Stojan. She is also portrayed by other cast members, including Ming-Na Wen and Chloe Bennet, when she takes on the appearance of their characters. On October 1, 2014, Tim DeKay was cast as Senator Christian Ward, the older brother of principal character Grant Ward, who had previously appeared as a teenager through flashbacks in "The Well". In January 2015, Edward James Olmos was cast as Robert Gonzales, a leader of the "Real S.H.I.E.L.D." group. Mark Allan Stewart makes several appearances as another "Real S.H.I.E.L.D." leader, Agent Oliver. Other recurring guests include Jamie Harris as Gordon, Simon Kassianides as Sunil Bakshi, Dichen Lachman as Jiaying, Luke Mitchell as Lincoln Campbell, and Henry Simmons as Alphonso "Mack" MacKenzie.

Additionally, Hayley Atwell, Kenneth Choi, Henry Goodman, and Neal McDonough reprise their roles from MCU films and Marvel One-Shots, as Peggy Carter, Jim Morita, Dr. List, and Timothy "Dum Dum" Dugan, respectively, during the season.

During the season, the producers worked with Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios to help create Raina's Inhuman look, and introduce the Inhumans to the MCU. To get to the final look, the writers spent a lot of time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the Clive Barker film "Nightbreed", specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because "She's a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong — it creates such a striking silhouette". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to "make her feel like the first real Inhuman" and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, the producers wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, "Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [the makeup]."

For the "real S.H.I.E.L.D." faction introduced this season, the producers and Marvel decided to create a new S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, to differentiate from the normal one used on the series. This new logo uses the shape of Captain America's original shield, as opposed to the updated round shape, and has 3 stars on it.

Production on the season began in late July 2014, in Culver City, California. Additional photography took place around the world, including in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico for "...Ye Who Enter Here" and "What They Become".

To reflect the darker tone of the second season, the standard orchestra was changed from season one, with the low brass and strings expanded, and the woodwind section reduced, "giving [the orchestra] added punch and menace." Composer Bear McCreary's use of the electric guitar was also reduced for the second season, while his general synth programming was changed from "warm, round tones" to "mangled under heavy distortion" sound.

McCreary introduced a new Hydra theme for the season, explaining that "Last season got pretty musically complicated. I had a theme that associated itself with Centipede, The Clairvoyant, John Garrett and Raina. That theme ultimately functioned like a Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Victoria Hand that, while the audience briefly suspected her, also functioned as the Hydra Theme. I had a[nother] theme for Garrett that also acted like the theme for Hydra. It got so complicated ... The answer was obvious: I needed to write a new Hydra Theme, one that could be associated with Dr. Whitehall." For Hayley Atwell's appearances as Peggy Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the "Agent Carter" short film. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, "I was excited for the opportunity to incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference." A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons was released by Marvel Music digitally on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015.

Executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen stated the production team was not ruling out creating crossover episodes with "Agent Carter" or "Guardians of the Galaxy" during the season, with executive producer Jed Whedon adding that any such episodes would not equal the scale seen in the "" crossover from the first season, saying, "In terms of game-changers, [those episodes are] hard to beat." Bell later said "" "is coming up and we know what's going on with that and look forward to seeing it, but it's pretty cool to find ways to tie-in stuff and connect things." In December 2014, ABC confirmed the series would tie-in with "Avengers: Age of Ultron", with Whedon saying, "You should expect something. "The Avengers" is the big tent that all the franchises play under. Obviously, we're included in that." The episodes "The Frenemy of My Enemy" and "The Dirty Half Dozen" feature "Easter eggs, plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of "Avengers: Age of Ultron"" while "Scars" explores the aftermath of the film.

Talking on how the season would interact with "Agent Carter", Bell said, "Here's what I think is interesting. "Agent Carter" seems to be about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives us an opportunity to return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that S.S.R. stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we're going to try to do it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." Several scenes in "Shadows" and "The Things We Bury" are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of "Agent Carter", setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The episode "Making Friends and Influencing People" names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in "Agent Carter", played by Ralph Brown.

The season confirms that the blue alien seen in the first season, and a recurring plot point this season, was a member of the Kree race, who play a significant role in "Guardians of the Galaxy". Whedon explained that "We obviously showed this body a year ago at around this time. When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we had to talk to features about what their plans were and where they were going." When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to "Guardians of the Galaxy", Whedon said "It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In "Guardians", we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too." This storyline also introduces the Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their own film.

At the end of the season, Bell stated on the way that the season had tied in with the films, "we got to be our own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us."

In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he believed the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for "Agent Carter", before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [viewers] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and there has to be a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, "Agent Carter" comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.

The season began airing on September 23, 2014, on ABC in the United States, and on CTV in Canada, and concluded on May 12, 2015. In Australia, the season debuted on September 29, 2014, on Seven Network, while Channel 4 in the United Kingdom premiered the season on October 24, 2014.

At the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, ahead of the premiere of the season, Marvel Custom Solutions and Lexus released a limited single-issue comic tie-in titled , set between the Season 1 episodes "Seeds" and "T.R.A.C.K.S.", written by George Kitson, and with art by Mirko Colak, Neil Edwards, and Mirco Pierfederici. On October 10, 2014, "Face My Enemy" was screened at New York Comic Con.

For the final twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the "Art of..." initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, "maybe we'll show [the artist] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And then we have a conversation with them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's one of the things [the producers] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.

The poster for "Aftershocks", created by Gabriele Dell'Otto, the co-creator of Daisy Johnson, depicts Skye twice, as she is transforming from the Terrigen mist and as the person dealing with her powers, as well as a transformed Raina, Coulson and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background. For "Who You Really Are", the producers enlisted Marcos Martín to create the poster, which highlighted Sif's (Jaimie Alexander) return to the show, as well as an "inside look" at S.H.I.E.L.D. as the logo crumbles, with Skye in the center of it, ambiguously leaving the viewer questioning if the logo was crumbling due to Sif's sword, or Skye's powers. The third poster, for "One of Us", was created by Declan Shalvey and Jordie Bellaire. It features muted colors and shows "Coulson surrounded by villains [from the S.H.I.E.L.D. index], and the giant Cal looming over, and [a bird and] S.H.I.E.L.D. behind him." Annie Wu was brought on for the "Love in the Time of Hydra" poster, which shows Grant Ward holding a woman, though depicts her as two; one drawn in red, the other in blue – "half of that goes to Agent 33, who has two faces... And it also goes to the fact that she's been imitating other people as she did with Agent May."

"One Door Closes", an episode focused on Bobbi Morse's history, received a poster of her with the "real S.H.I.E.L.D." logo, that "embraced the basics" of four-color printing, utilizing magenta, cyan, black and yellow, while still having layers and complications, much like the character of Morse. The poster was designed by Delicious Design League. The poster for "Afterlife" by Dave Johnson, highlights the divide within S.H.I.E.L.D. and the alliances on each side. With Coulson in the middle, Agents Gonzales, Morse, Mackenzie and Weaver stem from the "real S.H.I.E.L.D.", while Hunter, Fitz and Simmons stem from the other. "Melinda"s poster, by Jenny Frison, mirrored the focus of the episode by prominently featuring an image of May, highlighting her backstory and why she is called "the Cavalry". Marvel teamed with Nathan Fox on the poster for "The Frenemy of My Enemy", which depicts Ward, Kara, and Bakshi in "Hydra red"; Coulson, Hunter, and Fitz in "S.H.I.E.L.D. blue"; and Deathlok neutral. They are all featured together, just as the season is "starting to put [all of its plotlines] together in new combinations in new ways, [to] propel us into the last four episodes."

As alluded to by the episode title, the poster for "The Dirty Half Dozen", with art by Jake Wyatt, sees the original recruits to Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. team from the first season (May, Ward, Fitz, Simmons and Skye), along with Coulson, together once again, suiting up for a mission together; it is also the first poster of the "Art of..." series to feature the episode title on the poster. Marguerite Sauvage provided the poster for "Scars", which prominently features Jiaying and her scars in a way that the series cannot do with special effects, while also depicting Skye near the former's stomach to cement the maternal connection between them. For Part One of the season finale, "S.O.S", Ryan Sook's poster hints at Cal's transformation into the Mr. Hyde persona from the comics, in an homage to traditional comic book covers. For Part Two, artist Joshua Budich brought together all of the main players of the season, divided into Coulson and his team, and those who served as antagonists to them throughout the season (though not necessarily villains), with Skye and some Terrigen crystals in the middle, pointing to Skye's confused allegiances and the importance of the crystals in the finale.

The season began streaming on Netflix on June 11, 2015, and was released on September 18, 2015, on Blu-ray and DVD as an Amazon.com exclusive.

The season averaged 7.09 million total viewers, including from DVR, ranking 76th among network series in the 2014–15 television season. It also had an average total 18-49 rating of 2.7, which was 32nd.

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 97% approval rating with an average score of 7.66/10, based on 29 reviews. The website's consensus reads, ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." relaxes into itself during its sophomore season, mitigating the show's growing pains by focusing on characters while amping up narrative thrills."

Marc Buston for "Den of Geek" scored the premiere episode 4.5 stars out of 5, feeling that the series had finally reached its potential by incorporating Marvel elements such as Creel and Whitehall, while also creating a darker tone and developing the original characters. He specifically highlighted the changes made to Fitz' character, saying "This lair of tragedy greatly deepens Fitz's character and gives the comic relief of last season a heartbreaking edge." James Hunt, also for "Den of Geek", gave a positive review as well, stating "The momentum of last season's finale hasn't been lost, and indeed, it's even been added to. Last year I criticised the pilot episode for, above all else, failing to recreate the feel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This year, it's only fair that I praise the season opener for doing exactly that." Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush called the premiere "unexpectedly good", noting that the series "remains as serialized a show as it can over 22 episodes", introducing new and interesting ideas for the rest of the season, while also setting a high standard for subsequent episodes to meet.

Alan Sepinwall at HitFix called the episode a promising start to the season, "a fairly lively hour in spite of [a lot of exposition], helped by some good casting and smart creative choices". He was positive about both the changes to the existing characters and the introduction of the new ones, and though he noted that the opening sequence was "itself a piece of brand extension — early promotion for "Agent Carter"," he felt that "Links to the rest of the Marvel [Cinematic U]niverse are always welcome when they're in service to the story the show is telling". Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the visual style, which he called "less glossy" than previous episodes, as well as the introduction of new characters and development of old ones, especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the "nicely done FX showing off his power". Oliver Sava of "The A.V. Club" graded the episode a 'B-', feeling that "With a clearly defined villain and mission statement, this show's second season is already off to a better start than its first year, but there's still plenty of room for the series to grow. The scripts could use more energy, the action could be better choreographed, and it could use a huge injection of style for both the visual and audio elements. There's so much potential in "Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D." ... but the show's creators aren't fully exploring it yet."

At the end of the season, Goldman graded it an 8.2 out of 10, saying the season "found the show much-improved, as it moved faster and delved deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe." Compared to the first season, Goldman felt the "pacing was hugely improved, with storylines no longer taking forever to bubble up again and secrets no longer being kept both from the audience and the characters," with content from the first season being resolved, while still introducing new plot lines and mysteries to play out over the season. He also praised the characterization improvement and called the season "less restrained" in connecting to its comics roots. While he appreciated the new characters that join the series, specifically MacLachlan's portrayal of Cal, he felt Triplett was "never fully utilized", which made his death in the midseason finale less impactful. Additionally, Goldman criticized the tie-in to "Age of Ultron", calling it "forced" and distracting from the Inhuman/S.H.I.E.L.D. 2.0 storylines. Nick Hogan at TV Overmind rated the season 9 out of 10 stars, calling it, "for the most part, a very enjoyable season of television." Hogan praised that cast and characters, particularly MacLachlan's portrayal of Calvin Zabo, saying "He had perhaps the strongest character arc of anyone this season, and it was such a pleasure to watch." He did criticize some of the story direction, feeling that it took a while for the Inhumans to connect to the rest of the series, and that the way the "Age of Ultron" tie-in concluded the S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. storyline was "rushed and choppy".

The season's introduction of the Inhumans and apparent willingness to establish new norms ahead of the films has been highlighted by critics:

Sava felt that having the series introduce the race made "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." "an essential part of Marvel Studios' bigger plans for the future", explaining that "the series has become more and more connected to the larger MCU since "Captain America: The Winter Soldier", but it's always been in a reactive role. Stuff happens in the movies, and "Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D." deals with the fallout. Not anymore. This show is making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU because we know there's an "Inhumans" movie planned for 2019." Sava also mentioned that introducing the Inhumans "on a personal level rather than a cosmic level" via the television series makes "the whole idea a bit easier to swallow" for the general MCU audience.

Merrill Barr of "Forbes" thought that by not only introducing the Inhumans ahead of the film, but by depicting the spreading of the race throughout the world, was part of the series cementing its "right to exist" apart from the films. Talking about the season finale, Barr said, ""S.H.I.E.L.D." does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame, all anyone – Marvel fan or otherwise – will be asking is when season three begins. The note the show leaves viewers on is one that will make them realize, perhaps for the first time, that the journey of "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." is not only worth it now, but perhaps always has been."

The Boat Race 1966

The 112th Boat Race took place on 26 March 1966. Held annually, the event is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. The race was won by Oxford by three-and-three-quarter-lengths. Isis won the reserve race while Cambridge won the Women's Boat Race.

The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities, followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the previous year's race by three-and-three-quarter lengths. Cambridge, however, held the overall lead with 61 victories to Oxford's 49 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).

The first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men's main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.

Two days before the main race and in inclement weather, the Cambridge boat began to sink and was pushed into barges and tugs moored below Beverley Brook. The crew were rescued and according to their boat club president Mike Sweeney, the incident would have no impact on the Light Blues: "we shall just get into our other boat and race in that". It was the first Boat Race vessel to sink since the 1951 race. The Light Blues would row in the same boat in which they won the 1962 and 1964 races, while Oxford's craft was manufactured by Swiss firm Stämpfli Racing Boats. Both boats were German-rigged, where the number four and five row on the bow side. The inclement weather continued until the day of the race, with further disruption predicted and the threat of postponement a real one. The race was umpired by the former Cambridge University Boat Club president and rower Alan Burrough who took part in Cambridge's victory in the 1939 race.

The Cambridge crew were coached by D. C. Christie (who rowed for Cambridge in the 1958 and 1959 races), J. G. P. Crowden (who won Blues in the 1951 and the 1952 races), D. M. Jennens (who rowed three times between 1949 and 1951) and I. W. Welsh (who participated in the 1956 race). Oxford's coach was Ronnie Howard who had rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1957 and 1959 races.

The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 13 st 7 lb (85.5 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Oxonians Chris and Richard Freeman became the first brothers to row in the Boat Race since 1935 race. The Oxford crew contained a single former Blue, the boat club president and number two Duncan Clegg, while Cambridge saw Rodney Ward and stroke Mike Sweeeny return. Oxford's P. G. Tuke was following in the footsteps of his great grandfather F. E. Tuke who had rowed in the 1845 race. There were three non-British participants in the race, the Oxford cox Jim Rogers, and Cambridge rowers J. H. Ashby and P. H. Conze were all American.

Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. Despite the prediction of poor weather and the threat of postponement, the race commenced at the planned time of 4.15pm. Oxford made the better start and were half-a-length up on Cambridge, but with the advantage of the Middlesex bend, the Light Blues were one second behind at the Mile Post. Oxford reacted to a Cambridge push at Harrods Furniture Depository to maintain the lead which they extended to two seconds by Hammersmith Bridge. The Dark Blues continued to contain Cambridge's attempts to reduce the deficit and by Chiswick Steps had clear water with a three-second advantage. Pushing away once again, and with a two-length lead, Oxford's cox Jim Rogers steered them across the Cambridge boat to the Middlesex side, and were ten seconds ahead at Barnes Bridge. Oxford won by three-and-three-quarter lengths in a time of 19 minutes 12 seconds.

In the reserve race, and after a false start, Oxford's Isis beat Cambridge's Goldie by seventh lengths, their second consecutive victory, in a time of 19 minutes 22 seconds. In the 21st running of the Women's Boat Race, Cambridge triumphed, their fourth consecutive victory.

The Boat Race 1881

The 38th Boat Race, an annual side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames, took place on 8 April 1881. In a race umpired by Robert Lewis-Lloyd, Oxford won by a margin of three lengths in a time of 21 minutes 51 seconds taking the overall record to 20–17 in their favour.

The Boat Race is an annual rowing eight competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. First held in 1829, the competition is a race along The Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions having won the previous year's race by three-and-three-quarter lengths, and held the overall lead, with 19 victories to Cambridge's 17 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).

Cambridge were coached by Constantine William Benson (who rowed for Cambridge in the 1872, 1873 and 1875 races), Charles Gurdon (a Blue four times from 1876 to 1879), Thomas Edmund Hockin (also rowed four times from 1876 to 1879) and Edward Henry Prest (who represented Cambridge in the 1878, 1879 and 1880 races). Oxford's coaches were S. D. Darbishire (who rowed for Oxford in the 1868, 1869 and 1870 races), William Grenfell (who rowed in 1877 and 1879, and was non-rowing boat club president in 1879), H. B. Southwell (a Blue three times from 1878 to 1880) and W. B. Woodgate (who rowed twice, in the 1862 and 1863 races). The umpire for the race was Robert Lewis-Lloyd (who had rowed for Cambridge four times between 1856 and 1859) and the starter was Edward Searle.

The night before the race, an anniversary dinner was held to belatedly commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the event.

The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11 st 11.75 lb (75.0 kg), more than their opponents. Cambridge's crew included two former Blues, with Humphrey Sandford making his third appearance in the event. Oxford saw five rowers with Boat Race experience return, including J. H. T. Wharton who was rowing for a third time.

On the day of the race, Oxford's number six David Edward Brown was ill – author and rower George Drinkwater suggested that "it was necessary for West [Oxford's stroke] to nurse him as much as possible." Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge. In a cold north-easterly wind, the race commenced at 8.24am with the Dark Blues outrating Cambridge and taking an early lead. Taking advantage of the favourable bend in the river, Oxford were half-a-length ahead by the Crab Tree pub. 

Cambridge began to reduce the deficit as Oxford decreased their stroke rate, and by Harrods Furniture Depository the crews were nearly level. Although the bend of the river now was in favour of Cambridge, Oxford increased their rating once again and by Hammersmith Bridge held a three-quarter-length lead. They held off spurts from the Light Blues along Chiswick Reach and by Chiswick Eyot were clear. A two-length lead at Barnes Railway Bridge was increased to three by the time Oxford passed the finishing post, winning in a time of 21 minutes 51 seconds. It was Oxford's second consecutive victory and took the overall record to 20–17 in their favour.

The Boat Race 1891

The 48th Boat Race took place on 21 March 1891. The Boat Race is an annual side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. Oxford went into the race leading 24–22 in the event overall. In total, eight rowers who were participating had previous Boat Race experience. Umpired by former Oxford rower Frank Willan, pre-race favourites Oxford won by half-a-length in a time of 21 minutes 48 seconds. It was Oxford's narrowest winning margin since the 1867 race.

The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the boat clubs of University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities, as of 2014 it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having beaten Cambridge by one length in the previous year's race, and held the overall lead, with 24 victories to Cambridge's 22 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).

Cambridge were coached by Arthur Middleton Hutchinson (who had rowed for the Light Blues in the 1881 and 1882 races) while Oxford's coach was R. C. Lehmann, former president of the Cambridge Union Society and captain of the 1st Trinity Boat Club. Although Lehmann had rowed in the trials eights for Cambridge, he was never selected for the Blue boat.

The umpire for the race for the third year in a row was Frank Willan who won the event four consecutive times, rowing for Oxford in the 1866, 1867, 1868 and 1869 races.

The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 3.75 lb (77.7 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Cambridge saw four former Blues return to the boat, in Gilbert Francklyn, Edmund Towers Fison, John Friend Rowlatt and Cambridge University Boat Club president Gerard Elin. Oxford's crew contained four rowers with Boat Race experience, including Guy Nickalls who was rowing in his fourth consecutive race, this year alongside his brother Vivian. The Dark Blues also featured cox John Pemberton Heywood-Lonsdale for the third time in a row. 

Four of the Oxford crew were studying at Magdalen College while five of the Cambridge crew had matriculated to Trinity Hall. Two rowers were registered as non-British, F. Wilkinson for Oxford and Edward Wason Lord for Cambridge both hailed from Australia. Wilkinson was forced to leave the Oxford crew during practice as he suffered from influenza; he was considered sufficiently fit to return to the crew but, according to Drinkwater, "never found his real form again".

Oxford were pre-race favourites, and won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge. The race commenced at 11:09 a.m., in a northerly wind, and despite being outrated by Cambridge, the Dark Blues took an early lead and were a quarter of a length ahead as the crews passed Craven Steps. Just before the Mile Post, Oxford's lead was around half a length, but Cambridge pushed on to take the lead by Hammersmith Bridge. Oxford responded and held a marginal lead as the crews passed The Doves pub, and the boats exchanged the lead several times along Chiswick Reach.

The Dark Blues took the lead and were three-quarters of a length up at Barnes Bridge. Elin increased Cambridge's stroke rate; Charles Kent, the Oxford stroke responded and although the bend in the river favoured the Dark Blues, Cambridge closed the gap. However, it was too late to stop Oxford taking the victory. The Dark Blues passed the finishing post with a half-length lead in a time of 21 minutes 48 seconds. It was their second consecutive victory and the narrowest winning margin since the 1867 race, taking the overall record to 25–22 in Oxford's favour.

The 51st Boat Race took place on 22 March 1894. The Boat Race is an annual side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. Oxford went into the race leading by 27–22 in the event and of the eighteen participants, half had previous Boat Race experience. Umpired by former rower Frank Willan, Oxford won the race by three-and-a-half lengths in a time of 21 minutes 39 seconds, for their fifth consecutive victory in the event. It was the largest margin of victory since the 1883 race.

The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the boat clubs of University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").

The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities, as of 2014 it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having beaten Cambridge by one-and-a-quarter lengths in the previous year's race, and held the overall lead, with 27 victories to Cambridge's 22 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).

Oxford were coached by William Fletcher (who rowed for Oxford in the 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1893 races), R. C. Lehmann (former president of the Cambridge Union Society and captain of the 1st Trinity Boat Club; although he had rowed in the trials eights for Cambridge, he was never selected for the Blue boat) and Douglas McLean (an Oxford Blue five times between 1883 and 1887). Cambridge's coach was Charles William Moore (who represented Cambridge in the 1881, 1882, 1883 and 1884 races).

The umpire for the race for the sixth year in a row was Frank Willan who won the event four consecutive times, rowing for Oxford in the 1866, 1867, 1868 and 1869 races.

The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 3 lb (77.3 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Cambridge's crew contained four rowers who had previously participated in the Boat Race, including Lionel Arthur Edward Ollivant, Charles Thurstan Fogg-Elliiot, Robert Orme Kerrison and Trevor Gwyn Elliot Lewis. Oxford saw five members of the previous year's crew return, including Charles Murray Pitman and Hugh Benjamin Cotton who were rowing in their third consecutive Boat Race. The Dark Blues also saw the introduction of William Burton Stewart, a rugby union Blue who Drinkwater described as "a useful heavy-weight" who had rowed for Brasenose and Leander Club at the Henley Royal Regatta. Eleven of the sixteen rowers were educated at Eton College. All of the competitors in the race were registered as British.

Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge. The umpire was accompanied on his launch by the Duke of York (later to become King George V). Despite a poor tide, weather conditions were good and the race commenced at 9:12 a.m. Rating 41 strokes per minute, Cambridge took a brief early lead but were soon overhauled by Oxford who led by half a length by the Mile Post.

Taking advantage of the bend in the river, the Dark Blues continued to pull away and were clear of Cambridge by the time the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge. At The Doves pub, Oxford were more than a length clear, and had extended that to three lengths clear by Chiswick and five by Barnes Bridge. Relaxing down to a paddle, Oxford passed the finishing post with a three-and-a-half length advantage, in a winning time of 21 minutes 39 seconds. It was Oxford's fifth consecutive win, was their largest margin of victory since the 1883 race, and took the overall record in the event to 28–22 in their favour.

The 74th Boat Race took place on 1 April 1922. Held annually, the Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the previous year's race, and had the significantly heavier crew. Four of the Oxford crew and three of the Cambridge crew had previous Boat Race experience. In this year's race, umpired by former rower Frederick I. Pitman, Cambridge won by four-and-a-half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 27 seconds. It was Cambridge's fourth consecutive victory, the largest winning margin since 1914 and the fastest winning time since 1911.

The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide. Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1921 race by one length, while Oxford led overall with 39 victories to Cambridge's 33 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).

Oxford's coaches were George Drinkwater who had rowed for Oxford in the 1902 and 1903 races, E. D. Horsfall (who had rowed in the three races prior to the First World War) and R. P. P. Rowe who had rowed four times between 1889 and 1892. Cambridge were coached by H. Peake (who had participated in the Peace Regattas of 1919), Sidney Swann (who had rowed in the four races from 1911 to 1914) and G. L. Thomson. For the fourteenth year the umpire was old Etonian Frederick I. Pitman who rowed for Cambridge in the 1884, 1885 and 1886 races.

The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 11 lb (81.0 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Five of the Oxford crew had previous Boat Race experience, including cox W. H. Porritt who was making his third appearance in the event. Cambridge's crew also included five individuals who had previously represented the university, including Humphrey Playford and P. H. G. H-S. Hartley who were rowing for the Light Blues for the third consecutive year. Two of the participants were silver medallists in the men's eight at the 1920 Summer Olympics: Oxford's Sebastian Earl, and Guy Oliver Nickalls. All of the participants in the race were registered as British.

Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge. In a light wind and with a good tide, umpire Pitman commenced the race at 4:40 p.m., which resulted in a false start, with Cambridge being released from their stakeboat too soon. After the restart, Cambridge were clear by the Mile Post and two lengths ahead of Oxford by the time the crews passed under Hammersmith Bridge.

According to Oxford's bow, George Drinkwater, Cambridge were "rowing well within themselves" and passed the finishing post four and a half lengths ahead in a time of 19 minutes 27 seconds. It was their fourth consecutive victory, the largest winning margin since the 1914 race and the fastest winning time since the 1911 race. The win took the overall record in the event to 39–34 in Oxford's favour.

The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1923 race by three-quarters of a length, and led overall with 40 victories to Cambridge's 34 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).

Oxford were coached by G. C. Bourne who had rowed for the university in the 1882 and 1883 races, Harcourt Gilbey Gold (Dark Blue president for the 1900 race and four-time Blue) and E. D. Horsfall (who had rowed in the three races prior to the First World War). Cambridge's coaches were Francis Escombe, P. Haig-Thomas (four-time Blue who had rowed between 1902 and 1905) and David Alexander Wauchope (who had rowed in the 1895 race). For the sixteenth year the umpire was Old Etonian Frederick I. Pitman who rowed for Cambridge in the 1884, 1885 and 1886 races.

Cambridge had few former Blues to call upon and despite measles striking at least one of the crew down, their rowing style was described by author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater as "harmoniously together". Conversely, Oxford's crew was experienced yet a "lack of uniformity" in early training evolved into a crew with "a turn of such extraordinary speed that being was as much as four to one on Oxford".

The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 5.5 lb (78.5 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Cambridge saw a single rower return with Boat Race experience in their number six T. D. A. Collet. Conversely, Oxford's crew included six individuals who had represented the Dark Blues in the event, including bow P. C. Mallam who was making his fourth consecutive appearance. Oxford's American stroke W. P. Mellen was the only non-British participant registered in the event, having been educated at the Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts.

Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford. Umpire Pitman started the race in bright sunshine and a light breeze at 2:23 p.m. Oxford took a brief lead, out-rating their opponents significantly in the first minute, but by the time the crews passed the Mile Post, the Light Blues were nearly a quarter of a length ahead. As both boats passed under Hammersmith Bridge, Cambridge had extended their lead and were clear of Oxford, despite rowing two strokes per minute slower.

Even though the Dark Blues made a spurt, Cambridge pulled away and were three lengths ahead by Chiswick Steps. According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater, "from here they had it all their own way to the finish". Cambridge passed the finishing post four and a half lengths ahead, in a time of 18 minutes 41 seconds, the fastest winning time since the 1911 race and the second fastest time in the history of the event. It was their fourth win in five years and took the overall record in the event to 40–35 in Oxford's favour.

The Boat Race 1932

The 84th Boat Race took place on 19 March 1932. Held annually, the Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. The race was umpired by former Oxford rower Harcourt Gilbey Gold on a shortened because of repairs to Putney Bridge. Cambridge won by five lengths, the largest winning margin for three years, in a time of 19 minutes 11 seconds, their ninth consecutive victory. The win equalled the record victorious streaks of Oxford between 1861 and 1869, and 1890 and 1898, and took the overall record to 43–40 in their favour.

The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide. Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1931 race by two-and-a-half lengths, and led overall with 42 victories to Oxford's 40 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).

Oxford were coached by H. R. Barker (who rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1908 and 1909 races) and John Houghton Gibbon (who had participated in the 1899 and 1900 races, and umpired the previous year's race). Cambridge's coaches were F. E. Hellyer (who had rowed for the Light Blues in the 1910 and 1911 races), J. A. MacNabb (rowed in the 1924 race) and Peter Haig-Thomas (four-time Blue for Cambridge between 1902 and 1905). The race was umpired by Harcourt Gilbey Gold, former Dark Blue president for the 1900 race and four-time Blue, rowing in each race between 1896 and 1899.

The start of this year's race was moved to the University of London Boat Club, approximately further upstream. After discussion between the umpire, the two boat club presidents, the coaches Haig-Thomas and Gibbons, and a representative of the Port of London Authority, the course was shortened to avoid potential eddies around temporary buttresses erected by Putney Bridge which was undergoing repair. As noted by former Oxford rower E. P. Evans, writing in "The Manchester Guardian", "no comparisons of times with previous races can be made, because the points on the course will be different". It was the first time since the 1863 race that the event was not conducted between the University Stone and Mortlake.

Cambridge were considered to be favourites to win the race: according to Evans, they had "a command of their boat" although Oxford had "acquired more 'drive' from the coaching of Colonel J. H. Gibbon". The rowing correspondent for "The Times" stated that the Cambridge crew were "the steadiest and best combined crew since that of 1924", while Oxford were "not remarkable for good form" and "not very well together in their blade nor very long nor very steady."

The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 2.75 lb (77.3 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Oxford saw four rowers return to the crew with Boat Race experience. Cambridge's crew also contained four participants who had taken part in the event previously, including bow David Haig-Thomas and number six Harold Rickett. Two participants in the race were registered as non-British, both of whom rowed for Cambridge: Lewis Luxton and William Sambell were Australian.

Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford. Weather conditions were favourable, with bright sunshine, little wind and calm water, and umpire Gold started the race at 10:30 a.m. Oxford made the quicker start, marginally out-rating the Light Blues and led by a quarter-length by the end of the Fulham Wall. They extended this lead to one third of a length by the time the crews passed the Mile Post. Cambrdige increased their stroke rate and drew level by the Crab Tree pub, and spurting at Harrods Furniture Depository they led by half a length.

As the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge, Cambridge drew clear and held a two-length lead by the Doves pub. In rough water along Chiswick Reach, Oxford struggled and at Chiswick Steps they were eleven seconds behind the Light Blues. Despite a spurt from the Dark Blues, Cambridge passed under Barnes Bridge five lengths ahead. They held that lead to pass the finishing post in a time of 19 minutes 11 seconds, the largest winning margin since the 1929 race. It was their ninth consecutive victory and the first time in the history of the race that Cambridge had equalled the successful winning streaks of Oxford between 1861 and 1869, and 1890 and 1898.

The Boat Race 1952

The 98th Boat Race took place on 29 March 1952. Held annually, the Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. In a race umpired by former Cambridge rower Kenneth Payne, Oxford won by a canvas in a time of 20 minutes 23 seconds. At no point during the contest was there clear water between the boats. The race, described as "one of the closest fought of all time", was their second win in seven years and took the overall record in the event to 53–44 in Cambridge's favour.

The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). First held in 1829, the race takes place on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide. Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1951 race by a three-and-a-half lengths, and had won the previous five races. They led overall with 53 victories to Oxford's 43 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).

Oxford's coaches were A. J. M. Durand (who had rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1920 race), Hugh "Jumbo" Edwards (who rowed for Oxford in 1926 and 1930), R. D. Hill (who rowed in the 1940 wartime race) and J. H. Page. Cambridge were coached by C. B. M. Lloyd (three-time Blue between 1949 and 1951), Roy Meldrum (a coach for Lady Margaret Boat Club), James Owen and Harold Rickett (who rowed three times between 1930 and 1932). The race was umpired for the third time by the former British Olympian Kenneth Payne, who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races.

Although Cambridge had arrived at Putney as clear favourites to win, Oxford's improvements during the build-up to the race had shortened their odds: as the rowing correspondent in "The Manchester Guardian" suggested, "anything might happen". The rowing correspondent for "The Times" reported that Cambridge were "quoted as even" but would "still start [the] race as favourites". Moreover, the crews were "extraordinarily evenly matched, but Oxford have a very good chance of breaking the run of Cambridge wins."

The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 11.5 lb (81.2 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Oxford's crew contained three rowers with Boat Race experience including their stroke Chris Davidge who was making his third appearance in the event. Cambridge saw three participants return, including cox John Hinde. Oxford's number six Ken Keniston was the only participant registered as non-British; the former Harvard University rower was from the United States.

Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Oxford. The weather was inclement, with gale-force winds and snow disrupting the race, and limiting the number of spectators lining the banks of the Thames to a few thousand. Umpire Payne started the race at 3:15 p.m. Cambridge made the cleaner start in the rough conditions, and held a quarter-length lead at the Dukes' Head pub. Despite making a number of spurts, the Light Blues could not pull away from Oxford, the Dark Blues' stroke maintaining a higher stroke rate to keep in touch. Keeping to more sheltered conditions yet in slower water, Cambridge passed the Mile Post with a lead of half a length.

With the bend in the river beginning to favour Oxford, the lead was slowly eroded until both boats passed nearly level below Hammersmith Bridge. Alongside Chiswick Eyot, the Dark Blues were almost half-a-length ahead but not gaining further. Cambridge's cox Hinde pushed the Oxford boat towards the centre of the river and as they passed under Barnes Bridge the Dark Blue lead was down to less than a quarter of a length. Oxford won by a canvas (approximately ) in a time of 20 minutes 23 seconds, the narrowest margin of victory since 1877, and their first win in six attempts. At no point during the course of the race did either boat have a clear water advantage over their opponent. The rowing correspondent for "The Manchester Guardian" described the race as "one of the closest fought of all time", while Ian Thomson, writing in "The Observer" suggested it was "one of the most exciting races ever rowed."

Gendarmerie of Haiti

The Gendarmerie of Haiti ( ), also known as the "Haitian Constabulary", was a collaborationist gendarmerie raised by the United States during its occupation of Haiti in the early 20th century. Established in late 1915, the gendarmerie was operational from 1916 until 1928, during which time it was Haiti's only military force, earning a reputation for active interference in civilian government that may have set the stage for the future politicization of Haiti's armed forces.

From 1918 to 1920 the Gendarmerie of Haiti fought the Second Caco War, one of the so-called "Banana Wars". It was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti in 1928, forming the nucleus of what would evolve into the modern Haitian army.

The United States invaded Haiti in the last half of 1915. The invasion followed the violation of the French embassy in Port-au-Prince by a mob that seized Haitian president Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, who had earlier fled to the legation owing to popular unrest, and "mutilated his body in the street." Admiral William Banks Caperton, leading the initial landing force, declared martial law and ordered the Haitian army dissolved. In the absence of functioning police, U.S. Marines assumed civilian law enforcement duties, but occupation authorities had already set into motion plans to raise a local police force with the Haitian–American Convention, obligating Haiti's American-established interim government to "create without delay an efficient constabulary, urban and rural."

The Gendarmerie of Haiti was formally established in December 1915. It became operational in February of the following year, with Smedley Butler (then a Marine Corps major) assuming the post of commandant of gendarmes and the Haitian rank of major general. Officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted personnel of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps were initially placed in command of the force, holding officer commissions from the Haitian government while retaining their United States commissions and enlistment status. The process for commissioning of officers was set out in the Haitian–American Convention:

Early attempts to establish an officer candidate school to train an indigenous officer corps from among Haiti's educated upper class failed due to a reluctance among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American occupation, and by the perception that the methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.

The gendarmerie was equipped initially with the Krag–Jørgensen bolt-action rifle. Uniforms were surplus Marine Corps uniforms with plain buttons in lieu of buttons embossed with the Marine Corps Eagle, Globe, and Anchor.

The gendarmerie quickly evolved into the cornerstone of the United States occupation, and gendarmerie officers had practical control over the U.S. client government of Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave; one visiting American observer noted that: "the actual running of the government comes pretty near being vested in General Butler and his young colonels and majors." On one occasion, the Haitian ambassador to the United States balked at the idea of signing a Butler-inspired compact that would give the gendarmerie control of the nation's postal service. Butler forced the issue by placing an armed guard in President Dartiguenave's office, with instructions to compel Dartiguenave to telegraph the ambassador with orders to sign the agreement "or else".

Even at the local level, junior officers were virtual "potentates", having not only military and police authority in their jurisdictions, but also being responsible to sit as judges in civil and criminal cases, to collect taxes, to manage prisons, to enforce weights and measures, to register vital statistics, and to audit the financial records of municipal governments. Interference by gendarmerie officers into local governmental affairs prompted Solon Ménos, the Haitian ambassador to the United States, to file a complaint with the U.S. State Department, observing that: "the American officers of the Haitian gendarmerie  ... have extended their powers for the communal councils to such an extent that they wish to act as administrators of the commune and not rest within their powers."

Some gendarmerie actions, including the enforcement of government press censorship, and the use of conscripted civilian labor for infrastructure development, have been cited as factors leading to the Second Caco War (1918–20), a rebellion by Haitians against the occupation.

The conflict erupted on October 17, 1918, with an attack by 100 rebel "cacos" on a gendarmerie barracks. The assault was repulsed with significant loss of life, and commanding officer Lieutenant Patrick Kelly earned Haiti's Médaille militaire and a promotion to captain for his role in the defense of the barracks. A wave of small-scale rebel attacks on isolated gendarmerie outposts followed; over a six-month period in 1919, the gendarmerie reported more than 130 engagements with "cacos".

The 1919 Battle of Port-au-Prince saw the first major action between gendarmes and rebels, and after-action dispatches reported the force acquitted itself well. The day following the Battle of Port-au-Prince, a contingent of 12 gendarmes under Lt. Kemp C. Christian overran the "cacos" base camp, killing 30 rebels and capturing their only field gun. Nonetheless, during this period, the gendarmerie was largely dependent on the U.S. Marine Corps to provide the "muscle" for its operations, though by the end of the rebellion gendarmerie units were beginning to operate independently. By 1919 an experimental gendamerie unit had been raised under the designation "Provisional Company A". Unlike the bulk of gendarmerie units, which garrisoned towns, Provisional Company A was a mobile force organized to conduct preventative patrols. Chesty Puller, then a gendarmerie officer, was given the captaincy of Provisional Company A. The company's executive officer, Lt. Augustin Brunot, was one of the first indigenous Haitians to receive a commission.

By the time the Second Caco War ended in 1920, 75 gendarmes had been killed in action.

Following the war, the U.S. Senate's Select Committee on Haiti and Santo Domingo convened a series of hearings to investigate the behavior of gendarmes and marines during the conflict. Several indigenous Haitian gendarmes who were asked to submit testimony to the hearing alleged that gendarmerie officers had executed prisoners. One gendarme, Eucher Jean, stated that:

Despite the sometimes gruesome testimony it was generally believed the hearings were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, both of whom had been acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the hearings. A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable.

Haiti was represented at the 1924 Olympics by a rifle team composed entirely of indigenous gendarmes. The team won the bronze medal in the team free rifle event, which was the nation's first-ever Olympic medal. The team's expenses were paid for from a voluntary fund, with all of the nation's gendarmes contributing five percent of their salary for five months to finance it.

In 1927 the gendarmerie was reporting a strength of 160 officers, 2,522 gendarmes and 551 rural policemen. Even at this late date only about 40 of the officers were Haitian, the majority being United States Marines and sailors.

In 1928, the gendarmerie was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti and became the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had a long tradition of military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.

M9 half-track

The M9 half-track was a half-track produced by International Harvester in the United States during World War II for lend-lease supply to the Allies. It was designed to provide a similar vehicle to the M2 half-track car. It had the same body and chassis as the M5 half-track (also built by International Harvester for lend-lease) but had the same stowage and radio fit as the M2 half-track.

The M9 served for a significant amount of time. Three thousand five-hundred were produced by the end of World War II. It was used during World War II, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Vietnam War, the Six-Day War, and the Yom Kippur War. It had been used by eleven different countries by the end of its service.

The United States adopted half-tracks in large numbers as they could be built more quickly and cheaply by civilian vehicle producers than vehicles from the established armored vehicle manufacturers. The M2 half-track car had first been intended as an artillery tractor, but was also used for carrying the machine gun squads of armored infantry regiments and for reconnaissance units until faster and better-armed M8 Greyhound armored cars were available.

In order to supply U.S. allies, much more production was required than was possible through the firms producing the M2 (and the larger M3 half-track). International Harvester (IH) could produce half-tracks, but some differences had to be accepted due to different manufacturing methods and components. This led to IH producing for lend-lease the M5 half-track and M9 as equivalents for the M3 and M2 respectively.

The M9 used the same chassis and mechanical components as the M5. It was laid out to provide similar stowage, access to the radios from the inside, rear doors, and a pedestal machine gun mount as with the M2. The M9A1 variant of the M9 matched the improvements made to the M2, M3, and M5, changing to ring mount machine gun mount and three pintle machine gun mounts.

As with the M5, due to the lack of face-hardened armor, homogenous armor was used. Although thicker, it gave less protection and could be penetrated by armor-piercing rifle bullets from rather than . The armor also made the vehicle heavier, though the performance was essentially similar.

The M9 started production in August 1942, at IH. The M9 and M9A1 were manufactured en masse and 2,026 were produced in total. According to American military historian and defense specialist Steven Zaloga, 2,026 M9s and 1,407 M9A1s were produced in 1943.

The M9 was used in World War II, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, and many other conflicts. The production of M9s was leased to other countries, like most other IH half-tracks produced in World War II. This M9A1 was leased to both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, with the latter providing it to other countries in the British Commonwealth.

The M9 was used by many countries but not the United States, as there was sufficient M2 and M3 production for U.S. needs. The UK leased some half-tracks to Free France and other governments-in-exile. The Soviet Union received them directly. Following World War II, the second-hand market was a source of supply for some countries, including Israel. M9 half-tracks were provided by the U.S. under the Military Aid Program to the following countries (except the People's Republic of China, which operated captured ones from the Republic of China during the Chinese Civil War and received more from the Soviet Union afterwards):

Letitia Woods Brown

Letitia Woods Brown (October 24, 1915 – August 3, 1976) was an African American researcher and historian. Earning a master's degree in 1935 from Ohio State University and a Ph.D. in 1966 from Harvard University, she served as a researcher and historian for over four decades and became one of the first black woman to earn a PhD from Harvard University in history. As a teacher, she started her career in Macon County, Alabama between 1935 and 1936. Later in 1937, she became Tuskegee Institute's instructor in history but left in 1940. Between 1940 and 1945 she worked at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Tennessee as a tutor. From 1968 to 1971, she served as a Fulbright lecturer at Monash University and Australia National University followed by a period in 1971 working as a consultant at the Federal Executive Institute. Between 1971 and 1976 she served as a history professor in the African-American faculty of George Washington University and became the first full-time black member. She also served as a primary consultant for the Schlesinger Library’s Black Women Oral History project during the course of her professional career. Aside from teaching history, Brown wrote and contributed to books on Washington DC such as "Washington from Banneker to Douglas, 1791 – 1870" and "Washington in the New Era, 1870 – 1970".

Letitia Woods Brown ("née" Letitia Christine Woods) was born on October24, 1915, to Evadne Clark Adam Woods and Matthew Woods in Tuskegee, Alabama, U.S. One of three daughters, Letitia was the second child. The Woodses were a middle-class family; both parents worked as teachers at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), an industrial college established by Booker T. Washington. Matthew Woods was educated at the Tuskegee Institute. Letitia's mother Evadne Woods was one of twelve children born to Lewis Adams and Theodosia Evadne Clark. Her father Lewis Adams was a former slave who became a Tuskegee Normal School trustee and a commissioner in 1881. They all served as educators throughout the southern USA.

Letitia Woods Brown attended Tuskegee Institute, as her father had. She graduated with a bachelor of science degree in 1935, during the middle of the Great Depression. While she continued her education, she briefly served as a teacher in the Macon County, Alabama segregated school system, where she taught 3rd and 4th grade in 1935 and 1936. She once stated, "The rural black school in the segregated post-depression era was deprived by any standard. There were never enough books and the teacher had to provide her own chalk, paper, pencils...". She subsequently obtained a Master of Arts degree in history from Ohio State University in 1937. It was a time when women of African American ancestry were unlikely to continue higher education and pursue degrees. After graduating from Ohio State, Brown and a group of Ohio State University students traveled to Haiti to pursue academic knowledge about Caribbean history and literature. She later wrote, "That trip was my first sally forth to see the world".

On her return from Haiti, Brown moved to Alabama in 1937 and worked at the Tuskegee Institute as a history teacher until 1940. In 1940, she joined LeMoyne-Owen College as a history teacher after a move from Alabama to Memphis, Tennessee. She continued teaching at LeMoyne-Owen College until 1945. Brown faced the same problem as most black educators during that era, in that they were offered appointments to teaching positions in higher education only in historically African American universities and colleges. She returned briefly in 1945 to Ohio State University to take additional classes in Eastern history and geography.

To seek a PhD degree in history, Brown moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to attend Harvard University where she met Theodore Edward Brown. The couple married in 1947 and moved to her husband's hometown, Harlem.

They moved again to Mount Vernon, New York where she worked at the local health and welfare council. Brown's efforts in the election campaign to elect an African-American proved successful and Harold Wood was elected to the Westchester County Board of Supervisors. She wrote, "At one point the plan we projected for electing a black to the County Board of Supervisors sounded so convincing we decided we really ought to try it... Harold Wood won the election to become the first back to serve on the Westchester County Board of Supervisors".

The family again relocated in 1956 to Washington, DC. There she served at the Bureau of Technical Assistance as an economist. While living in Washington, her interest in the African American history of the District of Columbia grew. In later years, the topic became a major part of Brown's lectures and research. During her course for a doctorate at Harvard, Brown taught at the university, first as a teacher of social science and later of history, from 1961 to 1970. She was later appointed an associate professor. In addition to teaching and researching for her doctorate dissertation, Brown and her husband trained the earliest group of volunteers for the Peace Corps in preparation for a 1961 deployment in Ghana.

At the age of 51, in 1966 Brown completed her PhD history course 18 years after she started, to become one of the first African American woman to obtain a PhD from Harvard University in history.

In 1968 Brown served as a Fulbright lecturer at Australian National University and Monash University in Australia. Brown travelled to every part of southern Asia and southern Europe including Singapore, Jaipur, Istanbul, France and Italy before returning to America. On her return to the U.S. in 1971 she became a professor at George Washington University in the American Studies Department. Brown was the only black faculty member to serve full-time. She remained a member of George Washington University until her death in 1976. In 1972, Brown travelled again, this time to African cities which include Gao, Cairo, Segou, Marrakesh, Timbuktu, Fez, Ibandan, Benin, Axum, Kumasi and Luxor.
Brown joined the American Historical Association committee on her return and served there until 1973. Her efforts helped to establish the Columbia Historical Society of Washington DC in 1973.
Mastering the use of oral history, she also served in the Schlesinger Library’s Black Women Oral History project at Radcliffe College as a primary consultant.

Apart from serving as a teacher and researcher, Brown wrote and contributed to several books on Washington, DC during her last years. Some of her books are:

Brown married Theodore Edward Brown in 1947 and settled briefly in his hometown, Harlem. She met him while she was pursuing her doctorate in history from Harvard University. Theodore Brown was a doctoral student in Harvard University in the field of economics. He later became an economist.

They had two children: Lucy Evadne Brown was born in 1948 and Theodore Edward Brown Jr. followed in 1951.

After a career of more than four decades, Brown died at home aged 60 on August 3, 1976 in Washington, DC after battling cancer.

Professor of philosophy at George Washington University, Roderick S. French said at the memorial service held at National Cathedral's Bethlehem Chapel on August 7, 1976 that:

Following her death in 1976, the Association of Black Women Historical Society under Nell Irvin Painter's presidency established an award in her name, the Letitia Woods Brown Memorial Book Award in 1983 to honor scholars whose publications in the field of African-American Women's history are the best examples. An annual lecture in history at The Historical Society of Washington, DC was named "The Letitia Woods Brown Lecture". The Letitia Woods Brown Fellowship was also established by George Washington University in the field of African American history and culture.

In November 2013, George Washington University organized the Letitia Woods Brown Memorial Lecture to celebrate the memory of Brown in the Jack Morton Auditorium. The ceremony was free and open to the public. Among others, Steven Knapp, current president of George Washington University was present at the lecture. During the lecture Knapp described Brown as "the first full-time African American professor at George Washington, a scholar of the history of the District of Columbia and a tireless advocate for the preservation of the city's heritage".

<doc id="44950518" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44950518" title="Italian cruiser Marco Polo">
Italian cruiser Marco Polo

Marco Polo was an armored cruiser built for the Royal Italian Navy ("Regia Marina") in the 1890s, the first of her type in Italian service. The ship spent the bulk of her career deployed in the Far East. Between deployments she participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12 during which she caused a diplomatic incident with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After that affair "Marco Polo" was sent to Libya where she bombarded the towns of Homs, and Zuara and the defenses of the Dardanelles. In between these operations, the ship provided naval gunfire support to the Royal Italian Army in Libya. Due to her age, "Marco Polo" did not play a significant role in World War I, serving as an accommodation ship in Venice until she began conversion into a troopship in 1917. After a series of renamings in 1920–21, the ship was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and subsequently sold for scrap.

"Marco Polo" was begun as an improved protected cruiser, but she was modified while under construction into an armored cruiser, the first such ship in Italian service. The ship had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of . She had a beam of and a draft of . "Marco Polo" displaced at normal load, and about at deep load. The ship had a complement of 22 officers and 372 enlisted men.

She was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was supplied by four Scotch marine boilers and their exhausts were trunked into a pair of funnels amidships. Rated at , her engines were designed to give "Marco Polo" a speed of , but the ship only reached a speed of during her sea trials even though the engines produced . She had a cruising radius of about at a speed of .

"Marco Polo"s main armament consisted of six 40-caliber guns in single mounts. One of these guns was each mounted at the bow and stern and the remaining four at the corners of the central citadel in armored casemates. Ten 40-caliber guns served as the ship's secondary armament. They were all mounted on the broadside, four in unprotected embrasures in the hull sides and the other six on the upper deck protected by gun shields. For defense against torpedo boats, the ship carried nine quick-firing (QF) Hotchkiss guns and two QF Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also equipped with five torpedo tubes.

The ship was protected by a armored belt that only protected the middle of her hull. The upper strake of armor was also 100 mm thick and protected just the middle of the ship, up to the height of the upper deck. The armored deck was thick. The armor of the conning tower and the gun shields were both thick.

"Marco Polo", named after the eponymous explorer, was laid down on 1 July 1890 at the Royal Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia. The ship was launched on 27 October 1892 and completed on 21 July 1894. She visited Candia (now Heraklion), Crete, and Piraeus, Greece, in May 1897 before departing for the Far East on 26 January 1898. In May 1898, "Marco Polo" sailed up China′s Yangtze River to make port visits at Nanking and Hankow before returning to Shanghai in July 1898. She visited Japan from August to November 1898 and then steamed to Shanghai, where she remained until August 1899. On 8 March 1899, while "Marco Polo" was at Shanghai, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vice Admiral Felice Napoleone Canevaro, ordered the protected cruiser "Elba" and her to occupy China′s Sanmen Bay (known as "San-Mun Bay" to the Italians) in a botched attempt to force China to grant Italy a lease there similar to the lease the German Empire had secured in 1898 at Kiaochow Bay, but countermanded the order when he discovered that the United Kingdom would not support an Italian use of force.

"Marco Polo" departed Shanghai on 27 August 1899 and arrived in Naples on 20 October 1899. She departed for China in October 1901 and remained there until February 1903. A year later, she began her third tour there in March 1904 and did not leave China until 14 January 1907. En route home the ship visited Zanzibar, Mogadishu, Italian Somaliland, and Massawa, Eritrea before arriving at Taranto on 26 April. "Marco Polo" was rearmed in 1911 and her armament was reduced to six 152 mm, four 120 mm, six 57 mm, and two 37 mm guns. One torpedo tube was also removed during this refit.

When the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12 began on 29 September 1911, "Marco Polo" was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She was quickly transferred, however, to the command of Rear-Admiral Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, Inspector of Torpedo Boats. His command was deployed in the Adriatic Sea and was patrolling the area for Ottoman ships. "Marco Polo" and two destroyers stopped an Austro-Hungarian ship on 5 October in the bay at San Giovanni di Medua, Albania, and when they sent a boat to board the merchant ship, Ottoman coastal artillery began firing at the boat. The Italian ships returned fire for 45 minutes and silenced the guns after nearly exhausting their ammunition. The incident prompted a diplomatic protest by Austria-Hungary and Italy ceased its operations against the Ottomans in Albania. "Marco Polo" was then transferred to the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron, operating off the Libyan coast.

On 17 October, she arrived at Homs to support Italian forces attempting to occupy the town and bombarded it after the Ottoman commander refused to surrender. Bad weather prevented any landings until 21 October and the ship continued to provide fire support for the Italian troops. "Marco Polo" was tasked to provide fire support for the Royal Italian Army and remained at Homs after the bulk of the fleet returned to Italy to refit in December. In early April 1912, the ship, together with the armored cruiser bombarded Zuara as a distraction while the army made an unopposed landing away. About a week later, she rejoined the 4th Division as it, and the bulk of the Italian fleet, sailed east in a futile search for the Ottoman fleet in the Aegean Sea. "Marco Polo" joined the rest of the fleet in desultorily bombarding the defenses of the entrance to the Dardanelles on 18 April. The ship then returned to Libya where she resumed her previous task of providing fire support for the army. In June she supported the operation to capture Misrata and finally returned home on 16 July.

"Marco Polo" departed Taranto on 25 February 1913 for her fourth deployment to the Far East. When World War I began in August 1914, she was in Kobe, Japan and the Italian declaration of neutrality on 2 August simplified the problems faced by the Allies in the Far East. The ship departed Shanghai on 7 December and was diverted to Hodeidah, Yemen, en route and finally reached Naples on 4 March 1915. Thoroughly obsolete by the time Italy declared war on the Central Powers in May 1915, "Marco Polo" was used as an accommodation ship at Venice; among those personnel housed aboard were the crews of the British submarines operating there from October 1915 through May 1917. The ship began conversion into a troop transport at the Venetian Arsenal in 1917. This required the removal of her armor, the replacement of her armament with some guns and internal modifications to suit her new role. She was recommissioned with the new name of "Cortellazo" on 4 April 1918. The ship was rechristened "Europa" on 1 October 1920, discarded on 16 January 1921, but simultaneously rechristened "Volta", then discarded on 5 January 1922. She was sold for scrap.

St. Elmo (1910 Thanhouser film)

St. Elmo is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company. The scenario was adapted by Lloyd Lonergan from Augusta Jane Evans's 1866 novel of the same name. Frank H. Crane and Anna Rosemond play the leading roles in the simplified plot that was reliant on inter-titles to tell the story. The film follows St. Elmo who is engaged to his cousin Agnes, being betrayed by his friend Dick Hammond who has an affair with Agnes. St. Elmo challenges and kills Hammond in a duel. A young girl, Edna witnesses the duel and leads Agnes and the sheriff off the trail. St. Elmo disappears and returns five years later to woo Edna. She rejects then accepts his affections only to stop him from committing suicide. The production was met with mixed reviews by critics, but was successful. The film is presumed lost.

The plot was adapted from Augusta Jane Evans's 1867 novel "St. Elmo". The actual production was greatly shortened for the purposes of conveying the plot of the film. The synopsis in "The Moving Picture World" states: "St. Elmo, a wealthy young man, is betrothed to his cousin Agnes. Dick Hammond, St. Elmo's chum, is studying for the ministry. As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake."


Written in 1866, Augusta Jane Evans domestic novel "St. Elmo" became one of the best-selling novels of the 19th century. Its popularity would spur the creation of popular consumer products, parodies and even the names of several towns. Evans was concerned about how the novel's themes would be portrayed on the stage and did not approve the first script for a "St. Elmo" play until 1909. It is also unknown if Evans was aware of any intention to adapt the novel for the screen. Lloyd Lonergan adapted the play for the Thanhouser Company. "The Book News Monthly" said that Lonergan received a share of interest in the company for his good work in producing the scenario. Lonergan already had a single share of 100 total shares of the company from the initial $10,000 in capital in 1909.

The director of has both been credited to Barry O'Neil and/or Lloyd B. Carleton by film historian Q. David Bowers. It is not known for certain who directed or if both them played a directorial a role in the production. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, "Romeo and Juliet". Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. There is also dispute over the cameraman credit for the film. Bower credits Blair Smith as the cameraman, but the American Film Institute adds that Carl Louis Gregory also could have been the cameraman. Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. Bowers believes that numerous releases were produced with Gregory operating the camera, but the role was uncredited in the 1910 era. Anna Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Rosemond joined in the autumn of 1909 and in their first year of productions. Frank H. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company from 1909. Crane's was the first leading man of the company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.

Bowers notes that St. Elmo was filmed in a mansion built in 1759, but the name and location of the structure is unknown. The actual date of the filming is unknown. During the weeks leading up to the release, a spy for Thomas Edison's production company recorded details surrounding Thanhouser's production, including the filming of Thanhouser's first release, "The Actor's Children". The spy, W. E. Lowenkamp, had a New York State Detective license. Lowenkamp's reports suggest the possibility of filming in a house on March 10, 1910 and the intention to film the following morning, but it is unknown if this was related to "St. Elmo"s filming. Lowenkamp would speak to Edwin Thanhouser's sister in law, Carey L. Hastings, who took him as a real estate salesman was in film. Bower's reprints the report, "The sister-in-law said the house they were using to take pictures would just suit Mr. Thanhouser, so I called a real estate office and gave them the tip so they will try and sell the house to Mr. Thanhouser and cover me." The film also included Gertrude Thanhouser, the wife of Edwin Thanhouser. According to family tradition, she only appeared in this one film.

The single reel drama, approximately 860 ft, was released on March 22, 1910 by the Thanhouser Company. The film was shown in Tennessee, Ohio, Washington, and Pennsylvania. An advertisement in Indiana lists "St. Elmo" in apparent reference to a "great Thanhouser film". Edwin Thanhouser later stated that there were ten copies of the film at first and the films were primarily distributed to the exchanges that had purchased the first work, "The Actor's Children". The desire for "St. Elmo" resulted in the production of fifteen more copies to meet the demand.

Reviews for the film were mixed. "The New York Dramatic Mirror" provided a positive review which praised the ability of the writer to adapt the work to film, but this was diminished slightly because of the films dependence on title-cards. The review also stated that the acting was excellent, but not expressive enough and concluded that the film was "a notable one among the Independent releases". "The Moving Picture World" provided another positive review, praising the adaptation that simplified the plot and found no fault with the production. "The Morning Telegraph" found no fault with the story, but found fault with the excessive use of inter-titles. The reviewer also noted that the only strong scene in the film is the duel scene, but Edna's wanderings made her appear to be insane. The edition of April 16, 1910 of The Moving Picture World provided three testimonials that the film was of excellent quality and one attributed a doubling of patrons because of the film. The film is presumed lost.


The 1910 edition of St. Elmo by Hurst & Company is sometimes marked as having been drawn from a movie. This is incorrect, it was designed to appeal to theater patrons and copyrighted in January 1910. Another 1910 publication by M.A Donahue includes photographs marked as having been produced by Lawrence Co. of Chicago. It does not indicate that it is from the Thanhouser production.

Daddy's Double

Daddy's Double is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Film Corporation. The film focuses on Hal, a young man, who proposes to Sue, his love interest. Her father overhears and becomes furious before whisking his daughter away to a boarding school. Hal and Sue attempt to elope, but it is foiled. Hal then gets an idea to disguise himself as the father and reclaim Sue. The plan works, but the father follows in pursuit. He breaks into the wedding ceremony at the parson's house and sees his double. He then laughs and approves of the marriage. The film was the fourth release by Thanhouser and it was met with favorable reviews by critics. In 2007, a surviving print was released on DVD with a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacher.

At the Post's home, Hal Dunton sits down with his love interest Sue Post, cautiously checking to see if they are alone. Hal then proposes to Sue and in the excitement, her father comes into the room. He is outraged and believes his daughter is too young to be married and promptly makes Hal leave before scolding his daughter. Before departing, Hal meets and pleads with the father as he takes the daughter away by car. The father refuses and Hal is knocked down before the father and daughter depart to a boarding school. The father meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her care, much to Sue's distress.

Whisked away from her home and her beloved, Sue is in despair until Hal appears outside her window with a ladder. The attempted elopement fails when the mistress catches Hal in the act and dismisses him. She awaits Sue to descend and round the corner before halting her and forcing her back inside. The father pulls up to a place of business and Hal, who is walking by, attempts to greet the father. The angry father ignores him, but Hal turns and sees the wigmaker's store next to him. An idea strikes him and he pays a photographer to get a photo of the father on the way out, which further angers him. Hal then sends a message to Sue, that he will come and claim her the following day, disguised as her father.

Hal head to the wigmaker and is disguised as the father. So well is the disguise that the father's chauffeur is convinced and takes Hal to the boarding school. The father quickly exits in time to see his chauffeur drive away and hails a taxi. Hal arrives at the boarding school and the disguise works, claims Sue and drives away. Seconds later the father arrives and confronts the mistress, departing to pursue in a fit of anger. Hal and Sue go to the parson's house to be immediately wed. The father is delayed for a short time by car trouble, but quickly arrives before the two are wed. He bursts in and sees his double and both he and Hal laugh. The father relents and approves the marriage as Hal removes his disguise in front of the stunned Parson.


The scenario was written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. Lonergan was the writer of all three previous productions of the Thanhouser company. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by "The New York Evening World" while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The director of the film is not known for certain, but two Thanhouser directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, "Romeo and Juliet". Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production, but he does credit Blair Smith as the cameraman. The film is composed of 28 shots, 8 titles and 1 insert.

The cast for the film featured Thanhouser's first leading male actor, Frank H. Crane, along with two stage actors, Isabelle Daintry and Fred Santley. Isabelle Daintry has one other known Thanhouser credit, but this marks Fred Santley's only known credit. During this era, the players in the film were not credited and anonymity was the rule.

The one reel drama, approximately 960 feet, was released on Tuesday April 5, 1910. The film would also be released in the United Kingdom on October 16, 1910. The surviving feel reel says the Gaumont Company of London (Gaumont British) had exclusive rights to Thanhouser films outside of the United States. The film was shown across the United States, including theaters in Kansas, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Indiana. One of the last advertisements for the film came three years after its release by the Neosho Picture Show Company of Neosho, Missouri.

The film received positive attention from film critics. "The Morning Telegraph" praised it as the best work from the new Thanhouser Company. "The New York Dramatic Mirror" found it to have good acting which could still be more expressive, but was more indifferent to the use of unnecessary connecting scenes. "The Moving Picture World" stated, in a brief review, that the acting and photography was good.

In 2007, the film was released by Thanhouser Company Film Preservation on a three-disc DVD set along with eleven other surviving Thanhouser films. The surviving print was obtained from the British Film Institute and featured a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacher. According to Silent Era, the archive holds the 35mm nitrate positive, the more stable 35mm safety negative and a 35mm reference positive.

Cupid at the Circus

Cupid at the Circus is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a romance with a storyline focused around a country boy who follows a circus parade to the circus grounds and becomes intent on sneaking into the show. He is discovered, but before he can be ejected, a girl asks her father to buy him a ticket of admission. Thankful, the boy gives her his pocket knife. Years later the two meet again and when he sees her using his pocket knife. He proposes and she accepts. Not too much is known for certain about the production of this film, including the writer, director and photographer credits. The circus scenes were done with special arrangement by Barnum & Bailey. The film was released on May 20, 1910 to favorable reviews. The film is presumed lost.

Though the film is presumed lost, a surviving official synopsis was published in "The Moving Picture World". It states: "Tom Wilk is a poor country lad, living alone with his stepfather, who ill-treats him. Tom leaves his work one day to follow a circus parade. He is fascinated with the wonders of the parade and follows it to the circus grounds, around which he stays all morning, and is finally tempted by his great wish to see the show, to crawl under the tent. He is discovered by a circus guard, and ordered off the ground. A small girl, Lillie Lockwood, and her father come to the circus, and witness Tom's ejection. Urged by his daughter, Lillie's father buys Tom a ticket of admission, giving him his first happy day. In return, Tom gives Lillie, as a keepsake, his most treasured possession, his pocket knife. On returning home, Tom is severely chastised by his step-father, after which he decides to run away. He walks to a neighboring town, and is there engaged as an office boy by Gates, a lawyer. After some years of faithful service, in various capacities, Tom becomes a member of the firm. Lillie obtains a position as a stenographer in their office. She and Tom do not recognize each other, until Tom accidentally sees in her hand the little knife he had given her in the long ago. He declares he had loved her through the years, and has been patiently waiting for her, so the romance that began at the circus finds a happy climax at the altar."


The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it may have been Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by "The New York Evening World" while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. While the director of the film is not known, two Thanhouser directors are possible.

Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production nor does Bowers credit a cameraman. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The two known credits in the film are for the leading players, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company and joined in the autumn of 1909. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company from 1909. Crane's was the first leading man of the company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.

The setting of the film included Barnum and Bailey circus that were shot by a special arrangement with Mr. Barnum and Bailey. The date of the filming is unknown, but the 1910 route of Barnum & Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth indicates that it the circus was in New York between March 24 through April 30. The circus was at Madison Square Garden from March 24 through April 22 and it moved to Brooklyn, New York for April 25 through April 30. The circus would go to Philadelphia, Washington D. C., Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware before moving back up through New Jersey on May 14 through May 18. According to one review in the "Santa Cruz Sentinel", the film showed "...the Barnum and Bailey circus from the time they arrive at the lot until after the show."

The one reel film was released on Friday May 20, 1910. There are different records for the length of the reel. According to Bowers, the film was 975 feet long, but one trade publication listed it as being 940 feet long. The film was advertised in theaters in Kansas, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Minnesota, Indiana, and California. The film was released one day before the Barnum and Bailey tent caught fire in Schenectady, New York. The May 21 fire did not result in injury or loss of life, but was caused an estimated $10,000 in damages, .

The film was met with favorable reviews from critics. "The Morning Telegraph" offers general praise for the good photography and the well-told story. "The Nickelodeon" was equally positive and began to reflect the acting, staging and photography was up to the regular standard of the Thanhouser company. "The New York Dramatic Mirror" offered additional comments on the Thanhouser company's higher standards in their productions, but gave an otherwise positive review that focused on the novelty of the circus scenes.

<doc id="45197818" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45197818" title="Iconic (song)">
Iconic (song)

"Iconic" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Madonna for her thirteenth studio album "Rebel Heart" (2015). It was written by Madonna, Toby Gad, Maureen McDonald, Larry Griffin Jr., Chancelor Bennett, Dacoury Natche and Michael Tucker. "Iconic" was produced by Madonna, Gad, AFSHeeN and Josh Cumbee, while DJ Dahi and Tucher served as additional producers. It features American rapper Chance the Rapper and a spoken intro by American professional boxer Mike Tyson. The song's demo was leaked onto the internet on December 17, 2014, alongside twelve other tracks from the album, with "Iconic" also being rumored as the album's title. Its final version was released on February 9, 2015, with "Hold Tight" and "Joan of Arc", on the iTunes store.

A trap-influenced EDM song, "Iconic" features in its instrumentation "ice-cold" synths, marching drums and "booming" bass, as well as machinic stabs and electronic gears. Lyrically, the song encourages people to take control of their life, to pursue their dreams and to find their own greatness. The song received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised the song's "weird" beat and odd collaboration, recognizing its catchiness. Although, some criticized Tyson's addition and were confused with the song's message. It charted in some European territories, peaking inside the top-forty in Finland, Hungary and Spain. Madonna performed the track as the opening number of the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). During the performance, she is inside a medieval-looking cage in a kimono-like robe, with her dancers being dressed as gladiators.

During the recording process of "Rebel Heart", Madonna enlisted several collaborators, including MoZella, Symbolyc One and Toby Gad. Madonna posted a photograph of the trio working with her in a recording studio on her Instagram account. She said on the photograph, "Having an Iconic Moment in the studio with Toby-Mozilla and S1. My throat hurts from singing, laughing and crying." Gad worked with Madonna on fourteen songs, twelve appeared on the album's multiple track lists, with one being "Iconic". According to Gad, "The first week she was quite intimidating. It was like a test phase. You have to criticize, but you can't really offend. But she also likes honest, harsh critics to say things as they are. It worked out really well and she got sweeter and sweeter." For the track, she initially asked American rapper Jay Z to be featured on with verses about icons, however he called American rapper Chance the Rapper and said that it would be better if somebody that was a new person and that he thought that could be a new icon got on the record. Chance and Madonna had met before through American recording artist Frank Ocean in a concert and became friends, prompting the singer to accept Jay Z's suggestion.

Madonna also enlisted American professional boxer Mike Tyson to give a speech that would be used on the track. According to the singer, "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for "Rolling Stone" he explained: "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense."

In December 2014, thirteen unfinished demos of tracks for the album, including "Iconic", were leaked to the Internet. The leaked material included artwork suggesting the album was to be titled "Iconic" as well. The leaked version didn't feature either Chance the Rapper or Mike Tyson. In the same day, Madonna expressed her dissatisfaction with the leaked material, claiming it was an artistic rape and a form of terrorism. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an "early Christmas gift". On January 22, 2015, an updated version of the previously-leaked demo version surfaced online, with Chance and Tyson. On February 9, 2015, the singer released three other finished tracks, including the final version of "Iconic", as well as the album's track list.

"Iconic" was written by Madonna, Toby Gad, Maureen McDonald, Larry Griffin Jr., Chancelor Bennett, Dacoury Natche and Michael Tucker. It was produced by Madonna, Gad, AFSHeeN and Josh Cumbee, while DJ Dahi and Tucker served as additional producers. It features Chance the Rapper and Mike Tyson. Gad, AFSHeen and Cumbee were also responsible for programming and the song's instruments, with Gad also providing background vocals. The track was engineered and mixed by Demacio "Demo" Castellon with Gad and Angie Teo. It is an EDM song with trap influences, that starts with a "crowd cheering" and "rapturous applause" as Tyson opens the song with "a boastful spoken word segment". Later, the verses build up, with the hook having "a stomping rhythm to be sung 'en masse', with a high euphoric melody like a precocious, pre-recession club classic", as "The Quietus" Amy Pettifer described. As she added, "the sonically sparse verse breaks down" with the song featuring "machinic stabs" and "grinding electronic gears." Its pre-chorus "drops into stabs of ice-cold synths," with other instrumentation consisting in "marching drums and booming bass." Its "weird" beat was described by Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine as "Kanye and Jay-Z's 'H•A•M' arm-wrestling Skrillex."

Lyrically, "Iconic" talks about taking control of your life and letting your inner fire burn and encourages listeners to pursue their dreams. During the song, she urges the listeners to "making [their] voices heard before someone does it for [them]" with her voice "echoing like the announcer in the ring." In another part, during the motivational encouragement, she informs that "there's only two letters difference between 'I Can't' and 'Icon'," while also inspiring the listeners to find their own greatness, singing: "Just shine your light like a beautiful star / Show the world who you are." Tyson opening speech talks about how he's ‘the best the world's ever seen' and that he "worked hard and sweated [his] tears." He later proclaims: "I'm never falling again and if I did, I'll come back." Chance, on the other hand, raps about idolatry.

"Iconic" received favorable reviews from most music critics. Randall Roberts of the "Los Angeles Times" noted that the song is driving by "focus", which puts it "into that sweet spot between club frenzy and revelatory lyricism, the kind that can lift spirits to emotional heights." Neil McCormick of "The Daily Telegraph" described it as a song that "reflect[s] a contemporary trend for fast, furious and funny mash ups of conflicting ideas, constantly teetering on the edge of collapse but pulling out another beat or hook to keep things moving." In a similar mode, Kyler Anderson of "Entertainment Weekly" confessed that he thought the song would be his "most-skipped track", but admitted that he "kind of admire its barely-conscious chaos." James Grebey of "Spin" dismissed Tyson's inclusion, however he praised the song for having a statement that is the album's lynchpin and that "[w]ith its robotic, authoritarian droning, 'Iconic' conveys the point that — love her or hate her — Madonna is an icon, and you’re not getting rid of her anytime soon." John Marrs of "Gay Times" gave the track four out of five stars, claiming that "the finished product is wholly different from the demo and much more gutsy, getting better with every play." Lewis Corner of Digital Spy defined it as "a club-ready dash of trap-pop" and selected the song as one of the "tracks to download". Nick Levine of "Time Out" agreed, writing that "the sassy stuff is excellent, especially the catchy, trap-tinged 'Iconic'."

Sam C. Mac of "Slant Magazine" noted that the song has the album's "toughest, weirdest beat, not to mention a show-stopping Chance the Rapper verse and a pretty disarming message from the singer herself." He was unsure if Madonna meant to "embrace her iconic status or fight her way out from under its oppressive expectations" during the track, but praised the discontent and uncommon message for making the album her "most committed work since 2003's underrated 'American Life'." Bradley Stern of MuuMuse was positive, saying that the result is "a confidence-boosting compliment to a grueling gym workout." He continued: "The ominous beat drops are certainly more ‘on-trend’ than, say, 'Hold Tight,' but the song still feels (mostly) fresh and strange, as opposed to the late-to-the-party dubstep/EDM excursion on 'MDNA'. [...] It's a thrilling, weird and semi-embarrassing-yet-ultimately-empowering centerpiece of Rebel Heart that feels as bold as a song called 'Iconic' by Madonna should." Joe Lynch of "Billboard" called the collaboration "just about as odd as you'd expect", but labeled it "a fairly overwrought affair. Chance's verse is fire, but the intense, busy production ultimately adds up to very little." Michelle Geslani of Consequence of Sound pointed out that "as odd as the circumstances might be, the track surprisingly gels together far more smoothly than one would expect." Ben Kelly of "Attitude" named it "her own ‘bow down bitches’ moment." while Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of "Financial Times" said that the song is "wonderfully unhinged."

In a mixed analysis, Amy Pettifer of "The Quietus" called it "a Ted-talk of well-worn, motivational encouragement cloaked in a club anthem." Saaed Saaed of "The National" called the album's "mini slump," while Jonh Murphy of musicOMH noted that the song "falls rather flat." Annie Zaleski of "The A.V. Club" was confused with the song's message, saying that it "can’t decide if it wants to skewer fame or encourage people to embrace it." Lydia Jenkins wrote for "The New Zealand Herald" that the song "could definitely be accused of trying to emulate the success of Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse." Lauren Murphy of "The Irish Times" dismissed Tyson's appearance, declaring that his spoken word turn on 'Iconic' is tokenistic." Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound criticized the song's "lazy rhymes", which according to herself, lumps into "an awkward hybrid of EDM and hip-hop featuring one of hip-hop's finest [that] sounds out of place here amid the bass drops and robot vocals."

"Iconic" was chosen to be the opening song from the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). It begins with a video featuring Madonna in a glamorous dress cavorting with bare-bodied males juxtaposed with Mike Tyson talking inside of a cage. Tyson commented about the shooting, saying: "Riveting is not [the word]. It's just intense... I'm in a cage. I'm a hostage. I'm chained. I'm naked. I look like a savage. When I [shot] it, it didn't seem that intense. But then you watch it and go, 'Whoa'. It was like [something out of] National Geographic. I need to be tamed, man." Madonna performed wearing an "ornate kimono-like robe with wide sequin-lined sleeves" inside a medieval-looking cage surrounded by religious iconography that she later breaks out of as she sings the first lines, while guards dressed similar to the ones who guarded the Wicked Witch of the West's castle marched onstage. During the performance, she also hung upside down on a cross.

The performance was received with a positive response from critics. Jordan Zivitz of "Montreal Gazette" called the performance "insanely theatrical, Broadway-worthy." Melissa Maerz wrote for "Entertainment Weekly" that "As visually spectacular as it was narratively heavy-handed, it felt like a callback to her last tour, 'MDNA', which featured a dark charade that found Madonna wielding a gun on stage. But when the song ended with video footage of the gladiators knocking over a saintly-looking Madonna statue, the tone changed. Madonna has built a career by playing with what we hold sacred, whether it's crucifixes or underground dance crazes. Now the only sacred thing she's tearing down is Madonna herself." The performance of the song at the March 19–20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, "Rebel Heart Tour".

Domnall mac Taidc

Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115) was the ruler of the Kingdom of the Isles, the Kingdom of Thomond, and perhaps the Kingdom of Dublin as well. His father was Tadc, son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster, which meant that Domnall was a member of the Meic Taidc, a branch of the Uí Briain. Domnall's mother was Mór, daughter of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles, which may have given Domnall a stake to the kingship of the Isles.

In 1094, Domnall's uncle, Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland, drove Gofraid Crobán, King of Dublin and the Isles from Dublin, and may have replaced him with Domnall himself. Certainly at some point following Gofraid's death in 1095, Muirchertach installed Domnall as King of the Isles. The latter's reign was short-lived however, and Domnall appears to have been forced from the Isles prior to its subsequent conquest by the King of Norway.

In 1111, Domnall evidently seized the kingship of the Isles by force. It is uncertain whether he enjoyed Uí Briain support in this venture. Several years later, at a time when his aforesaid uncle was gravely ill, Domnall was again active in Ireland. Although he may have openly left the Isles to take advantage of his uncle's demise, it is also possible he was forced out by the Islesmen. Domnall was slain in 1115, apparently at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. It is possible that he was survived by two sons.

Domnall was a son of Tadc, son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster. Domnall was, therefore, a member of the Meic Taidc. According to the twelfth-century "Banshenchas", Domnall's father married Mór, daughter of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles. This source specifies that the couple had three sons and a daughter: Amlaíb, Bé Binn, Donnchad, and Domnall himself.

Toirdelbach Ua Briain died in 1086, and the Kingdom of Munster was partitioned between his three surviving sons: Muirchertach, Diarmait, and Tadc. The latter expired only a month after his father, after which Muirchertach drove Diarmait from Munster altogether, seizing the kingship for himself. Muirchertach then embarked upon extending his authority throughout Ireland. During this period, Muirchertach not only had to contend with the opposing forces of his surviving brother, but also those of the Meic Taidc, the sons of his deceased brother. In 1091, however, the Meic Taidc appear to have come to terms with Muirchertach—at least temporarily—as the seventeenth-century "Annals of the Four Masters" reports that a peace was agreed between him and the Meic Taidc, who are nonetheless said to have acted treacherously towards Muirchertach's men. Although Muirchertach appears to have regained control of the Kingdom of Dublin by 1090, he soon after lost it to Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles, until he forced the latter from the kingship of Dublin once and for all in 1094. It may have been at this point that Muirchertach installed his son, Domnall Gerrlámhach, to the kingship. Another possibility, however, is that Muirchertach instead appointed Domnall himself after Gofraid's expulsion.

Gofraid died in the Hebrides the year after his expulsion from Dublin. Whether this is evidence that he had been driven from Mann is uncertain. According to the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century "Chronicle of Mann", Gofraid was succeeded in the Isles by his eldest son, Lagmann, who appears to have been forced to fend off factions supporting the claims of his younger brothers. At some point, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach, and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lagmann's younger brother, Amlaíb mac Gofraid, was old enough to assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lagmann faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lagmann by itself, it approached Muirchertach for assistance in placing Amlaíb mac Gofraid upon the throne. Muirchertach was certainly a formidable potential ally, having recently imposed his dominance over the kingdoms of Connacht, Leinster, Mide, and Dublin. In consequence of this predominance, the clause as stated by the chronicle—that Muirchertach was to provide the Isles with a regent from his own kin—may well have been a condition on his intervention, rather than a request of the Islesmen themselves. Whatever the case, the chronicle reveals that Muirchertach then installed Domnall upon the throne.

Although Domnall had earlier opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he possessed strong familial connections with the Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach. In fact, the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century "Annals of Ulster" reveals that at least two apparent members of Echmarcach's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann. As a result of their demise, Domnall may well have become the leading male representative of his mother's family. From the standpoint of the Uí Briain, the union of Domnall's parents would, therefore, seem to have been orchestrated in the context of extending Uí Briain authority into the Isles. In 1096, the "Annals of the Four Masters" reveals that Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, lost his life on Mann, apparently whilst supporting Domnall's undertaking in the Isles. This source not only corroborates Uí Briain intervention in the Isles, but suggests that Domnall and the rest of the Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there, possibly in the form of Lagmann's adherents. The chronicle credits Domnall with an oppressive three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.

The extent of Domnall's rule in the kingdom is unknown, and it is questionable whether he had any real authority in the northern Hebrides, furthest from Mann. In about 1097, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway sent a delegate named Ingimundr into the Isles to take possession of the kingdom. After installing himself on Lewis, Ingimundr was overthrown and killed whilst attempting to usurp the kingship. Ingimundr's rationale for seating himself upon an island on the edge of the kingdom may have been due to the fact that he was unable to gain any authority on Mann itself. In fact, the chronicle reveals that civil war erupted there the following year, and the chronicler Orderic Vitalis indicates that Mann was devastated to point of being a virtual desert by the time Magnús appeared on the scene. The warring itself may have been related to the aforesaid factional struggles between Gofraid's sons. Although it is possible that it was Magnús who actually forced Domnall from the Isles, the fact the chronicle makes no mention of Domnall during the recorded conflict on Mann may be evidence that he had lost control of the island by then.

Within the year, Magnús himself arrived in the Isles, captured Lagmann, and conquered the kingdom. After overwintering in region, the Norwegian king left for Scandinavia in the summer, only to make his return nearly four years later, in 1102 or 1103. Once re-established on Mann, Magnús may well have seized control of Dublin before entering into an alliance with Muirchertach, formalised through the marriage between Magnús's young son, Sigurðr, and Muirchertach's daughter, Bjaðmunjo. The arrangement seems to reveal that Magnús intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won territories. Although it may have also meant that Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles was recognised by the Irish, it is also possible that Muirchertach intended to exert his own influence into the region through his new son-in-law. Unfortunately for Muirchertach, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103, whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway. Although Muirchertach was able to regain control of Dublin, and still held considerable influence in the Isles, Magnús' death appears to have left a power vacuum in the region that he was unable to fill.

In 1111, according to the eleventh- to fourteenth-century "Annals of Inisfallen", Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force. This annal-entry is the only notice of Domnall's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources. This could indicate that the chronicle's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated, and actually refers to about 1111. However, the fact that the chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new-found Uí Briain dominance in the region, before Magnús' arrival in the Isles, and at about the same time as Amlaíb's death, suggests that the chronicle's chronology concerning these events is sound, and that Domnall's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was indeed a return to the Isles.

There is uncertainty as to whether Domnall was supported in his venture by the rest of the Uí Briain. Although it is possible that he enjoyed backing from Muirchertach himself, the fact that the "Annals of the Four Masters" states that Muirchertach had Domnall imprisoned three years before could be evidence that Domnall had made his move into the Isles without Muirchertach's consent. The annal-entry concerning Domnall's seizure of the Isles reveals that Domnall launched his campaign from northern Ireland, and a further entry in the same source shows that Dublin was occupied by Muirchertach for about three months, the very year of Domnall's campaign. These records appear to indicate that Domnall was aided in his undertaking in the Isles by Muirchertach's northern opponents, and that Muirchertach occupied the town as means to directly counter Domnall's campaign, and deny him any support from the Dubliners. In fact, Domnall may well have been supported in the Isles by Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain, a northern monarch who was not only Muirchertach's principal rival, but the representative of a family with a long history of involvement in the region.

Not long after his intrusion into the Isles—perhaps in 1113 or 1114—Domnall appears to have been either driven out by force, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Muirchertach's failing health. This would appear to have been about the point when Amlaíb mac Gofraid began his own forty-year reign in the Isles. The latter, who apparently spent a considerable part of his childhood at the court of Henry I, King of England, may well have enjoyed the English king's assistance in assuming control of the Isles, and perhaps precipitated Domnall's departure. Whatever the cause for Domnall's return to Ireland, he certainly predeceased his rival uncle, and was killed by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht, as the "Annals of Inisfallen", the sixteenth-century "Annals of Loch Cé", the "Annals of the Four Masters", the fourteenth-century "Annals of Tigernach", and the "Annals of Ulster", all report Domnall's death at the hands of the Connachta in 1115. In fact, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had invaded Thomond earlier that year, and the "Annals of Tigernach" elaborates that he had installed Domnall as King of Thomond at that point. This source further reveals that Domnall had afterwards turned against Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, who in turn invaded Thomond and had Domnall eliminated.

Although two later members of the Uí Briain—Conchobar mac Domnaill Uí Briain, King of Ormond (blinded 1128), and Lughaid mac Domnaill Uí Briain—appear to have been sons of Domnall's aforesaid first cousin, Domnall Gerrlámhach, it is possible they were instead descendants of Domnall himself.

The Two Roses

The Two Roses is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on the young Tony Prolo who goes to deliver lunch to his father of the same name. After arriving and giving him his lunch, the young Tony is hit by a passing vehicle and the father rushes his son home. Mr. Sears, whose car hit the child, receives a demand for $10,000 by the "Black Hand". The Sears go to the police and set a trap for the Black Hand, but end up wrongly arresting the child's father. Tony convinces the police to investigate further and the confusion is cleared up when the real culprit is caught. Mr. Sears compensates the family by purchasing them a house in the countryside. The film features Marie Eline, cast in the role of an Italian boy, along with the leading players Frank H. Crane and Anna Rosemond as the parents. The film was released on June 7, 1910. The film survives with new inter-titles that were created to replace the lost materials.

The film begins with a young Italian boy, Tony Prolo, who is preparing to deliver his father's lunch to him. The boy sets off to the railroad construction area, passing the dangerous terrain without incident. The father, Tony Prolo (Senior), greets his young son and happily takes his lunch. His young son begins tossing rocks across the street and runs out into the road and is knocked down by a passing vehicle. Tony rushes to his son's aid and the rich man, Mr. Sears gets out the car and attempts to comfort the father. The father rejects him and rushes home, carrying his son in his arms. At home, Tony Prolo and his wife attend to their son and pray for his health.

At his residence, Mr. Sears receives a letter by the "Black Hand" demanding $10,000 for ruining a person's life. The letter tells him to give the money to a man at a specific street corner who will be carrying a white rose. Sears heads to the police and the detective lays a trap for the Black Hand man. At the same time, Tony Prolo has gone to see the doctor and stops by the florist to get a white rose for his flower-loving son. After he purchases the rose, his path crosses with Mr. Sears and the detective at the street corner, and he is arrested because he is carrying a white rose. The real Black Hand man is hiding behind a door and witnesses the arrest of Tony Prolo, but is discovered by the constable and he is arrested after he was discovered carrying a white rose.

Tony Prolo convinces the Sears to have the police investigate his story, and they all are brought to Tony Prolo's home. The Sears family sees his suffering son and the confusion over the Black Hand is resolved when the constable brings the real suspect into the room. Tony Prolo is released and Mr. Sears compensates the family by purchasing a cottage in the country that is surrounding by white roses.


The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it may have been Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by "The New York Evening World" while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film director is unknown, but two Thanhouser directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, "Romeo and Juliet". Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions.

The role of the Italian father Tony was played by Frank H. Crane. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. In the role of Tony's wife was Anna Rosemond, who was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Marie Eline, played the role of Tony's son, was concealed in masculine make up and black hair for the role of the Italian boy. "The Moving Picture World" said, "[m]aybe you'd never recognize her if we did not tip you off. Don't pass the tip to others in your place, but see if their little favorite doesn't fool them completely in her masculine makeup." Other members of the cast have not been identified.

The single-reel drama, approximately 1000 feet long, was released on June 7, 1910. This production was the first Tuesday release in the Thanhouser "two a week" releases. The production was advertised as a "A powerful, pathetic, pretty story of life in Little Italy." The "Moving Picture World" contained a brief article that used the term "The Thanhouser Kid" to describe Marie Eline; it was the origin of the nickname for Eline. The film had a wide national release: it was advertised by theaters in Kansas, Indiana, Texas, and Pennsylvania.

In 1987, the film was erroneously claimed to be an adaptation of Charles Dickens serial novel "Little Dorrit" by H. Philip Bolton in "Novels on Stage - Dickens dramatized". Bolton writes, "[t]he first film in some sense from the novel - albeit indirectly - would appear to have been a "Two Roses" movie produced in 1910 by Thanhouser."

A mostly complete print of the film survives and has been preserved in its 35 mm state by the Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum für Film und Fernsehen in Berlin. The surviving print had only a French language title card "Les Deux Roses" and was devoid of intertitles. New German intertitles were added by Urte Alfs and Anke Mebold of the Deutsches Filminstitut based on the published synopsis from "The Moving Picture World". The restored work uses an original music composition composed and performed by Günter A. Buchwald. Ned Thanhouser made available an English language translation of the new German intertitles . The film is also released as part of a two-disc DVD set, "Screening the Poor", published in the Edition Filmmuseum Series.

The Mad Hermit

The Mad Hermit is a 1910 American silent short drama film produced by the Thanhouser Company. The story focuses on Harry Willard, who becomes a hermit after his wife and daughter leave him. He spends a quarter of a century in isolation, but he stumbles across a runaway carriage and the woman tosses her baby to him. He runs into the wilderness and prepares to kill it, but he stays his hand when he sees the baby's locket. The parents survive the carriage crash and seek out the hermit, and it is revealed that the baby's mother is the daughter of Harry Willard. Created by a staff of twenty, it was the first film to be produced by the Thanhouser Company. The film was released in August 9, 1910, after the success of the company was ensured, and met with positive reception by critics. The film is presumed lost.

Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in "The Moving Picture World" from August 13, 1910. It states: "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - and it is the old, old story. She takes her tiny daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as he reads the announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he comes out of it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day he forgets his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears the clatter of hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and his hand is stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!"

"The parents of the baby have miraculously escaped death in the crash of their carriage and trace the strange creature who rescued the child to his lair. They arrive as he ponders upon the picture in the locket and tries to recall the original of it. The babe is the daughter of the original and its mother the hermit's daughter, Agnes - the one-time tot whom the deserting wife took with her. A wife and mother, she is quite a mature woman now - but her features are unchanged. The face appears familiar to the hermit and he tries to place it. Eventually he succeeds. The shock of recognition dazes him - and changes him. The light of sanity returns to his eyes. His reason is restored. He takes to his breast the daughter whom he had lost and found again. She takes him from his forest home and back to the civilization that had tricked him. But the kindly care and love his daughter bestows on him to act in a measure as a recompense for the wrong done him in the long ago, and with the passing years the bitterness passes from his being. The picture touches the heartstrings; it will please to a certainty."

"The Mad Hermit" was the first film to be produced by the Thanhouser Company, but the first release was "The Actor's Children". The writer of the scenario is unknown. The film was shot in the autumn of 1909. Edwin Thanhouser would later describe the production as, "...a rather lamentable affair. It included everything from murder through robbery and a love story. It boasted enough material for 15 plots." According to Q. David Bowers, Edwin Thanhouser felt that the production had many amateurish aspects and held off on releasing the film until the reputation of the company was secured. The film was directed by Barry O'Neil, the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy. O'Neil would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, "Romeo and Juliet". There are no known credits for the cast, but Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two possible actors that were prominent players in 1910. Involved with the company since its beginnings, Anna Rosemond was one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era. Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. A later statement by Edwin Thanhouser would state that 20 persons, including the director and cameraman, were involved in the production. A surviving film still leaves open the possibility of identifying two characters.

The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on August 9, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertisements including those in Kansas, California, Arizona, Nebraska, Washington, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Texas. An advertisement for the Province Theatre suggests that the film arrived in British Columbia, Canada within days of its release.

The film received praise from critics with "The Moving Picture World" stating, "[It is a] picture which touches the heart and arouses the strongest emotions. It can be readily understood how a man might become a maniac under such circumstances. The loss of a wife and daughter is sufficient to overthrow reason. That a man should be a hermit afterward seems not unusual. Then comes the excitement of the runaway, the rescue of the baby and the discovery of his daughter, with returning reason and love to follow during his declining years. The emotions will be strongly aroused by this picture, and that will make it popular. Whatever touches the heart is always popular, and this seems to appeal with unusual power." "The New York Dramatic Mirror" offered minor praise for the film for the production and its acting.

1991 Sierra Madre earthquake

The 1991 Sierra Madre earthquake occurred on June 28 at with a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII ("Very strong"). The thrust earthquake resulted in two deaths, around 100 injuries, and damage estimated at $33.5–40 million. The event occurred beneath the San Gabriel Mountains on the Clamshell–Sawpit Fault, which is a part of the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System. Instruments captured the event at a number of strong motion stations in Southern California.

Due to its history of generating great earthquakes (1857, 1906) the focal point of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.

Geodetic research has shown that crustal shortening is occurring in the region of the Transverse Ranges at a rate of per year. Although a number of earthquakes have occurred in the Los Angeles area since 1971, the rate of moderate events since then may not be typical, and few large events have occurred since records have been kept. The rate of contraction and too few moderate events that have occurred indicated to researchers that a deficit of seismic energy release exists, and that larger, but less frequent events may also contribute to the release of strain accumulation.

To the west of the San Andreas Fault, the southern edge of the Transverse Ranges has been in a state of contraction during the Quaternary Period, with active reverse faulting that has uplifted San Gabriel Mountains. The west-striking (and range-bounding) Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Faults, as well as the San Cayetano Fault and Santa Susana Faults all exhibit a component of left-lateral strike-slip motion and share a similar trend.

The Malibu Coast–Santa Monica Fault lies at the southern flank of the Santa Monica Mountains and the Raymond Fault runs to the south of the Verdugo Mountains and meets the San Gabriel Mountains at Monrovia. The Clamshell–Sawpit Fault lies beneath the San Gabriel Mountains inline with the Raymond Fault. The characteristics of the various faults are difficult to interpret, but they all dip steeply to the north with several thousand feet of displacement.

The shock occurred on June 28, 1991, at 07:43:55 local time, and was the result of thrust faulting on the Clamshell–Sawpit Fault at the southern boundary of the San Gabriel Mountains. At less than , the total amount of uplift was very minimal, considering the of vertical displacement that was observed during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. The uplift initiated about two million years ago, and is a result of the convergence of the Pacific and North American Plates near the restraining bend of the San Andreas Fault.

The earthquake was felt from Santa Barbara in the north, to Palm Springs in the east, and south to the Mexico–United States border. It was centered about northeast of Sierra Madre. Hundreds of homes were damaged and at least three roads leading up to Mount Wilson were blocked by landslides. A woman was killed when a steel beam fell at the Santa Anita Park raceway in Arcadia and another woman died as a result of a heart attack in Glendale.

Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 was badly damaged. Other structural damage resulted from the shock. For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each had more than a dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, but for the most part damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.

With an area of perceptibility of around 58,500 km, the shock was felt from Santa Barbara and Bakersfield to San Diego, Palm Springs, and Las Vegas. This is about half the felt area that was seen during the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which was felt over an area of 110,000 km. The maximum intensity observed in the urban areas that were affected was VII ("Very strong"), but the intensity in the epicentral area is unknown because of its remote location in the mountainous Angeles National Forest, though rock slides and landslides occurred there as a result of strong shaking. Intensity VI ("Strong") effects were observed over 1,100 km, from Altadena and La Verne along the base of the mountains, to East Los Angeles.

The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (CSMIP) obtained 120 records from 48 ground response stations, 38 buildings, six dams, an airport control tower, and a power station. The individual stations that reported were as close as (Cogswell Dam) to as far as (Neenach), but most were within . In downtown Pasadena, accelerations of .20"g" were measured at the bottom floor of three buildings, but the duration of strong motion was only about two seconds. At the Altadena station ( from the epicenter) .46"g" was recorded. The Cogswell Dam station recorded a peak horizontal acceleration of .58"g", but no major damage occurred.

Although the long term slip rate of the constituent faults that make up the Sierra Madre Fault Zone are not precisely known, several studies have put forth scenarios for possible future activity. Two independent reports suggested that if the complete () fault system were to rupture, it could result in a 7.7 shock similar to the 1952 Kern County earthquake. One researcher stated that the recurrence interval for such an event would be greater than 5,000 years. Another proposal was for one of the seven individual segments to rupture in a M6.4–6.6 event, comparable with the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. The recurrence interval for this type of event was placed at 200 years.

Get to Heaven

Get to Heaven is the third studio album by British band Everything Everything. Recorded primarily in Angelic Studios in Northampton during the latter half of 2014 with producer Stuart Price, it was released on 22 June 2015 on RCA Records. A deluxe edition, featuring an additional six tracks, was released simultaneously. It peaked at number seven on the United Kingdom Albums Chart, also charting in Australia and Ireland. The tracks "Distant Past", "Regret", "Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread", and "No Reptiles" were released as singles throughout 2015.

The album's lyrical themes are dark, focusing on global tensions and political happenings during 2014. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, media coverage of the 2015 general election in the United Kingdom, and various mass shootings influenced its writing. The band's musical sound was composed to provide contradiction to the violent subject matter, and is inspired by artists such as Radiohead, Suicide, and Kendrick Lamar. As with previous Everything Everything work, most of the songs are presented as in-character narrations.

"Get to Heaven" was well received by critics, with most reviewers noting the effectiveness of the album's message; others commented on its bold, aggressive nature, with some labelling the tone "overwhelming". It was at one point touted as a favourite to win the 2015 Mercury Prize, but was not ultimately shortlisted for the award.

Initial work on "Get to Heaven" was done during a busy touring schedule for the group's second album "Arc" (2013). Following this tour, they rented studio space in Wales in an effort to be "away and isolated", but nothing came of these sessions. The album itself was recorded at Angelic Studios in Northampton during 2014. The liner notes suggest several other spaces were also used for parts of the album, including Crotch Int. in Gilsland, Eve Studios in Bredbury, Making Do in Manchester, and Distillery in Wiltshire. They hinted at the album's production through their Twitter account in August 2014, and announced they were in the process of recording two weeks later.

Everything Everything went into the studio aiming to "make people want to move", and set about avoiding slower-paced songs that had featured strongly on their previous album. This became apparent to them following the writing of eventual album closer "Warm Healer". Lead vocalist, Jonathan Higgs, told "Anthem Magazine" that "we kind of ripped up that rule book after reali[s]ing, 'Right. Let’s not write something this quiet. Let’s do horrible stuff from now on'". The group worked on ideas for songs as they came to them, rather than their previous method of practising and recording as a live group. Bass guitarist, Jeremy Pritchard, explained to "Skiddle" that the group were keen to create a record that would "stand up for the huge amount of time you spend touring a record", which in turn inspired a more pop-oriented sound than had appeared on "Arc". Higgs later discussed how they used their previous sound to inform the direction of "Get to Heaven", seeking to avoid "quiet songs" and "tenderness" in an effort to "inject a new fire into ourselves".

Though previous albums were produced by David Kosten, they enlisted the support of producer Stuart Price after he impressed them with his work on a demo version of the eventual single, "Regret". As Price was based in Los Angeles, the band emailed him samples of their work for him to critique and receive his suggested mixes in return. They had mixed reactions to his suggestions; at one point during production of "Hapsburg Lippp" – a track which did not make the final track listing – Price returned them a reggae-inspired mix as a joke. Higgs explained to Andy Morris of "Gigwise" that Price had an "ability to become one of us very quickly". Price joined them in person for the last nine days of recording. Guitarist Alex Robertshaw said to "Digital Spy" that his positivity made an impression on them: "Just [having] another seriously creative person in the room with you is fantastic."

During recording sessions, Higgs suffered from depression. He referred to the end of their 150-date tour as "an out-of-the-sauna-and-into-a-cold-bath experience", adding that "riding that low as well as trying to make a record was quite hard". He was affected by frequent mood swings as a result of his medication; Pritchard said that these "affected [them] pretty adversely". Drummer, Michael Spearman, explained to "Q" that Higgs's attempt to channel his depression into his writing worried the rest of the group. At one point during writing sessions, Higgs presented his bandmates with "Pigdog", a song about "how [he is] a horrible person and [he doesn't] want to be one any more". Spearman objected to this style: "For me that was a turning point. I was like, 'Let's make a record that’s energetic and fucked up and exciting.'"

Robertshaw told "Drowned in Sound"'s Robert Leedham that the album is "bolder" than the group's previous work, and is "the most Everything Everything record we've ever done". The band aimed for a "euphoric" sound to provide a "contradiction between the way the lyrics are and [their] sound". In March 2015, they described their sound as "Baroque Obama" on Facebook, explaining to "Gigwise" that "it's where Bach meets Jay Z". For certain tracks, Robertshaw said their aim was "to sound like changing radio stations", toying with various musical ideas in one song in the same style as Kendrick Lamar. Spearman compared this style to the humour in "The Simpsons": "It's twenty minutes of 'bang, bang, bang' – where it started up was way different to where it ends up. The stories are just fucking crazy. That's fun to us."

Higgs named Suicide's 1977 single "Frankie Teardrop" as a major influence on the album's sound, describing it as "genuinely scary music": "It's a song: I shouldn't be feeling like this." They tried to replicate this unsettling, unpredictable sound on the album, but "wanted a happy ending". In an interview with "The Independent", Higgs spoke of Radiohead's critically acclaimed "Kid A" (2000) as a further influence, as they "threw out guitars, and with it the very idea of genre". Radiohead's influence on the record was commented on further by Laura Snapes at "Pitchfork", who noted the use of a "paranoid guitar solo borrowed from "Hail to the Thief"". Critics would later refer to their sound generally as "maximalist art pop" or art rock. In other sections of the album, they experimented with other genres; Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the "Financial Times" noted the "Talking Heads-style Afro-pop" of title track "Get to Heaven".

Most of the melodies on "Get to Heaven" originated from Robertshaw's guitar, though he recalled to Rich Chamberlain of MusicRadar that Higgs would occasionally approach the rest of the group with "an insane laptop creation" which would have to be translated to work as a group. Several tracks feature complex guitar solos, as noted by Chamberlain; one such solo, featured on the title track "Get to Heaven", was originally recorded in a hotel room. Another, on the single "Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread", makes heavy use of an MWFX Judder pedal. Robertshaw told Chamberlain that "[it] is a bit of a signature for the new record... You can do totally unrealistic things with it and it makes you sound like Steve Vai on crack."

The album's themes revolve around events which took place in 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the British media's handling of the United Kingdom general election, as well as on the state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the "London Evening Standard" that "we're in an age where we're more conscious of [upheaval and violence ...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." He later described the album as a "horror bible".

The album's opening track, "To the Blade", focuses on the death of Manchester-born aid worker Alan Henning at the hands of ISIL's "Jihadi John". Higgs explained to "Drowned in Sound" that: "He was a taxi driver from Stockport, I could have met him. And the fact that someone who did it was also from Britain, but this was being played out on a global scale... It seemed like the craziest thing I’d ever heard." Other songs criticise political leaders in the United Kingdom. Higgs had been vocal of his distaste of politics in interviews following the release of "Arc." Several critics suggest that "The Wheel (Is Turning Now)" is a commentary on the "snake-oil appeal" of then-UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage; Higgs told "The Line of Best Fit" that the song also comments on "religious leaders and charismatic, corrupt leaders, or even men as gods". "No Reptiles" supposes that political leaders are "just fat, bald, old men, like soft-boiled eggs, that are just weak-willed, with no strong feelings (good or ill)"; its lyrics also make cryptic reference to Elliot Rodger, who carried out the 2014 Isla Vista killings.

Much of the album is presented in-character through the eyes of various fictional characters and onlookers. "Fortune 500" documents a fictional attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II, which Higgs relates to the thoughts of suicide bombers moments before they detonate: "The horror of the doubt is far worse than the act, for the terrorist I mean. It’s this 'oh shit... maybe this isn’t what God wants'. I think it’s the darkest moment on the record." Spearman called the inclusion of loaded, political lyrics on otherwise upbeat songs "the Trojan Horse approach ... get your interesting lyrical idea into something that on the face of it is just there to be enjoyed". Higgs told "NME" that Kanye West's 2013 album "Yeezus" had a major impact on his writing, encouraging him to present himself more confidently, while Nick Cave provided inspiration to be more impulsive with his writing.

In November 2014, near the end of the album's production, Everything Everything performed an artist residency at the Manchester Central Library. The band began marketing the album through a teaser campaign on their social media feeds, featuring lyrics from the album. They announced "Get to Heaven"'s title and initial release date on 14 February 2015. The album's first single, "Distant Past", was debuted on 17 February 2015 on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show, with the official music video released later that day through YouTube. They debuted several new songs from the album at a show at the Oval Space in London on 9 April 2015. The second single from the album, "Regret", was premiered by DJ Annie Mac on 29 April 2015.

The album art, designed by New Zealand surrealist illustrator Andrew Archer, was not revealed until May. In an interview with "Brighton's Finest", Higgs explained the image represents a faith healer "being faith-healed, his face a kind of agony/ecstasy expression", with the bold colour palette representing the album's themes of extremism and information overload. Liner notes, which included large-type excerpts of the album's lyrics on bright gradients, were designed by Johnny Costello of Adult Art Club "to echo high impact religious posters". The album's artwork was included in "Creative Review"'s list of the top ten album covers of 2015.

The album was released on 22 June 2015 in the United Kingdom and worldwide on RCA Records. Its title was almost "Gimme the Gun", though the band decided not to "put a cherry" on the aggressive lyrical content. Instead, "Get to Heaven" was chosen to represent hope and positivity. The album was released in the United States on 26 February 2016 through independent record label Big Picnic/RED.

Everything Everything announced a string of United Kingdom touring dates to promote "Get to Heaven", scheduled for 7–21 November 2015, culminating with a show at the O2 Apollo Manchester. They appeared at various European festivals during 2015 including Glastonbury and T in the Park. The American release was promoted with the group's first tour of the United States, playing fifteen dates in support of Welsh indie rock band The Joy Formidable.

Aggregating website Metacritic reported a normalised rating of 80 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating "generally favourable" reception. "Q" wrote that the album was "spectacular" in a five-star review, and later named the album as the 20th-best of the year. "The Telegraph"'s Helen Brown commented that "the lads have given this album everything, everything and then some", while Andrew Backhouse of "DIY" called it "a masterpiece": "this is in a new gear to what their younger selves – or any other band today – could ever dream of." Much was said about the album's reliance on dark themes. Laura Snapes of "Pitchfork" wrote that these can be "overwhelming", though she credited them for "attempting to offer a nuanced understanding of a broken world at a time when a lot of their significantly less imaginative British indie rock peers say worse than nothing".

Critics also commented on the contrast between lyrical themes and underlying music. "Digital Spy"'s Harry Fletcher wrote that there is "something eminently Mancunian" about the clash in styles. "Uncut" praised the band's "innovative songcraft", but added "their tendency to overthink and squeeze every drop of pleasure from their work does them few favours", while "Mojo" suggested that they were "self-consciously dialing everything up to 11 before things go up in flames". "The Guardian"'s Alexis Petridis compared the album's sound to its themes in a three-star review, suggesting that the album "[evokes] the information overload of 24-hour rolling news so well that it essentially provokes the same reaction: it's often compelling, but you occasionally find yourself gripped by an overwhelming urge to turn it off". The album was among the favourites for the Mercury Prize, with British bookmakers Ladbrokes at one time offering odds of 4/1, but was not among the twelve albums selected for the shortlist. BBC News Online included the album on their list of "ten albums they missed".

"Get to Heaven" entered the United Kingdom Albums Chart at number seven, and the ARIA Charts (Australia) at number twenty-nine. Singles "Distant Past" and "Regret" peaked in the United Kingdom at numbers 88 and 119, respectively, while "Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread" failed to chart.

Ottoman ironclad Asar-i Tevfik

Asar-i Tevfik (Ottoman Turkish: God's Favor) was an ironclad warship of the Ottoman Navy built in the 1860s, the only member of her class. She was built as part of a major expansion program for the Ottoman fleet in the 1860s following the Crimean War. "Asar-i Tevfik" was a barbette ship armed with a main battery of eight guns in a central battery. In 1903–1906, the ship was extensively rebuilt in Germany and a new battery of and quick-firing guns replaced the older weapons.

"Asar-i Tevfik" served in the Ottoman fleet for more than four decades. During this period, she saw action in two major wars, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 and the First Balkan War in 1913. During the first conflict, she was torpedoed by a Russian torpedo boat but was only slightly damaged. She took part in the abortive Battle of Elli against the Greek Navy in December 1912 during the First Balkan War. While operating against Bulgarian positions in February 1913, she ran aground; Bulgarian field artillery then shelled the ship. The damage they inflicted, coupled with heavy seas, destroyed the ship.

In the aftermath of the Crimean War, where an entire Ottoman squadron was destroyed by a Russian fleet at Sinop, the Ottoman Empire began a small naval construction program, limited primarily by the chronically weak Ottoman economy. The design for "Asar-i Tevfik" was based on contemporary French warships like the s, although significantly reduced in size.

"Asar-i Tevfik" was long between perpendiculars and she had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally. The ship had an iron hull with a partial double bottom and a ram bow, as was customary for ironclads of the period. She had a crew of 320 officers and enlisted men. In 1903–06, the ship was substantially rebuilt. Both ends were cut down, a single military mast was installed amidships, and a new conning tower was built.

The ship was powered by a single horizontal compound steam engine that drove one screw propeller. Steam was provided by six box boilers, which were trunked into a single funnel amidships. The engines and boilers were both manufactured by her builder at the La Seyne shipyard. The engines were rated at for a top speed of , though by 1895 poor maintenance over her career had reduced her top speed to . The steam engine was supplemented by a barque sailing rig. During the reconstruction, the sailing rig was removed and the old boilers were replaced with newer Niclausse boilers. She also received a new engine, the performance of which is unknown.

"Asar-i Tevfik" was armed with a main battery of eight muzzle-loading guns manufactured by Armstrong Whitworth. Six of the guns were mounted in an armored battery amidships, with three on each broadside, and the other two were placed directly above in open barbettes. In 1891, the two barbette guns were replaced with breech-loading guns built by Krupp, and several smaller Krupp guns were installed. These included a pair of guns and a pair of guns. Two Nordenfelt guns were also added.

The ship's armament was radically revised during the 1903–06 reconstruction. All of the old guns were removed and a battery of medium-caliber quick-firing (QF) guns manufactured by Krupp was installed. Three SK L/40 guns in single shielded mounts were placed forward, with one on the forecastle and the other two abreast of the conning tower. The central battery guns were replaced with six SK L/40 guns, with a seventh gun mounted on the stern. Six and two QF guns were also added.

As built, the ship was protected with an iron armored belt that was thick. The transverse bulkheads that connected both ends of the belt were thick. The central battery had thinner iron plating than the belt, at , and the barbette guns were protected with of iron. The reconstruction added a 75 mm armored deck, and the new conning tower was protected with 150 mm thick armor plating.

"Asar-i Tevfik" was ordered in 1865 by the government of Egypt as "Ibrahimiye" and laid down two years later at the French "Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée" shipyard in La Seyne. The ship was launched in 1868 and completed by 1869 for sea trials. In the meantime, Egypt had transitioned from a state directly ruled by the Ottoman government to the autonomous Khedivate of Egypt, and on 29 August 1868 the Khedivate transferred the ship to the Ottoman Navy. She was commissioned as "Asar-i Tevfik" in 1870. Upon completion, "Asar-i Tevfik" and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in stabilizing the island in the aftermath of the Cretan Revolt of 1866–1869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals.

The ship saw action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1888. She spent the war in the Black Sea squadron. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Hobart Pasha, was vastly superior to the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the only ironclads the Russians possessed there were and , circular vessels that had proved to be useless in service. The presence of the fleet did force the Russians to keep two corps in reserve for coastal defense, but the Ottoman high command failed to make use of its naval superiority in a more meaningful way, particularly to hinder the Russian advance into the Balkans. Hobart Pasha took the fleet to the western Black Sea, where he was able to make a more aggressive use of it to support the Ottoman forces battling the Russians in the Caucasus. The fleet bombarded Poti and assisted in the defense of Batumi.

In June, the Russian Baltic Fleet began a campaign to neutralize the Ottoman ironclads using torpedo boats equipped with towed and spar torpedoes. On the night of 23–24 August 1877, three Russian torpedo boats, , , and , attempted to sink the ship with spar torpedoes while she was moored in Sukhumi. Gunfire from the Ottoman ships, along with troops on the shore, made the Russian attack difficult. "Sinop" detonated her torpedo against a boat that was protecting "Asar-i Tevfik", causing only minor damage to the ironclad, though the Russians initially believed they had sunk her. The ship was able to steam to Batumi, where she was repaired. The attackers had been aided by a fire burning on the beach, which illuminated the Ottoman vessels in the harbor. The Ottoman fleet continued to support the Ottoman garrison at Batumi, when held out against constant Russian attacks to the end of the war. After the end of the war, the ship was laid up in 1878 at Constantinople, the Ottoman capital.

From 1890 to 1892, the ship was re-boilered at the Imperial Arsenal on the Golden Horn. Following the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the seriously degraded state of the Ottoman fleet, the government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. The first stage was to rebuild the older armored warships, including "Asar-i Tevfik". Requests for proposals were sent to foreign shipyards, and in October 1898 the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa requested permission to survey the ship and the ironclad . Both vessels were accordingly sent to Genoa in January 1899, arriving on the 28th. There she was briefly laid up. Instead, "Asar-i Tevfik" was transferred to the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel, Germany for a major reconstruction, arriving on 29 May 1900, with the transport "İzmir".

After docking in Kiel, the men from "Asar-i Tevfik" were transferred to "İzmir", but with no funds to buy coal, the men were stranded in Germany. Germaniawerft stripped down "Asar-i Tevfik", but then halted work to await the first Ottoman payment. By mid-1901, the men had accumulated significant debt and the Ottoman government had made no effort to return them or pay the installments for the modernization program. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II became involved in an attempt to press the Ottoman government to settle the debts incurred by the sailors. Instead, the Ottomans demanded that Krupp, the owner of the Germaniawerft shipyard, make an advance of 6,000 lira so that "İzmir" could be prepared for the voyage back to Constantinople. The Ottomans were at the time negotiating for a large armament contract with Krupp for the Army, and used this as leverage; by late 1901, Krupp conceded, rather than risk the lucrative contract. The debts in Kiel were paid and "İzmir" finally departed for home.

No work was done to the ship over the following two years. On 18 January 1904, Ottoman negotiators began a new round of talks with Krupp, demanding a reduction in the cost of the modernization from 282,000 lira to 65,000 lira; this amount does not cover the preparatory work that had been initially carried out, let alone the reconstruction. In return, the Ottoman government would order a pair of torpedo cruisers—the —from Germaniawerft. With the armament contract still under negotiation, Krupp was forced to concede, despite the significant financial loss the reconstruction deal represented. By April, the armament contract was signed, and so work began slowly on "Asar-i Tevfik". Work was completed by late 1906. The reconstructed ship departed Kiel on 19 November, and arrived in Constantinople on 4 January 1907.

In 1909, she participated in the first fleet maneuver conducted by the Ottoman Navy in twenty years. During the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912, "Asar-i Tevfik" was assigned to the Reserve Division, along with "Mesudiye" and the torpedo cruiser . She did not see action during the conflict, since the Ottoman fleet spent the war in port. This was in part due to the rising tensions in the Balkans that presaged the Balkan Wars; the Ottomans kept their fleet in port so it could be prepared for the inevitable conflict.

The ship saw significant service during the First Balkan War of 1912–1913. At the start of the war, "Asar-i Tevfik" was suffering from boiler trouble, which necessitated repairs that lasted until 9 November. She was then sent to support the Ottoman troops defending the Çatalca Line against Bulgarian troops. She took up a position off Tekirdağ to provide gunfire support. After the Bulgarians occupied the town, she bombarded their positions, but the attack had little effect. The ship was then moved to Büyükçekmece, where she joined the rest of the fleet. They had no contact with Bulgarian forces during this period.

She took part in the Battle of Elli, the first Ottoman surface action involving major warships since the Russo-Turkish War, on 16 December 1912. "Asar-i Tevfik" joined a fleet consisting of the pre-dreadnought battleships and , "Mesudiye", and several smaller warships. The Ottoman fleet sortied from the Dardanelles at 9:30; the smaller craft remained at the mouth of the straits while the battleships sailed north, hugging the coast. The Greek flotilla, which included the armored cruiser and three s, sailing from the island of Lemnos, altered course to the northeast to block the advance of the Ottoman battleships.

The Ottoman ships opened fire on the Greeks at 9:40, from a range of about . Five minutes later, "Georgios Averof" crossed over to the other side of the Ottoman fleet, placing the Ottomans in the unfavorable position of being under fire from both sides. At 9:50 and under heavy pressure from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, and headed for the safety of the straits. The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. When they approached the straits, "Asar-i Tevfik" and "Mesudiye" took up positions to cover the withdrawal of the damaged pre-dreadnoughts. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship "Resit Paşa". "Asar-i Tevfik" had not been hit in the engagement. The battle was considered a Greek victory, because the Ottoman fleet remained blockaded.

On 10 January 1913, "Asar-i Tevfik" supported another sortie by the fleet, this time patrolling off the Dardanelles while the rest of the fleet raided Imbros. While protecting the fleet's flank, she encountered Greek destroyers and forced them to withdraw after firing a few shots. Neither side scored any hits in the engagement. The ship was lost while operating in the Black Sea against Bulgarian forces. On 7 February, the ship was ordered to proceed to Yalıköy to support a raid by the Army. The following day, the raid was launched on the town, but was quickly forced to withdraw from heavy Bulgarian resistance; "Asar-i Tevfik" was ordered to move in and shell the town, but ran aground on an uncharted sandbank at 12:45. On 10 February, salvage work began, beginning with the removal of equipment. By the 12th, all armament and coal had been removed, but the ship could not be freed. Heavy seas and Bulgarian artillery damaged the wreck, which rendered her a total loss.

Leccinum rugosiceps

Leccinum rugosiceps, commonly known as the wrinkled Leccinum, is a species of bolete fungus. It is found in Asia, North America, Central America, and South America, where it grows in an ectomycorrhizal association with oak. Fruitbodies have convex, yellowish caps up to in diameter. In age, the cap surface becomes wrinkled, often revealing white cracks. The stipe is up to long and wide, with brown scabers on an underlying yellowish surface. It has firm flesh that stains initially pinkish to reddish and then to grayish or blackish when injured. The pore surface on the cap underside is yellowish. Fruitbodies are edible, although opinions vary as to their desirability.

The species was first described scientifically in 1904 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as "Boletus rugosiceps". The type collection was made in the woods of Port Jefferson, New York. Rolf Singer transferred it to "Leccinum" in 1945. Synonyms include "Krombholzia rugosiceps", published by Rolf Singer in 1942, and "Krombholziella rugosiceps", published by Josef Šutara in 1982. "Krombholzia" and "Krombholziella" are now obsolete genera that have since been subsumed into "Leccinum".

"Leccinum rugosiceps" is classified in the section "Luteoscabrum" of genus "Leccinum", a grouping of species that associated with oak and hornbeam. Others in this section include "L. albellum" and "L. pseudoscabrum".

The specific epithet "rugosiceps", which is derived from the Latin roots for "rough" and "head", refers to its wrinkled cap. It is commonly known as the "wrinkled Leccinum".

The convex cap measures wide. Its color is orange-yellow, aging to yellow-brown. The cap margin has a narrow flap of sterile tissue. The surface of the cap is dry, with wrinkles and pits at maturity. It often becomes cracked in age, and the whitish flesh underneath shows through. The cap tends to undergo significant color changes throughout its development—first bright yellow, then dark brown, then finally pale tan—which may make it difficult to identify in the field. The flesh is white to pale yellow, and it stains reddish to burgundy when cut or bruised. This staining is most prominent at the junction of the cap and the stipe. Further exposure over the course of 20–60 minutes results in the flesh becoming grayish to blackish. The flesh has no distinctive door or taste. The pore surface is initially dull yellow, and sometimes ages to dingy olive-brown. Unlike many other boletes, it does not turn blue when bruised, although it may have natural blue-green stains. The pores are circular, measuring less than 1 mm, while the tubes extend to 8–14 mm deep. The stipe measures long by thick. It is nearly equal in length throughout or tapered from the top to base. Its color is pale yellow to brownish underneath the pale brown scabers that darken in age.

The spore print color ranges from brown to olive-brown. Spores are spindle shaped, measuring 15–19 long by 5–6 µm. They have a smooth surface, and are inamyloid (i.e., not staining with Melzer's reagent). The cap flesh is bilateral and imamyloid. The cystidia on the pores are present as conspicuous pleuro- and cheilocystidia. The cap cuticle is present as a hymeniform layer. Clamp connections are absent.

Several chemical tests can be used to help verify an identification of "L. rugosiceps". A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray color on the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.

The Costa Rican bolete "Leccinum neotropicalis" is a closely allied species. It is distinguished from "L. rugosiceps" by its dark brown to dark reddish-brown color, and flesh that does not stain with injury. "L. viscosum", found in Belize, features a similar cap and scaber pigmentation on the stipe, and similar color changes in response to injury in the flesh of the cap and the apex of the stipe; unlike "L. rugosiceps", however, it also stains at the stipe base, and the cap is sticky rather than dry.

"L. crocipodium" is a lookalike that is difficult to distinguish from "L. rugosiceps". It generally has a darker cap, paler scabers, and somewhat wider spores, although these characteristics are variable. "L. nigrescens" is also similar to "L. rugosiceps", but has a darker brownish cap and stipe, flesh that slowly stains with injury (reddish, pinkish gray, or purplish black). It is usually found in sandy soil. Another "Leccinum" species that associates with oak is "L. carpini", which also has a wrinkled cap. Unlike "L. rugosiceps", its flesh stains pink to reddish. In his original species description, Charles Peck noted that "L. rugosiceps" grew with "L. rubropunctum", "from which it is easily separated by its dry pileus, smaller tubes and stouter stem."

An edible species, "Leccinum rugosiceps" mushrooms have been described variously as "great", and "of poor quality". They have a nutty flavor and firm texture; older specimens are less firm but retain the flavor. Drying the mushrooms enhances the flavor. The stipe tends to harbor insect larvae and should be cleaned before consumption. The sugar alcohol mannitol is present in the fruitbodies.

"Leccinum rugosiceps" is an ectomycorrhizal fungus that associates with oak. In eastern North America, pin oak ("Quercus palustris") is a frequent host. The bolete fruits singly or in groups in forests, shaded lawns, and often found in areas disturbed by human activity, such as pathsides and picnic areas. Fruiting typically occurs from July to September. A Chinese study evaluating the concentrations of heavy metals in boletes found that in "L. rugosiceps" fruitbodies, the levels of cadmium, zinc, copper, and mercury exceeded that of national safety standards for edible fungi.

The bolete is found from eastern Canada south to Florida and Mississippi, west to Michigan in the United States. The distribution extends south to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia. It is one of several boletes that have a north to south clinal trend. In Asia, the species has been reported from India, Korea, China, and Taiwan. Taiwanese specimens tend to have slightly smaller spores (10–16 by 4–5 μm) than those from mainland China or from America.

Firewatch

Firewatch is an adventure game developed by Campo Santo and published by Campo Santo in partnership with Panic. The game was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4, for Xbox One in September 2016, and for Nintendo Switch in December 2018.

The story follows a fire lookout named Henry in the Shoshone National Forest, a year after the Yellowstone fires of 1988. A month after his first day at work, strange things begin happening to him and his supervisor Delilah, which connects to a conspired mystery that happened years ago. Henry interacts with Delilah using a walkie-talkie, with the player choosing from dialog options to communicate. His exchanges with Delilah inform the process by which their relationship is developed. The game was directed by Olly Moss and Sean Vanaman, written by Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Moss and Vanaman, and produced by Gabe McGill and artist Jane Ng. The game's environment was modelled by Ng, based on a single painting by Moss. The design draws inspiration from New Deal advertisements by the National Park Service and field research conducted in Yosemite National Park.

The game received generally positive reviews, earning praise for its story, characters, dialogue, and visual style. However, the presence of technical issues and the game's ending were both subjects of criticism. "Firewatch" won the award for Best 3D Visual Experience at the Unity Awards 2016, Best Indie Game at the 2016 Golden Joystick Awards, Best Narrative at the 2017 Game Developers Choice Awards and Debut Game at the 2017 British Academy Games Awards. By late 2016, the game had sold over a million copies. Campo Santo partnered with Good Universe to make it into a film.

"Firewatch" is an adventure game played from a first-person view that takes place in the American state of Wyoming in 1989. Players take on the role of Henry, a fire lookout who is assigned to his own tower in Shoshone National Forest. Through exploration of the surrounding area, Henry uncovers clues about mysterious occurrences in the vicinity that are related to the ransacking of his tower while out on a routine patrol and a shadowy figure that occasionally appears watching him from afar.

Henry's only means of communication is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose from a number of dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.

Following the Yellowstone fires of 1988, Henry (Rich Sommer) takes a job as a fire lookout in Wyoming after his wife develops advanced early-onset dementia. On his first day, Delilah (Cissy Jones), a lookout in another watchtower, contacts him via walkie-talkie and asks him to investigate illegal fireworks by the lake. Henry discovers a pair of drunken teenage girls, who accuse him of leering. On his way home he comes across a locked cave and spots a shadowy figure watching him. He returns to his watchtower to find it ransacked. The next day, Delilah asks Henry to investigate a downed communication line. He finds it cut, with a note apparently signed by the teens. He and Delilah plot to scare the girls off, but when he finds the girls' campsite ransacked and abandoned, they begin to worry. A note left at the site blames Henry for wrecking their camp and stealing their belongings.

Later, Henry finds an old backpack and a disposable camera belonging to a boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains was a lookout with his father Ned. Ned was an outdoorsman who drank heavily due to his traumatic experiences in the Vietnam War, while his son, Brian, enjoyed fantasy novels and role-playing games. Though it is against the rules for employees to bring their children to the towers, Delilah was fond of Brian and lied about his presence. He and Ned apparently left abruptly and never returned. The teenage girls are reported missing. Fearing an inquiry, Delilah falsifies reports to say that neither she nor Henry encountered the girls. By the lake the next day, Henry discovers a radio and a clipboard with notes including transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is then knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant. He wakes to find the clipboard and radio gone. In a meadow referred to on the clipboard letterhead he finds a fenced-off government research area. He breaks in and discovers surveillance equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's conversations and private lives. He also discovers a tracking device which he takes with him.

Henry and Delilah discuss destroying the government camp, but decide against it. As Henry hikes home, someone sets fire to the camp. The next day he uses the tracking device to find a backpack with a key to the cave. Delilah reports a figure in Henry’s tower; when Henry arrives, he finds a Walkman taped to the door with an incriminating recording of Henry and Delilah's discussion about destroying the government camp. When Henry enters the cave, someone locks the gate behind him. He escapes through another exit and discovers Brian's old hiding spot, where he went to escape his father when he tried to teach him how to climb. He goes deeper into the cave using climbing equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's decomposed body at the bottom of a cavern. Delilah is upset by the news, blaming herself for allowing Brian to stay. The next day, the fire at the government camp has grown out of control and an evacuation order is given for all the lookouts.

As Henry prepares to leave, the tracking device begins beeping. He follows the signal and discovers a tape with a recording from Ned. Ned claims in the tape that Brian's death was accidental, and that the boy fell due to climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society after Brian's death, Ned admits he has been living in secret in the area ever since and has chosen to venture deeper into the wilderness. Henry finds Ned’s makeshift bunker, along with items stolen from the government camp, the lookout towers, and the teenage girls, who Delilah confirms have been found safe. The government camp was simply studying wildlife; Ned had been using its radio equipment to ensure no one was looking for him and to create transcripts to scare Henry away. Delilah blames Ned for Brian's death and leaves on the helicopter. Henry goes to her tower, and he and Delilah say their goodbyes via radio. Finally, the helicopter arrives and he is evacuated.

"Firewatch" is the first video game from Campo Santo, and was created by Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman, who were the creative leads on "The Walking Dead"; Nels Anderson, the lead designer of "Mark of the Ninja"; and artist Olly Moss. Chris Remo was involved in many aspects of the design, and also composed the score. Development for "Firewatch" began with a single painting by Moss. Jane Ng, lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his stylized artistic vision. Moss, who had previously been known primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to found Campo Santo after spending many years working on the periphery of game development. In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and iconography. The development team went on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park for inspiration for the game, where they visited a lookout tower built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.

"Firewatch" runs on the Unity game engine. Ng disapproved of the tools for creating trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.

The walkie-talkie interaction in "Firewatch" is inspired by the relationship in "BioShock" between the player character and Atlas, as well as the dialog system from "The Walking Dead". At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would be able to communicate with multiple characters, such as hikers, but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working. The team hoped to avoid lip syncing and minimize the amount of animation needed due to the limited team size and resources. The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in "The Walking Dead", as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast Rich Sommer. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on conference calls with each other to achieve a more natural rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.

The game's opening chapter features the song "Push Play" from Joy Chun and Nate Bosley's 2014 synthwave album "Let's Get Electric", which depicts a fictitious 1980s synthpop act known as Cheap Talk. Taylor Dayne's "Tell It to My Heart" was used as a placeholder in the scene, but Vanaman conceded that the song was too overwhelming, and would cost too much to license. Upon the realization that it would also be too costly to commission a song, Remo sought a song in the style of the 1980s by an unsigned, independent artist, leading to the use of "Push Play". The score features a combination of electric and acoustic guitar, bass and electric piano, with samples of Fender Rhodes as a substitute for the actual piano. Remo played all of the instruments himself.

The game was announced in March 2014 with a tentative release date of 2015. At GDC, Campo Santo housed a public playtest, and Ng hosted a panel on the design and aesthetic of the game entitled "The Art of Firewatch". In June 2015, the team visited E3. There, they confirmed that they would be bringing the game to PlayStation 4, but that this would be the only console version. However, an Xbox One version was later released in North America on September 21, 2016, featuring an audio tour and a free roam mode. Due to ratings issues, the version was delayed in Europe until September 30 and in Australia and New Zealand until October 14.

Users of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets can tour Henry's lookout tower using the Steam application Destinations. For this purpose, the scene was rebuilt on the Source game engine. "Firewatch" was made compatible with PlayStation 4 Pro on its November 10 launch, with enhanced performance through 4K resolution and high-dynamic-range imaging. The free roam mode was enabled for PlayStation 4 Pro and Steam shortly thereafter. Partnering with Limited Run Games, Campo Santo distributed under ten thousand physical copies of the game on PlayStation 4. 4,800 copies were made available for order on the Limited Run Games website on December 16, 2016, while 2,500 were sold through the Campo Santo online store starting January 16, 2017. In April 2018, Campo Santo announced the game will be released for Nintendo Switch later in the year. It was later clarified the Nintendo Switch port is a heavily optimised version of the game, and the update will also be available for other platforms. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch version features some exclusive elements. Campo Santo later confirmed, via Twitter, the worldwide release date for the Nintendo Switch port as December 17, 2018.

"Firewatch" received "generally favorable" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game sold more than five hundred thousand copies within a month of its release and over one million copies by the end of its first year. As of 2018, "Firewatch" has sold over 2.5 million copies across all platforms.

Steven Hansen at Destructoid welcomed the choice-based dialog tree gameplay, going on to praise the dialog itself, as well as the voice performances. The game's most impressive achievement, as stated by Hansen, was the "thematic cohesion", which was said to revolve around self-imposed isolation. The sound design was lauded to have evoked a Hitchcockian sense of fear. Reviewing "Firewatch", Game Informer's Jeff Cork wrote, "I was immediately drawn into the game's world, partly because of the power of its simple text intro, and also because of the novelty of taking part in something so mundane". Cork observed that its interactive dialog, though simple, "breathes life into the game" and called the conversations "natural" and "engaging". He enjoyed exploring the forest environment, yet felt the ending was unsatisfactory.

Scott Butterworth of GameSpot thought that the analog navigation tools – a hand-held compass and paper map – were "immersive" but "occasionally frustrating". He found that the visual beauty of the setting allowed for a more rewarding form of exploration and noted that the sound design complemented the depth of its atmosphere. Judging the development of the characters through dialog to be "bold" and "admirable", he opined that it served as "a patient, reflective examination of how two people grow to trust and care for each other". According to Butterworth, the voice acting was brilliant and layered with emotional nuance, as he had evolved a strong attachment to the characters. GamesRadar's Justin Towell described "Firewatch" as "one of the most enthralling slices of entertainment I've ever experienced". He commended the voice acting for having successfully defined each character's personality traits. Towell added that the music, alongside the sound design, worked well in service of the atmosphere. However, he disparaged a few noticeable continuity problems that left him disillusioned.

Ryan McCaffrey at IGN hailed the sense of realism elicited by the setting, despite the stylized level design and artwork. He also approved of the script, saying that voice acting enhanced it further. Of the writing, McCaffrey said, "It's tense, scary, and funny – sometimes all within a few minutes of each other. Not a lot of games can successfully claim that". He deemed the ending polarizing because of the story's promising escalation. Polygon's Colin Campbell appreciated the use of humor and empathy to develop the characters, considered the game's mystery to be successful and the story to be "elegant" and "satisfying". He criticized the conclusion, regarding it as unsuccessful.

In September 2016, it was announced that Campo Santo was partnering with production company Good Universe to adapt the game into a feature film.

Zach Auguste

Zachary Elias Auguste (Greek: Ζαχαρίας Ηλίας "Ζακ" Όγκαστ; born July 8, 1993) is a Greek-American professional basketball player for Galatasaray of the Turkish Basketbol Süper Ligi (BSL) and the EuroCup. He is a 6'10" (2.08 m) center. 
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Auguste started playing high school basketball for Marlborough. In 2011, he moved to the university preparatory New Hampton School in New Hampshire, where he was nominated for the 2012 McDonald's All-American Game. After graduating from New Hampton, Auguste enrolled in the University of Notre Dame, to play college basketball for the Fighting Irish. Spending his freshman and sophomore seasons mainly as a reserve player, Auguste rose to prominence during his junior season in 2014–15, when his team won the ACC Tournament title, and went to the NCAA Elite Eight.

Auguste played at Marlborough High School for three seasons, growing 3 inches in each of these seasons. As a junior in 2009–10, Auguste averaged 22 points and received All-Star accolades from the Mid-Wachusett (Central Massachusetts) league and local newspapers the Telegram & Gazette and The MetroWest Daily News. He scored a total 631 points throughout his career at Marlborough.

He moved to university preparatory New Hampton School after that season, reclassifying to the class of 2012. He cited his desire to get academically and physically ready for college as the main factors behind that decision.
After adapting to the higher competition level, he improved dramatically in time, putting on 28 pounds and developing his post game to transition from a perimeter player to a forward. He finished with an average of 15 points and 8 rebounds for his senior season. Nominated for the 2012 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, he didn't make the final selection.

Soon after joining New Hampton, he was noticed by Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) conference Notre Dame's assistant coach Anthony Solomon, however he later cut the school from his selection list, which included Division I schools West Virginia, Georgia Tech, Florida and Marquette. Despite this, Solomon's steadfast attempts to recruit the player, widely ranked a 4-star recruit, convinced Auguste to visit the campus; he committed to Notre Dame on the spot in September 2011.

Auguste made his debut for Notre Dame in a November 12, 2012 victory against Monmouth, contributing 4 points and 3 rebounds in 3 minutes. After two ankle sprains during pre-season practice, Auguste had difficulty breaking into the already established team. Finding himself behind Jack Cooley and Garrick Sherman in the rotation, he averaged 10.7 minutes per game in 25 games.
Notable were games against Kennesaw State (12 points and 7 rebounds in 12 minutes) and Marquette (a season-high 15 points with 5 rebounds and 3 steals in 21 minutes), for a freshman season average of 3.7 points and 2.7 rebounds.

For the 2013–14 season, Auguste was expected to play a larger role after Cooley graduated and coach Mike Brey cited him as a major player. Though he did start 13 games out of 30, he stayed third choice with Sherman and Tom Knight preferred. He recorded his first college double-double against Clemson having 14 points and 12 rebounds, followed by no-shows. He finished his sophomore season with 6.7 points and 4.3 rebounds in nearly 17 minutes per game on average.

Tabbed as a starter during the preseason, Auguste, as one of the team's few post options, established himself as a starter during his junior season with good performances early in the season, albeit against weaker opposition. A memorable December 13, 2014 game against Florida State, in which he scored a career-high 26 points, started what coach Brey described as a run of key contributions from the forward, with Auguste quickly recouping from his bad performances. In January 2015, Auguste was sidelined by Notre Dame due to academic issues, with the length of the suspension undisclosed. It would ultimately only last three days, with the unknown reason later described as minor by the player. Auguste was seen as a major contributor to the Irish's 2015 ACC Tournament title contributing 16 points and 13 rebounds in the final against North Carolina (for an average of more than 11 points and 9 rebounds in the whole tournament).

In the Round of 64 of the following 2015 NCAA Tournament, Auguste scored 25 points against Northeastern, including two under-pressure free-throws in the final minute of a 69-65 close-fought win. In the next round tie against Butler, he committed a double dribble that conceded possession with two seconds left on the clock in a tied 55-55 game. Butler did not score, and in overtime Auguste blocked a shot before grabbing a rebound - a team-leading 13th - as Notre Dame won to reach the Sweet 16. A comfortable win over Wichita State followed (15 points, 6 rebounds and 1 block for Auguste in 26 minutes) and Notre Dame qualified to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1979. Auguste, described as "Notre Dame's only true post player", was predicted to play an important role in the game against undefeated Kentucky, who - in Karl-Anthony Towns and Willie Cauley-Stein - had some of the biggest forwards of the tournament. He had 20 points and nine rebounds in the game, while mostly defended by Towns. In defense against the same player, he could not stop him from scoring 25 points in a to-the-wire 66-68 loss to the favorites. Auguste finished the tournament with 16.8 points and 8.3 rebounds per game, with 12.9 points and 6.5 rebounds in around 24 minutes for the whole 2014-15 season.

Auguste was elected captain by his teammates for his senior season. He was also voted to the Preseason All-ACC second team. Seven games into the 2015-16 season, Auguste tallied his fifth double-double of the season, tying the total of his first three seasons. He was named as one of ten finalists for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, also earning third team all-ACC honors for the season. In the quarter final of the 2016 ACC Tournament Auguste led his team to an 84–79 win versus Duke, posting a double-double with 19 points and 22 rebounds, setting the Notre Dame's record for most rebounds in a game and tying Tim Duncan's second best performance in the ACC Tournament.

After not being drafted in the 2016 NBA draft, Auguste joined the Los Angeles Lakers' summer league squad for the 2016 Las Vegas Summer League. He appeared in 4 games, and averaged 5.3 points and 4 rebounds per game. On August 29, 2016, he signed a contract with the Lakers, but he was waived on October 12, without playing in any regular season NBA games with the team.

On October 27, he signed with Muratbey Uşak Sportif of the Turkish Super League, for the 2016–17 season. He made his professional debut on November 5, 2016, going scoreless against İstanbul BŞB, in a Turkish BSL game. In January 2017, Auguste scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, to help his team get past Polish team Rosa Radom, which earned him the Game Day 11 MVP award of the Champions League 2016–17 season.

He averaged 11.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 0.6 assists, 0.7 steals, and 0.4 blocks per game, in 23 games played in the Turkish Super League. He also averaged 13.4 points, 8.8 rebounds, 0.6 assists, 0.5 steals, and 0.6 blocks per game, in 11 games played in the European-wide 3rd-tier level Champions League. After his club was parachuted down into the European-wide 4th-tier level FIBA Europe Cup, he averaged 17.8 points, 8.5 rebounds, 0.8 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game, in 4 games played in the FIBA Europe Cup 2016–17 season.

Auguste then played with the Miami Heat's summer league squad for the 2017 Las Vegas Summer League. He averaged 10 points, 5.2 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 0.4 steals, and 0.4 blocks per game in the Las Vegas Summer League, and 7.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 0.3 assists, 2.0 steals, and 0.3 blocks per game in the Orlando Summer League. On June 30, 2017, Auguste signed a one-year deal with Greek club Panathinaikos, at a salary of €500,000 euros net income.

Auguste signed with Galatasaray of the Turkish Basketball Super League (BSL) and the EuroCup on August 7, 2018.

Auguste was selected to the senior Greek national basketball team's 16 man preliminary squad for the EuroBasket 2017.

Auguste was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Jean Bazile Auguste and Lea Tzimoulis. His father, was a former semi-professional soccer player, from Haiti, whose uncle is Christophe Dardompre, a former Colonel of the Haitian Army. His mother is of Greek heritage through her grandfather Louis, who immigrated to the U.S. from Agia Sotira, Greece in 1949.

August has dual citizenship with the United States and Greece. He has stated that he speaks Greek and Haitian Creole fluently, in addition to his native English.

Château de Verteuil

The Château de Verteuil is a historical building in Charente, France. It dates back to 1080 and has since been extensively rebuilt, although 12th century walls remain. The château has always been in the property of the La Rochefoucauld family.

During the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) the château was occupied several times by the English. It was demolished in 1442, but was soon rebuilt using the original stones. In the religious wars of 16th and 17th centuries the château was a base for Huguenot forces, and in 1650 it was partly demolished by royal troops. Another château was erected but it received extensive damage in a fire in 1793 during the French Revolution. The château was renovated in the romantic style after the Bourbon Restoration of 1815, and has been extensively modified since then. During World War II (1939–45) the château housed French troops and refugees from Alsace-Lorraine in 1940 and for several months it was partially occupied by some German units. In 1944 some members of the "maquis" were hidden there. The château was listed as a "monument historique" on 31 March 1966, and obtained full protection on 19 November 2010.

The present château, designed on a triangular plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered traces of the older buildings on the site dating back to the 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung in the master bedroom, were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.

The castle is in a strategic position, dominating the village of Verteuil-sur-Charente and the Charente valley.
In the past it controlled the road from Limoges to La Rochelle, on the route between the courts of France and Spain. The word "Verteuil" was often used in the Middle Ages to designate a fortified place.
Jean Froissart () described it as ""un meult fort chasteau en Poictou sur les marches du Limousin et de la Saintonge"" (a strong castle in Poitou on the borders of Limousin and Saintonge).
The château, a few miles north of Angoulême and in fact in Angoumois, was later used as the country seat of the La Rochefoucauld family.

The Château de Verteuil is recorded in 1080 as the property of the Lord of La Rochefoucauld. Since then the castle has almost always belonged to a member of this family. The first recorded successful siege was in 1135, by Count Wulgrin II of Angoulême (–1140), when the castle belonged to Aymar II de la Rochefoucauld. Hostilities continued between their descendants, William VI of Angoulême (died 1179) and Guy IV of la Rochefoucauld, but had ceased by 1170 when they both attended the dedication of the church of Saint-Amant-de-Boixe. Louis VII of France (1120–80) and Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122–1204) may have stayed at Verteuil in 1137. Eleanor's mother was a Rochefoucauld, and due to the unsettled state of the country the young couple only stayed in safe and preferably well-fortified places in their journey from Bordeaux to Paris.
King Philip VI of France (1293–1350) stayed at the castle in 1332. Due to the Anglo-French hostilities the castle was playing an increasingly important role. During the Hundred Years' War the English were given the castle from 1360 to 1385 by the Treaty of Brétigny. The castle was yielded reluctantly to Edward III of England's regent in France, John Chandos, on 25 October 1361. He had brought the brother of the keeper to the castle and threatened to behead him unless there was an immediate capitulation. French troops commanded by the Duke of Bouillon and Geoffroy III of Rochefoucauld laid siege to the castle in 1380, but it did not yield until five years later. The English later regained the castle, but in 1442 Charles VII of France (1403–61) finally captured it from the English.

The Rochefoucaulds, who had played a major role in the fight against the English, now began to ravish Angoulême. Charles VII returned, and this time destroyed the castle, largely by fire. However, the stones were recovered and the castle rebuilt. In 1446 the Rochefoucaulds managed to obtain the king's pardon and permission to build a defensive wall and two towers in Verteuil to restore the traditional refuge of the villagers. Under this pretext they made the castle among the best defended in France.
The walls were not just restored but also reinforced using the latest techniques.

François I de La Rochefoucauld (died 1541) was the godfather of Francis I of France (1494–1547), who visited Verteuil in 1516. Anne de Polignac, widow of Count François II de la Rochefoucauld, received the Emperor Charles V (1500–1558) in Verteuil on 6 December 1539. Her mother's sister was the wife of the historian Philippe de Commines. She made many improvements to the château, and built the famous library. In 1558 King Henry II of France (1519–59) stayed at Verteuil with his son Charles, Duke of Orleans (1550–74), and his daughter Elizabeth (1545–68), the future wife of Philip II of Spain (1527–98).

François III de La Rochefoucauld (1521–72) became brother-in-law of the Protestant Louis, Prince of Condé (1530–1569), and in 1560 organized a meeting at Verteuil between Condé and the Cardinal Georges d'Armagnac (–1585) legate of Pope Pius IV, in an attempt to prevent further conflict. Two years later François III had thrown in his lot with the Protestants. In 1567 the 6th national synod of the Reformed Church of France was held at the château, and the next year it was a rallying point for Huguenot troops that came to the aid of La Rochelle when it was besieged by Catholics. The château was visited by the future king Henry IV of France (1553–1610), Catherine de' Medici (1519–89) and her daughter, Margaret (1553–1615), Louis XIII of France (1601–43), Anne of Austria (1601–66) and the Queen Mother Marie de' Medici (1575–1642).

In 1650 François VI, Duc de La Rochefoucauld (1613–1680) gathered more than 2,000 knights whom he led to Bordeaux to help the nobles in the second Fronde revolt.
Soon after Charles de La Porte, Marshall of France and Duc de la Meilleraye (1602–64) attacked and took the castle with royal troops.
He destroyed the Orangery and partially demolished the castle. The walls of the north wing were badly damaged, the towers dismantled, the drawbridge removed and the deep ditch that defended the northwest of the castle was partly filled.
The castle remained habitable, and in 1651 was visited by the Prince de Conti, but he was forced to withdraw by soldiers of the Queen's regiment. They installed a garrison of 150 men at Verteuil.

François VI was exiled by Louis XIV of France (1638–1715) after the revolt.
In 1652 François VI returned to the Château de Verteuil, where he spent most of his time until 1659 writing his "Mémoires".
He was restored to favor in 1662 and in 1665 published his "Maximes".
François died in Paris in 1680 but was buried in the Franciscan chapel of Verteuil, which had been founded in 1470 by his ancestor, John, 16th lord of Rochefoucauld and 13th lord of Verteuil. All of John's successors were buried in this chapel until the Reign of Terror began in 1793.

There were some distinguished visitors during the reign of Louis XV of France (1710–1774). Elisabeth Farnese (1692–1766) the second wife of Philip V of Spain (1683–1746), spent time at Verteuil. The English agronomist Arthur Young in his account of a Journey to France in 1787 gave a detailed and flattering description of Verteuil, praising the agricultural improvements and the life of the population.

At the time of the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789–99) there were excellent relations between the La Rochefoucauld family and the people of Verteuil. According to Marquis de Amodio, nothing might have happened to the château if it had not been for Ruffec's Committee of Public Safety and the Convention member Gilbert Romme, who is credited with burning most of the archives at Verteuil and thirty portraits.
A fire accident occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel to the north tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and the upper part of the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.

After the Revolution the senior branch of the Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated in the first half of the 19th century. The work was undertaken by the La Villéons in the romantic style that accompanied the Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added decorations to the windows and made false arrow slots, added two towers to the south facade, added a flamboyant balustrade and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.

During the Second French Empire (1852–70) further changes were made, mainly to the interior. Hippolyte de La Rochefoucauld (1804–63), who had been minister plenipotentiary in Germany and Florence, brought a fine collection of furniture and 18th century Venetian glass chandeliers when he retired. He restored the great stone staircase. Influenced by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc he decided to transform the large East tower into a library. He blocked up the old openings and pierced large new windows in the old walls.
He commissioned a copy of the statue by Didier Début on the facade of the Hôtel de Ville, Paris of the author of the "Maximes".

During World War II (1939–45) the château housed French troops and refugees from Alsace-Lorraine in 1940.
For several months it was partially occupied by some German units. In 1944 some members of the "maquis" were hidden there.
Various extremely interesting archaeological finds have been made since the war.
Research started by Count Gabriel de La Rochefoucauld, which had been interrupted by the war, uncovered a buried part of the castle dating to the 12th and 13th centuries, including the room that housed the drawbridge mechanism.
A 12th century stairway was discovered that led down to a lower chapel from the 11th century, in excellent condition, whose existence was completely unknown before 1958. Various other traces of the early buildings have been found.

The château was listed as a "monument historique" on 31 March 1966, with the facades, roofs and substructure protected.
The site was completely protected on 19 November 2010 as it was believed that the château, the interior courtyard and the land to the north may hold archaeological remains.

The present château with its five conical towers and watchtower capped by slate roofs began to be built in the 15th century, and was altered and extended several times since then. A park was built in the 19th century through which a wide driveway brought visitors to the main building. This is based on a central square tower with a pyramidal roof.
The square keep is the main remaining part of the medieval structure.
The present building is designed on a triangular plan. The large tower at the tip of the triangle is the medieval gatehouse, from which wings extend on either side. An isolated tower that now has the library on two floors divides the curtain wall on the east.

The buildings in the southeast were scarcely affected by the 19th century restoration apart from the chapel. Many of the walls of the 12th century tower have survived, partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and there are traces of a Romanesque chapel. The park was redesigned in the 19th century, enclosed in dry stone walls with several entrances. These have since been removed, as have the luxuriant gardens of the 18th century. Some traces remain in the form of boxwood, some alleys, the pools on the two terraces and the rockery.

An inventory was made in 1728 after the death of Duke Francois VIII.
The library contained 1,069 works.
The master bedroom included an elegant bed with sumptuous fittings of violet velvet embroidered in gold and silver, armchairs upholstered in the same velvet, a large Turkish rug in an alcove, a walnut table and other items.
The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. He designed it as a ""chapelle intellectuelle"" to display memorabilia of the famous author. Adrien Karbowsky contributed decorative murals to the room.
Hippolyte's son, Count Aimery de La Rochefoucauld continued to collect the souvenirs of his ancestors, turning the château into a sort of family museum. He redecorated the chapel and added stained glass windows.

Seven of The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries were recorded in a 1680 inventory of the Paris possessions of Duke Francois VI. From various symbolic motifs, the tapestries seem to have been made to celebrate a marriage, probably that of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515). The royal arms of Louis and Anne would have once decorated the sky in most of the tapestries.

The 1728 inventory recorded five of The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries hanging in the château's master bedroom. The tapestries, which were then well over two hundred years old, were almost half worn out. Two more of the tapestries were in "a large lower hall near the chapel, presently serving as a storage place for furniture". They were described as "two pieces of tapestry of the Unicorn, torn in various places".

During the French Revolution, Ruffec's "Comité de Surveillance" ruled that the old tapestries of the château could be preserved, since they bore no royal insignia. It seems that the insignia had been cut out so the tapestries would not be destroyed by the mob when the château was looted in 1793. They were taken by peasants who used them to protect their potatoes from freezing and to cover their rspalier trees.

Count Hippolyte rediscovered the Unicorn tapestries of the château in the 1850s, being used by a peasant to cover vegetables in his barn. After being restored they were hung in a salon of the château in 1856. Xavier Barbier de Montault saw the tapestries at Verteuil in the 1880s and said that, although "somewhat restored, [they] are of a freshness and of an incomparable grace".

In 1923, the tapestries were sold to John D. Rockefeller Jr. and shipped to New York, where they are now on display in The Cloisters medieval galleries.

DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) is an Internet security policy mechanism which allows domain name holders to indicate to certificate authorities whether they are authorized to issue digital certificates for a particular domain name. It does this by means of a new "CAA" Domain Name System (DNS) resource record. 

It was drafted by computer scientists Phillip Hallam-Baker and Rob Stradling in response to increasing concerns about the security of publicly trusted certificate authorities. It is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed standard.

A series of incorrectly issued certificates from 2001 onwards damaged trust in publicly trusted certificate authorities, and accelerated work on various security mechanisms, including Certificate Transparency to track mis-issuance, HTTP Public Key Pinning and DANE to block mis-issued certificates on the client-side, and CAA to block mis-issuance on the certificate authority side. 

The first draft of CAA was written by Phillip Hallam-Baker and Rob Stradling, and submitted as an IETF Internet Draft in October 2010. This was progressively improved by the PKIX Working Group, and submitted to the IESG as , a Proposed Standard, in January 2013. CA/Browser Forum discussion began shortly afterward, and in March 2017 they voted in favor of making CAA implementation mandatory for all certificate authorities by September 2017. At least one certificate authority, Comodo, failed to implement CAA before the deadline. A 2017 study by the Technical University of Munich found many instances where certificate authorities failed to correctly implement some part of the standard. 

, Qualys reports that still, only 3.4% of the 150,000 most popular TLS-supporting websites use CAA records.

Certificate authorities implementing CAA perform a DNS lookup for CAA resource records, and if any are found, ensure that they are listed as an authorized party before issuing a digital certificate. Each CAA resource record consists of the following components, separated by whitespace:

The lack of any CAA records authorizes normal unrestricted issuance, and the presence of a single blank "issue" tag disallows all issuance.

Third parties monitoring certificate authority behavior might check newly issued certificates against the domain's CAA records, but must be aware that a domain's CAA records may have changed between the time the certificate was issued and the time the third-party checks them. Clients should not use CAA as part of their certificate validation process.

A draft of the first extension to the CAA standard was published on October 26, 2016, proposing a new "account-uri" token to the end of the "issue" property, which ties a domain to a specific Automated Certificate Management Environment account. This was amended on August 30, 2017, to also include a new "validation-methods" token, which ties a domain to a specific validation method, and then further amended on June 21, 2018 to remove the hyphen in "account-uri" and "validation-methods" making them instead "accounturi" and "validationmethods".

To indicate that only the certificate authority identified by "ca.example.net" is authorized to issue certificates for example.com and all subdomains, one may use this CAA record:

To disallow any certificate issuance, one may allow issuance only to an empty issuer list:

To indicate that certificate authorities should report invalid certificate requests to an email address and a Real-time Inter-network Defense endpoint:

To use a future extension of the protocol, for example, one which defines a new "future" property, which needs to be understood by the certificate authority before they can safely proceed, one may set the "issuer critical" flag:

Lo Mejor de...Selena

Lo Mejor de...Selena is a double disc compilation album by American singer Selena. It was released posthumously in the United States on March 31, 2015 by EMI Latin and Universal Music Latin Entertainment. The album was released after the commercial and chart success of "Enamorada de Ti" (2012), which featured several Latin music acts lending their voices for the remix album. The recording features six number one United States "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs chart singles by the singer—"Buenos Amigos", "Donde Quiera Que Estés", "Amor Prohibido", "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", "No Me Queda Más", "Fotos y Recuerdos", and the US "Billboard" Latin Pop Airplay chart single "I Could Fall in Love".

The album debuted and peaked at number two on the US "Billboard" Top Latin Albums chart. A year after its release, the recording peaked at number one on the Latin Pop Albums list, giving Selena her first number one album in four years. "Lo Mejor de...Selena" debuted and peaked at number 102 on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, her highest charting album since 1999's "All My Hits/Todos Mis Exitos". The recording earned the singer the Top Latin Albums Artist of the Year, Female at the 2016 Billboard Latin Music Awards. The album has been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) double platinum, denoting 120,000 album-equivalent units.

In March 1995, American Tejano music singer Selena was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of the singer's boutiques. The impact of the singer's death had a negative impact on Latin music, her genre—which she catapulted it into the mainstream market—suffered and its popularity waned following Selena's death. She continued to be the last remaining Tejano recording artist to appear on the United States "Billboard" 200 chart since 2000. In the fall of 2011, Chilean record producer Humberto Gatica and Capitol Latin senior vice president Sergio Lopes had the idea of turning Selena's songs into duets in popular music genres. Mexican singers Cristian Castro, Samo, American singers Don Omar, Carlos Santana, Selena Gomez (who was named after Selena), and Spanish singer Juan Magan lent their voices for the duet/remix style album. The project—named "Enamorada de Ti"—was released in April 2012 and debuted and peaked at number one on the U.S. Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart. "Lo Mejor de...Selena" followed the commercial success of "Enamorada de Ti", released on the twentieth anniversary of Selena's death. It was also made available for digital download and released as a double disc.

"Lo Mejor de...Selena" contains six "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs chart number one singles by the singer—"Buenos Amigos", "Donde Quiera Que Estés", "Amor Prohibido", "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", "No Me Queda Más", "Fotos y Recuerdos", and "I Could Fall in Love"—the latter of which peaked at number one on the "Billboard" Latin Pop Airplay chart. "Como la Flor", Selena's signature song, and "La Carcacha" are both originally on 1992's "Entre a Mi Mundo". "Como la Flor" launched her on the Latin music scene, according to journalists. The song was acclaimed by music critics and was credited as Selena's first solo number one single in popular culture despite "Billboard"s official record of the single peaking at number six. "No Debes Jugar", the lead single from 1993's "Live!", and "La Llamada" made the album cut. Sally Jacobs of the "Boston Globe" called "No Debes Jugar" one of "her cumbia signature songs" and "most popular cumbia song[s]". "Si Una Vez" peaked at number four on the Regional Mexican Songs chart, while "El Chico del Apartamento 512" failed to gain any chart success. "Techno Cumbia" peaked at number four on "Billboard"s Latin charts.

The second disc of "Lo Mejor de...Selena" contains ten English-language tracks beginning with "My Love"—written by Selena in 1989. The duet with David Byrne on "God's Child (Baila Conmigo)", the English version of "Donde Quiera Que Estes" called "Wherever You Are", and "Dreaming of You" were originally on Selena's posthumous planned crossover album "Dreaming of You" (1995). The latter song became the singer's highest charting "Billboard" Hot 100 single, peaking at number 22 on the chart. It also remains the best-selling single of Selena's musical career, selling over 250,000 digital units. The contemporary R&B ballad "Missing My Baby", the remix version of "My Love" called "Don't Throw Away My Love", and the movie soundtrack songs "Is It the Beat?" and "Disco Medley", were also added to the second disc of the album.

Mexican newspaper "El Diario de Yucatán" called "Lo Mejor de...Selena" an album "that is a recollection of the singer". "Terra Chile" also called the album a way to "remember and honor the legacy of [Selena]" and said that her "departure still lives in the hearts of her fans." The newspaper called the addition of "Disco Medley" on "Lo Mejor de...Selena" as having a "new voice on [the] classics" of "I Will Survive", "Funkytown", and "On the Radio".

The album debuted and peaked at number two on the US "Billboard" Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart on the week ending on April 18, 2015. The set also debuted and peaked at number 102 on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, becoming her fifteenth album to appear on the chart and her highest charting album since 1999's "All My Hits/Todos Mis Exitos". On the Top Latin Albums chart, "Lo Mejor de...Selena" became Selena's fifteenth top 10 album on the chart, selling just over 2,000 units in its first week of availability. Due to the anniversary of Selena's death, her total albums sold 9,000 units a 267% increase from the previous week and her digital songs grew 167% to 26,000 copies sold on the same week. Seven of her songs charted simultaneously on the Latin Digital Song Sales chart, the most Selena had ever placed since "Billboard" began monitoring digital sales for Latin singles in 2010. As of March 2016, "Lo Mejor de...Selena" continued to chart on the Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart for a total of 50 consecutive weeks. "Lo Mejor de...Selena" finished 2015 as the fourteenth best-selling Latin album and the eighth best-selling Latin pop album. In Mexico, the album peaked at numbers 44 and 18 on the Mexican Albums chart and Mexican Spanish Albums chart, respectively. In the week ending April 23, 2016 and following the twenty-first anniversary of Selena's death, "Lo Mejor de...Selena" peaked at number one on the Latin Pop Albums chart. The album dethroned Juan Gabriel's "Los Dúo, Vol. 2" (2015) album, and was the first number one album by the singer in four years.

Selena received the "Billboard" Latin Music Awards for Top Latin Albums Female Artist of the Year and was nominated for Latin Pop Albums Solo Artist of the Year as a result of "Lo Mejor de...Selena"s chart success. After the 2016 "Billboard" Latin Music Awards nominations were announced, Spanish-language channel Telemundo called Selena a "role model for Latinos" and that her "voice continues to echo and touch the hearts of audiences, regardless of gender."

The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge

"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" is the third episode of the second series of the British dark comedy anthology television programme "Inside No. 9". It was written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton, and directed by Dan Zeff. It first aired on 9 April 2015 on BBC Two. The story follows a 17th-century witch trial. Elizabeth Gadge, played by Ruth Sheen, stands accused of witchcraft by inhabitants of the village of Little Happens, including characters played by Sinead Matthews, Jim Howick, Paul Kaye and Trevor Cooper. The magistrate Sir Andrew Pike, played by David Warner, has summoned the famed witch-finders Mr Warren and Mr Clarke, played by Shearsmith and Pemberton, to try Elizabeth, but is more concerned with bringing visitors to the village than finding the truth.

The episode was not intended to be a parody of period dramas, but instead to reflect the absurdity of real witch trials. To that end, the characters take the events of the episode seriously, which leads to much of the humour. The writers' influences included "Witchfinder General", "The Crucible", Monty Python and Hammer Horror films, while the names of the witch-finders were a tribute to the late actor Warren Clarke. Many critics responded positively to the episode, praising the humour—especially that deriving from the use of archaic language—the writing and the performances. Some, however, considered "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" of lower quality than the previous two episodes.

The second series of "Inside No. 9" was written in 2014, and then filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015. The writing process for "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" began with Shearsmith's suggestion of a witch trial as a plot idea, and the writers then worked out the details of the setting. The episode was filmed, mostly in story order, on location in a barn at the Chiltern Open Air Museum. The same location had previously been used for "Doctor Who" and "Horrible Histories". In addition, concurrent with the filming of "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge", a "Drunk History" sketch starring Luke Pasqualino—a previous "Inside No. 9" guest star—was being filmed nearby. Shot in December, "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" was the first episode of the second series to be filmed. The barn was extremely cold during filming; Pemberton joked that, unlike on "Titanic", they would not be digitally adding breath in the production process.

"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" was written to mimic genuine witch trials, some transcripts of which Pemberton and Shearsmith had read as part of the writing process. The fixation of the characters on "teats" and "suckling", for instance, was something Shearsmith had seen in authentic trials. One writing challenge concerned the need for new information to be revealed with each of the trial's witnesses; this is what shaped the structure of the script. For Shearsmith, given that the trials were already absurd, they cannot be parodied. The humour of the episode, for him, comes precisely from the fact that the characters take the events so seriously, and do not see this absurdity. Pemberton said that the pair aimed for authenticity, and did not seek to produce a spoof of a period piece. To that end, he was complimentary of Yves Barr, a costume designer with whom the writers had worked for a number of years, who did "a fantastic job creating this period on a shoestring". Given that, in his view, "people don't do this period", Shearsmith was excited to film something set in the 17th century. The episode was the only period piece in the first two series, but the writers expressed willingness to do another; they felt that the setting showed that they really could go anywhere with the programme.

As each episode of "Inside No. 9" features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" starred Pemberton and Shearsmith as Mr Warren and Mr Clarke respectively, along with David Warner as Sir Andrew Pike and Ruth Sheen as Elizabeth Gadge. Warner had previously worked with Pemberton and Shearsmith on "The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse", and the writers thought him very well-suited to the role as Sir Andrew Pike. Shearsmith considered Sheen a very capable actress, and complimented the way she played Gadge as a serious character; Pemberton felt she added "gravitas" to the role. Sinead Matthews starred as Sarah Nutter, Jim Howick as Thomas Nutter, Paul Kaye as Richard Two-Shoes, and Trevor Cooper as George Waterhouse. Shearsmith was particularly pleased to have Howick appearing in the episode. As he had appeared in "Horrible Histories", he added, for Shearsmith, "a weight of royalty". The "comic coupling" of Howick and Matthews had characters who were originally, mistakenly, named "Gadge", but this did not fit with the characters' relationship with the titular Elizabeth. The couple were renamed "Nutter", a reference to Alice Nutter of the real-world Pendle witch trials.

In addition to the credited actors, the crew had a crowd of extras for one day of filming. Around 12 extras were used; budget constraints allowed this number for a day, or five extras for two days. This constraint led to a change in the script, seeing the crowd removed from the trial. Although uncredited, Goody Two-Shoes was played by an actress who had appeared in "Psychoville", one of Pemberton and Shearsmith's previous productions, as Joanne Dunderdale, an understudy. The writers were complimentary of Cooper's performance; they said that he was almost "conducting" the crowd of extras, in that they were noisy when he was shouting, and quiet when he stopped.

In addition to the use of visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after the first day of the trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and a discussion about the stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.

In 17th century England, the magistrate Sir Andrew Pike (Warner) summons the witch-finders Mr Warren (Shearsmith) and Mr Clarke (Pemberton) to the village of Little Happens. Seventy-year-old Elizabeth Gadge (Sheen) has been accused of witchcraft, and Pike is excited that the news has attracted the attention of outsiders. Pike and Warren already seem convinced of Gadge's guilt, but Clarke remains sceptical.

Elizabeth's case is brought to trial the following morning, with the assistance of the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth says that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat; Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.

Clarke privately tells Warren that he thinks Elizabeth is innocent and that he is not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.

"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" is a period piece tribute to "Witchfinder General", "The Blood on Satan's Claw" and "The Crucible", while the names "Warren" and "Clarke" are a homage to British actor Warren Clarke, who, at time of production and airing, had recently died. The names were selected prior to Clarke's death—specifically because they were amusing but period appropriate, and not because the actor had any link to the episode's themes—but the writers chose to keep them as a tribute upon the death of Clarke, with whom Shearsmith had previously worked. The style and humour is reminiscent of "Horrible Histories" and Monty Python. For instance, one scene was directly inspired by the "laughing guard" scene in "Monty Python's Life of Brian". Pemberton and Shearsmith themselves, however, did not consider the episode to be particularly reminiscent of Monty Python. The humour is childish, but many of the jokes are "bawdy" and "adult".

Though one critic said that the episode was "the first straight-up comedic episode of the second series", another said that the episode's humour was balanced with tragedy and poignancy, arguing that the whole episode has an element of horror. This was especially true given that the story reflects actual happenings; the depiction of torture was described as "genuinely upsetting". Despite the sole setting of the barn, the episode evokes a degree of folk horror. "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" was described by Jonathan Wright ("The Guardian") and Phoebe Jane-Boyd (Den of Geek) as like a Hammer Horror film with added humour, and writers for the "Irish Examiner" said that the episode should appeal to both horror and comedy fans.

Given that Gadge is revealed to actually be a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly had witnessed Gadge engaging in some kind of supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by greed. However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must have been based on some level of belief.

Critics generally responded warmly to the episode, but some felt it compared poorly to others in the series. David Chater, writing for "The Times", felt that "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" was dissimilar from any previous episode of "Inside No. 9", but that it was "equally accomplished", while in sister publication "The Sunday Times", critics suggested that the change in style showed the writers' versatility. Neela Debnath, writing for "The Independent", called "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" a "hilariously dark little half-hour of quintessentially British comedy". Rupert Hawksley, writing for "The Daily Telegraph", was more critical. He awarded "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" three out of five stars, saying that "despite a starry cast and a delightful twist and counter-twist, [the episode] was nothing like as effective" as "La Couchette" and "The 12 Days of Christine", the previous two episodes of the series. The episode, he claimed, was indicative of a "mid-series lull". The freelance journalist Dan Owen felt the episode was "entertaining fare, but too predictable and clichéd to prove genuinely memorable", awarding it two out of four stars. He, too, said the episode felt like "a mid-series misstep". Shearsmith was unhappy with those who thought the episode a "dud" or a "misfire", confessing that it was his favourite episode of the second series. Pemberton felt it was going to be difficult to follow "The 12 Days of Christine", but Shearsmith was of the view that the episodes should not be in competition with each other.

The episode's humour was praised by the majority of commentators. Julia Raeside, writing for "The Guardian", said the writers "managed to pull together a loving tribute to [their] cult horror source material with an all-out gag rate that most sitcoms would fail to keep up with", claiming that "they get the look and tone just right and then inject it with the kind of comedy that is perfectly tailored to puncture the fictional world without deflating it". Similarly, Debnath felt that the jokes, including "anachronistic references" and "dark punnery", were "bang on". By contrast, Hawksley claimed that the episode had several "inspired moments", including a "perfectly pitched" joke about selfies, but that the writers had failed to properly exploit the 17th-century setting. Overall, though finding it "occasionally funny", Hawksley thought the episode "fell some way short of what we have come to expect from Pemberton and Shearsmith". For the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, the episode was "all the more hauntingly funny because it is played pretty straight", but he noted that the character of Sir Andrew Pike allowed "some offbeat humour". Chater called the episode "very, very funny", and Philip Cunnington, of the "Lancashire Evening Post", called it "one of the funniest half-hours of TV so far this year" after the conclusion of the series.

Television critics praised the writing and acting of "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge". Though Owen felt that the ending "held little surprise", Paddy Shennan, of the "Liverpool Echo", said he "loved the fact that, for the third week running, [he] couldn't work out the twist". For Debnath, "the best was saved till last", but the whole episode was "tightly written". Patrick Mulkern ("Radio Times"), too, said that "this dark tale soon works a devilish spell". Christine Brandel, writing for entertainment website "PopMatters", particularly praised the episode's "beautifully done" dialogue, saying that "it feels authentic in its phrasing, even during the more bizarre (and hilarious) court scenes". Owen, similarly, said "the dialogue was also frequently hilarious, with Shearsmith and Pemberton having a fine ear for the rhythms of Olde English and how best to have characters deadpan their way through some ridiculous sentences." Hawksley praised Warner's "effortlessly batty" performance as Sir Andrew Pike, and claimed that Sheen "brought an unsettling complexity" to the title character. Gerard Gilbert, of "The Independent", claimed Warner was clearly "having a ball" as Pike, and Wright ("The Guardian") said "Warner quite brilliantly makes the most of every line he's given". Brandel considered Warner one of the best guest stars of the series.

2015–16 York City F.C. season

The 2015–16 season was the 94th season of competitive association football and 79th season in the Football League played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. Their 18th-place finish in 2013–14 meant it was their fourth successive season in League Two. The 2015–16 season ran from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016.

Russ Wilcox made six permanent summer signings, as he approached his first full season as York manager. In October 2015, Wilcox was sacked with York 21st in the table, following a nine-match run without a win. He was replaced by former Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara in November 2015. However, York never ranked higher than 22nd place under McNamara, and were relegated into the National League after finishing bottom of the 24-team 2015–16 League Two. They lost in their opening round match in the 2015–16 FA Cup, and were eliminated in the second round of the League Cup and the Northern section quarter-final of the Football League Trophy.

42 players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were 18 different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Scott Flinders missed only three of the 51 first-team matches over the season. Vadaine Oliver finished as leading scorer with 10 goals, of which seven came in league competition, one came in the FA Cup and two came in the Football League Trophy. The winner of the Clubman of the Year award, voted for by the club's supporters, was defender Dave Winfield.

The 2014–15 season was Nigel Worthington's second start to a season as manager of York City, having taken charge in March 2013. Worthington resigned in October 2014 with York one place above the relegation zone. He was replaced by Russ Wilcox, who had led Scunthorpe United to promotion from League Two last season before being sacked with them struggling in League One. York secured safety from relegation with more than two weeks of the season remaining, and finished in 18th place in the 2014–15 League Two table.

Ahead of 2015–16, York released Wes Fletcher, Ryan Jarvis, Lewis Montrose and Daniel Parslow, while Jason Mooney left for Accrington Stanley. Josh Carson, Michael Ingham and Tom Platt were retained with new contracts. York made nine summer signings, those being goalkeeper Scott Flinders from Hartlepool United, defenders Taron Hare and Eddie Nolan from Scunthorpe United, George Swan from Wolverhampton Wanderers, David Tutonda on loan from Cardiff City and Stéphane Zubar on loan from AFC Bournemouth, midfielder James Berrett from Yeovil Town, and strikers Vadaine Oliver from Crewe Alexandra and Reece Thompson from Frickley Athletic. Midfielder Callum Rzonca entered the first-team squad from the youth team after agreeing a professional contract.

New home and away kits were introduced for the second successive summer. The home kit included red shirts with a navy blue diagonal stripe, red shorts and red socks. The away kits featured black shirts with yellow trims on each shoulder and on each side, black shorts with yellow trims on each side and block socks. Benenden Health continued as shirt sponsors for the fourth successive season.

York's first match was away to last season's League Two play-off finalists, Wycombe Wanderers, which they lost 3–0. Anthony Stewart opened the scoring with a header before Aaron Amadi-Holloway scored from a low shot, and Zubar scored an own goal when his attempted back-pass lobbed Flinders. York then played League One team Bradford City at home in the first round of the League Cup, and the visitors took the lead in the first half through a Christopher Routis volley. Luke Summerfield equalised with a penalty in the 49th minute, and after Bradford missed a penalty 20 minutes from time, Berrett scored a free kick in the 85th minute. James Hanson headed an equaliser for Bradford in stoppage time, and the match ended 2–2 after extra time. York won the penalty shoot-out 4–2, and Flinders saved two penalties before Carson scored the winning spot kick. York lost 2–1 to Hartlepool United in their first home league match of the season, despite taking the lead in the 57th minute when Thompson scored after Hartlepool failed to clear Summerfield's cross. Billy Paynter curled a shot into the top corner before Michael Woods scored the winner for Hartlepool in the 81st minute, after his miskicked shot took a touch off Berrett.

York picked up their first points of the season after they beat Yeovil Town 1–0 at home, in which Berrett scored in the 63rd minute with a deflected 20-yard shot. This was followed by a 0–0 away draw with Exeter City, in which Zubar was carried off injured. Following the match, Lindon Meikle was released by mutual consent, having failed to make a matchday squad in the first five matches of the season. York were beaten 3–0 away by Swansea City of the Premier League in the League Cup third round, with Nathan Dyer, Matt Grimes and Marvin Emnes scoring their goals. Zubar returned to Bournemouth after he suffered cruciate ligament damage during the Exeter match. Platt was loaned to National League North team Harrogate Town for three months. Thompson gave York a sixth-minute lead with a close-range finish in a home match against Mansfield Town. The away team scored twice later in the first half through Matt Green, and York lost the match 2–1.

York achieved their first away win of the season after beating bottom-of-the-table Newport County 3–0. Berrett opened the scoring in the first half with a shot into the bottom corner, and in the second half Thompson scored a header before Oliver scored with a close-range finish. York drew 2–2 away to Stevenage, and took the lead in the 39th minute with a Nolan shot from the edge of the penalty area. Chris Whelpdale and Charlie Lee scored for Stevenage in quick succession early in the second half, and Summerfield equalised with a curling shot on 74 minutes, before Flinders saved a late Brett Williams penalty. Striker Rhys Turner joined on a one-month loan from Oldham Athletic, and made his debut in York's 2–2 home draw with Carlisle United. York were 2–0 down at half-time, before Oliver was sent off for an off-the-ball incident early in the second half. However, within a two-minute period, Summerfield scored a penalty and Carson converted an Emile Sinclair cross to bring the score to 2–2.

York were beaten 1–0 away by Notts County, whose goal came in the 12th minute when Izale McLeod capitalised on a mistake by Flinders. Platt was recalled from his loan at Harrogate, where he made six appearances, after Summerfield sustained back and head injuries in the match against Notts County. York lost 2–1 at home to Oxford United; having gone behind, Turner scored an equaliser after confusion between Sam Slocombe and Johnny Mullins in the penalty area, but the away team scored the winning goal in the second half. Striker Ben Hirst went on a one-month loan to Northern Premier League Division One North club Scarborough Athletic, having had limited chances in the team.

Midfielder Michael Collins joined on a one-month loan from Oxford, as cover for the injured Nolan and Summerfield. Michael Coulson scored with a low shot to give York a 50th-minute lead at home to Cambridge United, and John McCombe scored four minutes later with a curling shot to make the score 2–0. However, Mark Roberts and Barry Corr scored for Cambridge in the last 19 minutes, and the match finished a 2–2 draw. York knocked League One team Doncaster Rovers out of the Football League Trophy in the second round with a 2–0 home win. Oliver gave York an early lead with a header into the bottom corner from an Anthony Straker cross, and he doubled the lead early into the second half; after dispossessing Aaron Taylor-Sinclair he lifted the ball over the advancing goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, before hitting the ball into an empty net. York ended Luton Town's four-match winning streak with a 1–1 away draw; Lowe scored late into the first half with a shot into the top of the goal, before Luton equalised in the second half from a Cameron McGeehan penalty. Turner's loan was extended for a second month. York were beaten 3–1 away by Barnet, who had been on a three-match losing streak. After going behind to John Akinde's goal, Coulson equalised for York in the 80th minute with a drilled shot, but goals in the last 10 minutes from Michael Gash and Josh Clarke secured a win for the home team.

Oliver scored a tap-in to give York a 14th-minute lead at home to Dagenham & Redbridge, before the away team equalised through Ashley Hemmings later in the first half.

Cresswell's first match in charge was a 1–0 away defeat to Crawley Town, who scored in the 86th minute with a Simon Walton penalty.

Former Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara was appointed as Wilcox's successor, with Simon Donnelly joining as his assistant. McNamara's first match in charge was a 3–2 away defeat in the FA Cup first round to Accrington Stanley, who took the lead on 29 minutes through Sean McConville, before Oliver equalised for York five minutes later with a close-range finish. Matt Crooks put Accrington back in front two minutes later and Josh Windass scored a penalty early into the second half, before Coulson scored a consolation goal for York with a stoppage time header. York were eliminated from the Football League Trophy after being beaten 2–1 away by Barnsley in the Northern section quarter-final. Coulson opened the scoring for York on 40 minutes with a free kick into the top-left corner, before the League One team scored in the second half through Ben Pearson and Adam Hammill. Greening, who began his career at the club, registered as a player on non-contract terms aged 36, to provide cover with a number of midfielders unavailable. York were beaten 2–1 at home by league leaders Plymouth Argyle, who were two goals up by half-time with goals from Jake Jervis and Graham Carey. Dave Winfield was stretchered off with his neck in a brace during the second half, and Ben Godfrey scored a consolation goal for York during the 10 minutes of stoppage time that followed. Defender Will Boyle, the Huddersfield Town under-21 captain, was signed on a youth loan until January 2016.

York were beaten 3–2 away by Leyton Orient, who took a two-goal lead through Mathieu Baudry and Jay Simpson before Oliver equalised in first-half stoppage time. Orient restored their two-goal advantage through Simpson in the second half, and Oliver scored a consolation goal with a header in the 86th minute. York were beaten 6–0 away by Portsmouth, in which Greening was sent off before half-time for catching Michael Doyle with his elbow, before Ben Davies and Marc McNulty gave the home team the lead early in the second half. McNulty scored two more goals before Ben Tollitt and Conor Chaplin finished the scoring for Portsmouth; this result saw York drop into the relegation zone for the first time in 2015–16. York signed five players before the deadline for loan transfers: defenders Mark Kitching from Middlesbrough and Stefan O'Connor from Arsenal, midfielders Jordan Lussey from Bolton Wanderers and Kenny McEvoy from Tottenham Hotspur, and striker Bradley Fewster from Middlesbrough. Winger Danny Galbraith, released by Gillingham at the end of last season, was signed before the deadline for free transfers. Collins, Morris, Turner and Tutonda were sent back to their parent clubs. York suffered another heavy defeat after losing 5–1 at home to Accrington, who were two goals up at half-time with goals from Matty Pearson and Billy Kee. Josh Windass scored a penalty for Accrington after O'Connor tripped Tom Davies, and Kee scored their fourth before Fewster scored for York with a shot into the bottom corner on 75 minutes. Shay McCartan finished the scoring for Accrington late into the match, and the result meant York equalled a club record of eight straight defeats.

Lowe left the club by mutual consent, having earlier been made available for loan by McNamara. Goalkeeping coach Andy Leaning left the club, and was replaced by Craig Hinchliffe, who worked with McNamara at Dundee United. Lussey's loan came to a premature end, after he tore a muscle.

Jermaine Easter equalised for Rovers on 71 minutes, before Matty Taylor scored their winning goal in stoppage time. Cresswell and Greening left the club by mutual consent, while Steve Torpey returned as youth-team coach. York won for the first time in 10 matches after beating Morecambe 2–1 at home, which saw them move out of the relegation zone.

York drew 1–1 away to Mansfield, taking the lead on 10 minutes when Winfield touched in Summerfield's free kick, before the home team equalised later in the first half through Krystian Pearce.

York dropped to the bottom of the table after being beaten 1–0 away by Yeovil, who in turn moved above York; their goal came from a Matthew Dolan penalty scored late in the first half. Fewster's loan was extended to the end of the season, while McEvoy was signed permanently for the rest of 2015–16. Burnley right-back Luke Hendrie and Newcastle United centre-back Kyle Cameron were signed on one-month loans, while Ntumba Massanka joined on loan from Burnley until the end of the season. Godfrey joined Premier League club Norwich City for an undisclosed fee, believed to be £150,000, with further clauses that could take the figure to £1 million if met. The money was to be invested on strengthening the team, and York immediately replaced Godfrey with Hull City midfielder Matty Dixon, who signed a one-and-a-half-year contract on a free transfer. York lost 1–0 at home to fellow strugglers Newport, who had only appointed their manager Warren Feeney a day earlier. The loss came after Aaron Collins scored in the eighth minute. Marvin McCoy and Straker left the club by mutual consent, while McCombe and Nolan were also offered severance packages.

York drew 1–1 away with Carlisle, who took the lead early in the first half through Jason Kennedy, before Summerfield equalised for York on 87 minutes after Fewster's shot hit the post. Nolan left by mutual consent, before Hendrie had his loan extended to the end of the season. Platt returned to Harrogate on a one-month loan, while Ľubomír Šatka, a Slovakia under-21 international, joined one a one-month youth loan from Newcastle.

Keith Keane scored an equaliser for Stevenage on 78 minutes, before Galbraith scored the winning goal in the third minute of stoppage time, with a low shot in off the post from the edge of the penalty area.

On transfer deadline day, McCombe left the club after agreeing a severance package, and Sinclair joined National League club Guiseley on a one-month loan. York lost 2–0 away to top-of-the-table Northampton Town, who scored in each half through John-Joe O'Toole and Marc Richards, and had Hendrie sent off for a foul on Ricky Holmes. Cameron's loan was extended until the end of the season, having impressed in his four starts for the club. York won successive home wins for the first time in 2015–16 after they beat Notts County 2–1, a result that saw them move off the bottom of the table into 23rd place. Coulson opened the scoring on 24 minutes after lobbing goalkeeper Roy Carroll from 15 yards before Fewster scored from close range from McEvoy's cross in the 39th minute. County recorded a consolation goal after Šatka scored an own goal in the second half. York moved out of the relegation into 22nd place with a 2–0 home win over Exeter, and in doing so ended the club's longest run without a clean sheet since 1967, after 23 matches. Fewster scored both goals, the first in the 35th minute with a low shot at close range from Coulson's pass, and the second in the 64th minute with a shot from the edge of the penalty area.

John Marquis doubled Northampton's lead early into the second half, and Russell Penn scored a consolation goal for York with a 25-yard dipping volley in the third minute of stoppage time. Huddersfield's Boyle rejoined on loan until the end of the season, while Hare was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Stamford for one month. York were beaten 3–2 at home by Luton, Cameron McGeehan giving the visitors the lead early in the second half before Fewster equalised in the 62nd minute after rounding goalkeeper Mark Tyler. After Jack Marriott restored Luton's lead, Fewster scored York's second goal on 82 minutes before Olly Lee scored a solo goal to win the match for the visitors in stoppage time. Šatka's loan from Newcastle was extended to the end of the season. Fewster was named the League Two Player of the Month for February 2016, having scored five goals over the month.

York lost 4–0 away to third-place Oxford, in what was only their first home league win of 2016, with a first-half goal from Jordan Bowery and second-half goals from Chey Dunkley, Danny Hylton and Kemar Roofe. Platt and Sinclair's respective loans at Harrogate and Guiseley were extended for a further month. York were beaten 1–0 away by bottom-of-the-table Dagenham, which meant they moved to within two points of York. Penn was sent off in the 57th minute for handling the ball on the goal line, and the resulting Joss Labadie penalty was saved by Flinders, before Dagenham scored the only goal through Josh Passley on 78 minutes. York signed Rochdale striker Lewis Alessandra on a one-month emergency loan and Notts County defender Scot Bennett on loan for the rest of 2015–16, while Massanka was recalled by Burnley. The team drew 1–1 at home with Barnet, which combined with Hartlepoool's win over Dagenham meant York were seven points adrift of safety. Alessandra gave York the lead 20 minutes into his debut with a shot from 10 yards after Jake Hyde hit the post, before Barnet equalised shortly before half-time through Akinde. Rzonca joined Stamford on a one-month loan, with Hare's loan at the club extended to the end of the season.

York were beaten 2–1 away by AFC Wimbledon, and they took the lead in the 38th minute when Penn rebounded in Oliver's blocked shot. Rhys Murphy equalised for AFC Wimbledon on 68 minutes, before Jake Reeves scored with a 30-yard volley in the third minute of stoppage time. Platt's contract with York was terminated by mutual consent, allowing him to join Harrogate permanently. York remained seven points adrift of safety with a 2–2 draw at home to Crawley, who took the lead on five minutes through Matt Harrold before Summerfield equalised for York with a 30th-minute penalty after Alessandra was fouled by Jon Ashton in the penalty area. Liam McAlinden put Crawley back in the lead on 48 minutes, before Coulson scored York's equaliser with a curling 15-yard shot in the 69th minute. York had fallen three goals behind away to promotion-chasing Plymouth by the 42nd minute of a 3–2 defeat, who scored through Jamille Matt, Reuben Reid and a Boyle own goal. Penn brought York back into the match with a drilled shot on 52 minutes, before Summerfield scored a penalty in the 86th minute.

York moved to being nine points from safety after drawing 1–1 at home to Orient, in which York took the lead in the 17th minute when Fewster converted Summerfield's cross from three yards.

York took the lead when Oliver scored his first goal since December 2015 with a 10-yard shot into bottom corner on 35 minutes, before Matt Bloomfield equalised for Wycombe in the 88th minute. Alessandra's loan was extended to the end of the season, after scoring once in six appearances. York were left on the verge of relegation from League Two after a 2–1 away defeat to Hartlepool, with the team 11 points adrift of safety with four fixtures remaining. York went behind on 24 minutes to Nathan Thomas's goal, and 11 minutes later Winfield was sent off for a second yellow card. Cameron equalised for York in first-half stoppage time with a header from Summerfield's corner, before Michael Woods scored Hartlepool's winning goal on 72 minutes.

York won for the first time in 13 matches after beating Portsmouth 3–1 at home, but were left nine points adrift of safety with three matches remaining. Fewster headed York into the lead on 30 minutes and Alessandra scored with a low shot four minutes later. Summerfield made it 3–0 three minutes after half-time with a 30-yard shot, before Portsmouth scored a consolation goal through Gareth Evans in the 55th minute. York's relegation into the National League was confirmed after a 3–0 away defeat to Accrington, marking the end of a four-year spell in the Football League. Promotion-chasing Accrington opened the scoring in the first half through Tariqe Fosu, before Josh Windass scored twice in the second half. York were beaten 4–1 by promotion-chasing Bristol Rovers in their last home match of the season, dropping to the bottom of the table as a result. Billy Bodin scored Rovers' first two goals before Jermaine Easter and Lee Mansell scored either side of McEvoy's 81st-minute goal, a close-range finish from Fewster's low cross from the left. Before the match, Winfield was named the 2015–16 Clubman of the Year, voted for by the club's supporters. York's last match of the season was a 1–1 away draw with Morecambe, in which they took the lead after Summerfield scored in first-half stoppage time, before the home team equalised through Jamie Devitt. This meant York's final league position in 2015–16 was bottom place, being relegated alongside 23rd-place Dagenham.

York released Carson, Hare, Hirst, Femi Ilesanmi, McEvoy, Riordan, Sinclair and Swan after the season ended. Berrett, Coulson, Hyde and Penn left to join Grimsby Town, St Johnstone, Stevenage and Carlisle respectively, while Ingham, Summerfield and Winfield rejected new contracts.

Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos

Nikephoros Phokas (, –15 August 1022), surnamed Barytrachelos (Βαρυτράχηλος, "heavy-neck"; Armenian: "Cṙ[a]viz", "Ts'arvezi", "wry-neck"), was a Byzantine aristocrat and magnate, the last major member of the Phokas family to try to claim the imperial throne. He was a son of the general Bardas Phokas the Younger and great-nephew of Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, and played an active role in his father's failed rebellion against Basil II in 987–989. After the death of his father, he sought and received Basil's pardon. Nothing further is known of him until 1022 when, along with the general Nikephoros Xiphias, he launched another rebellion. The revolt gathered widespread support, but mistrust between the two leaders led to Phokas' assassination by Xiphias on 15 August 1022. The rebellion collapsed quickly after that.

Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos was a son of the general Bardas Phokas the Younger, and had one older brother, Leo. In spring 970, following the murder of Barytrachelos' great-uncle Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas by John I Tzimiskes, his father tried to raise a rebellion against the new regime in the family's base at Cappadocia. Tzimiskes dispatched his lieutenant Bardas Skleros against Bardas Phokas. Skleros was able to lure away many of Phokas' supporters, until he was forced to surrender. Although not explicitly mentioned in the sources, Nikephoros probably shared his father's fortune, being exiled to the Aegean island of Chios with the rest of his family.

In 978, after Tzimiskes' death and the rise of Basil II to the throne, Bardas Phokas was recalled to lead the imperial forces against his old rival Bardas Skleros, who had rebelled and seized much of Asia Minor. After early reverses, the loyalist forces under Phokas proved victorious in spring 979, forcing Skleros to flee to Byzantium's eastern Muslim neighbours, finding refuge in the Buyid court at Baghdad. 

In 987, however, Bardas Skleros was released from Baghdad and tried to raise another revolt. He contacted Bardas Phokas for a common undertaking against Basil II, but Phokas deceived and imprisoned Skleros, before finally launching his own uprising by proclaiming himself emperor in August/September 987. It is here that Nikephoros is named for the first time in the sources: his father sent him to David III of Tao to secure military aid, and to confront the loyalist general Gregory Taronites, who had landed in the Phokades' rear at Trebizond and had raised an army of Armenians in the eastern provinces. Nikephoros secured 1,000 Georgian soldiers from David and defeated Taronites, but soon after that news reached him of the death of his father at the Battle of Abydos on 13 April 989. Bardas Phokas' demise led to the immediate collapse of the rebellion: the Georgians returned to their country, and Nikephoros' troops dispersed to their homes. Nikephoros fled to the fortress of Tyropoion, where his mother resided and where the imprisoned Bardas Skleros was held. Along with his brother Leo, Nikephoros now supported Skleros' candidacy as emperor, but the latter, old and weary, preferred to give up the struggle and submit to the emperor in exchange for leniency. Like Bardas Skleros, Nikephoros received a pardon, and was allowed to retain his privileges. Leo on the other hand tried to resist from his base at Antioch, but the city's inhabitants surrendered him to Basil.

Nothing is heard of Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos until the summer of 1022, when he conspired with the general Nikephoros Xiphias against Basil II, who since spring had been engaged in a campaign against the Georgian king George I. The two conspirators aimed to overthrow Basil and have one of them replace him, but the issue of who would have precedence was unresolved, and would lead to the rebellion's quick downfall. Although Xiphias held the prestigious post of "strategos" of the Anatolic Theme and Phokas held no office but the title of "patrikios", according to the report of the contemporary Christian Arab historian Yahya of Antioch, great numbers of aristocrats flocked to him due to his family's influence, provoking Xiphias' envy.
The rebellion of the two men was particularly threatening to the emperor, as it took control over Cappadocia and threatened to cut off his rear and leave him stranded between two enemies. Indeed, the conspirators are said to have been in contact with George I for that purpose. Basil first withdrew to the safety of the fortress of Mazdat, and according to John Skylitzes sent an envoy to the rebel leaders aiming to sow distrust between them, while according to Yahya the emperor appointed as the new governor of the Anatolic Theme Theophylact Dalassenos and sent him to suppress the revolt. Whether the envoy accomplished his task is unknown, but on 15 August 1022, Xiphias arranged a meeting with Phokas, where the latter was murdered by one of Xiphias' servants. Armenian sources however report, rather dubiously, that Phokas was killed by the former king of Vaspurakan, Senekerim-Hovhannes, or his son David, or one of their followers. The severed head was sent to Basil, who mounted it on a stake and put it on public display at Mazdat.

Following the death of Phokas, the rebellion collapsed, and Xiphias was arrested and forced to become a monk. Released from the threat to his rear, Basil II swiftly and decisively defeated George I, and imposed his terms on him. The other supporters of the uprising were imprisoned and released in 1025, after the death of Basil II and the succession of his younger brother, Constantine VIII. In 1026, however, Constantine VIII accused the last surviving member of the once great family, Bardas Phokas (possibly a son or nephew of Nikephoros Barytrachelos), of plotting against the throne, and had him blinded.

Bass Maltings, Sleaford

The Bass Maltings in Sleaford, England are a large group of eight disused malt houses originally owned by the Bass Brewery of Burton upon Trent. Constructed between 1901 and 1907 to Herbert A. Couchman's design, the maltings are the largest group of malt houses in England; they have been designated Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England, recognising them as "particularly important ... of more than special interest."

Part of the predominantly agricultural county of Lincolnshire, the Sleaford area was a major producer of barley in the 1880s. When germinated and dried to form malt, barley forms a key ingredient in the production of beer. Along with the town's railway links, this attracted the Bass brewery company to the town. The use of more efficient techniques at Bass's other plant led to the closure of Sleaford's maltings in 1959. Despite being used to rear poultry in the late 20th century, the buildings have not been fully occupied since Bass left and a fire in 1976 caused severe damage to three of the malthouses. Derelict since the 1990s, proposals to convert the buildings into office, retail and residential space were put on hold in early 2015 after lengthy delays over planning permission and the withdrawal of a major investor.

In the late-19th century, the Sleaford area was a major barley producer and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, Spalding and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable for the production of malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd were attracted to the town and in 1880 proposed a new malting complex there, which would consolidate malting closer to the barley source and reduce costs by up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable artesian water sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.

The company ran the complex at full capacity until after the Second World War; however, in the 1950s, Bass installed new and more efficient pneumatic malting systems at their original Burton-on-Trent plant, making the Sleaford complex redundant and paving the way for its closure in 1959. Vacant space was let to businesses, but the enormous complex was only ever partially occupied after Bass left. Vulnerable to damage and poorly maintained, fires started in 1969 and 1976, the latter resulting in major damage to three of the malthouses. Some of the space was used for chicken-rearing by G. W. Padley (Property) Ltd. from 1973 into the 1990s.

A regeneration scheme was announced in 2004; supported by the Phoenix Trust, the maltings would be converted into residential, retail and business space. Public consultation took place in 2005 and 2006, with around 90% of participants supporting regeneration and three-quarters asking for a cinema and entertainment complex. Lincolnshire Enterprise granted £200,000 towards the regeneration scheme and the Gladedale Group came forward to develop the project. Over the next three years, they worked with the Prince's Regeneration Trust to draw up plans for the site's regeneration which protected the historic exterior. In 2009, their proposals were submitted for planning permission. North Kesteven District Council approved the £50 million development in 2011; Tesco was also granted permission to build a £20 million supermarket as part of the redevelopment. The maltings would be converted into retail and office space, alongside 220 apartments.

However, in 2012, Sleaford Town Council refused to grant permission for a link road connecting Boston Road to the site because of "concerns about closing a level crossing and the loss of trees" at the Boston Road Recreation Ground. After a lengthy stalemate, the District Council served a compulsory purchase order on the site in 2014, but Tesco announced early the following year that it would no longer be investing in the maltings complex following a series of financial setbacks to the company. Although Gladedale (by then known as Avant Homes) announced its commitment to converting parts of the site to residential use, the leader of North Kesteven District Council, Marion Brighton, stated that the plans were "effectively on hold" following the withdrawal of Tesco.

The maltings were constructed to designs by Herbert A. Couchman, Bass & Co.'s chief engineer. Built in red brick with Welsh slate roofing, the complex follows a rectangular plan along an east-west orientation: a central four-storey water tower is flanked by four malthouses. Behind the tower is a tall, octagonal chimney. The malthouses are identical in design and layout; barley was fed into a granary section, before being moved onto the germination floors and eventually transported to one of the twin kilns, where malting took place. Their southern fronts consisted of a six-storey building of five bays with a gable spanning three windows that faces the other ranges. Projecting northwards is a ten-bay section of four-storeys which formed the germination floors.

With a frontage of nearly 1,000 ft and a total area of 50,000 sq ft, the maltings complex is believed to be largest of its type in England; the architectural historians Sir Nikolaus Pevsner and John Harris commented that "for sheer impressiveness little in English industrial architecture can equal the scale of this building. In 1974, it was recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building in recognition of its importance as an example of a large-scale industrial malting complex in which "considerations of form, massing, symmetry and scale have produced a design of high aesthetic quality combined with clear functional expression"; it also represents the importance of the English brewing industry in the late-19th and early 20th centuries and large-scale malting at its peak. Owing to its derelict state, the building was also placed on English Heritage's "Heritage at Risk" register in 2011.

There are five workers' cottages along the path from Mareham Lane to the industrial site; each are Grade II listed. The complex's offices, storage depot, weigh offices, cartsheds, gateways, walls and mess rooms are also listed at the same grade.

TouchTone

TouchTone is a 2015 puzzle video game for iOS devices by Mikengreg, a two-person indie game development team made up of Mike Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. The player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The player unlocks chains of emails by completing a series of puzzles wherein a beam is reflected around a room to a set destination. "TouchTone" core concept grew from a two-day game jam immediately following their 2012 release of "Gasketball", but only found its hacker theme following the mid-2013 Edward Snowden global surveillance disclosures. The tone of "TouchTone" story grew from satirical to serious over the course of the game's development.

The game was released on March 19, 2015. Review aggregator Metacritic characterized "TouchTone" reviews as generally favorable. Critics praised the game's visual style and story, but criticized the way the game did not allow players to skip puzzles. Reviewers found the light-bending puzzle premise unoriginal, but appreciated its thematic connection.

As part of a government surveillance program, the player monitors phone calls to find public threats. Apart from infrequent interaction with their handler, the player is left to solve puzzles in pursuit of one such lead. The puzzles are based on the "reflection puzzle" popularized by role-playing video games wherein the player moves mirrors to reflect a beam of light about a room. In "TouchTone", the player swipes the screen to move pieces that redirect incoming beams, symbolic of phone signals, into specific locations. The waveform beams are displayed in different solid colors and must be matched with the destination "node" of the same color by passing through moveable pieces that reflect and split the beam. The pieces do not move individually but as rows and columns in cardinal directions.

The levels are displayed in an overworld with a branching, tree structure. The player must pursue multiple branches to further the story. Optional, side-story branches do not advance the main plot but have the hardest puzzles. The story is told through chains of emails, which are unlocked by completing puzzles. The player assumes the role of an American Muslim National Security Agency agent who determines whether the hacked emails are pertinent to national security. The ethics of government surveillance are a core theme of the game.

Mikengreg, an indie game developer duo of Mike Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend, released the 2010 "Solipskier" and 2012 "Gasketball" together before "TouchTone" in 2015. After "Gasketball" release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend planned a celebratory road trip to a game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. "Gasketball" turned out to be a "financial flop", and so Boxleiter wanted to use the jam to create "something new, ... something really small and perfect". By the end of the two-day jam, the core mirror reflection mechanics of "TouchTone" were in place, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize the remainder of the game. During this time, the two also worked separately, and Wohlwend released the well-received "Threes" with Asher Vollmer in 2014. Wohlwend tried to fit audio signal elements into "TouchTone" nascent theme of light, lasers, and prisms. They felt this direction was unsuccessful, like a "boring Flash game", and that the game too closely mimicked "a hacking minigame from a bigger AAA game like "BioShock" or "System Shock"".

"TouchTone" found its theme following the Edward Snowden global surveillance disclosures in mid 2013, as Mikengreg felt they could provide satirical commentary through the "hacking" element of the game. The story shed its jocular tone as it and its political content grew deeper and more serious. Boxleiter wrote most of the script, which totaled over 20,000 words in length. It was his first effort at professional writing, and it took him five months. He and Wohlwend would conference after each chapter for coherency. Boxleiter wanted the story to explore the "questions ... floating around the national consciousness" rather than be "heavy-handed" and prescriptive. Despite this work, Boxleiter felt that the story and the gameplay "don't necessarily interact with each other", with the story serving to drive those less interested in puzzles through the rest of the game. They playtested the game in public at the theater in Logan Square, Chicago, though they acknowledged difficulty in playtesting the story's private experience. Mikengreg decided against including an option to skip puzzles, which they felt would spoil the game and the player's capacity to adapt to increasing difficulty. They attribute this game design philosophy to Derek Yu of "Spelunky".

"TouchTone" was released as an iOS universal app for both iPhone and iPad on March 19, 2015. It received a front page feature on the iOS App Store upon its release.

"TouchTone" received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It received "Pocket Gamer" silver award.

Reviewers praised the game's aesthetics and criticized its unoriginal puzzle concept. "TouchArcade" Shaun Musgrave wrote that the game's "striking" visuals and "politically charged" message were not completely reconciled but were "individually strong". He described its art style as similar to Wohlwend's previous work and its political statement as indicative of Mikengreg's strong opinions. Musgrave praised the game's writing but thought the actual puzzles were weaker. "148Apps" Jordan Minor found the "clinical, minimally-colored cyberspace" and 1970s thriller film aesthetic "chillingly appropriate" for the theme's tension. He also chided the puzzles for not being "a reward unto themselves" and the gameplay's "monotony" for being similar to that of "Papers, Please" without serving the same dehumanizing point. Minor called "TouchTone" "essentially a series of the hacking minigames ... [from] "BioShock", "Deus Ex", or "Watch Dogs"." "Pocket Gamer" Craig Grannell appreciate how the game "often forces a kind of upside-down thinking" and compared its message to that of "Blackbar". "Gamezebo" Jim Squires said that "TouchTone" is "perfectly designed for a certain set of mobile gamers" and compared its gameplay to the 1987 "Deflektor". Despite the game's similarity to "countless light-bending puzzle games", he found Mikengreg's implementation "fiendishly clever" in the way the player moves rows of tiles rather than one at a time.

Reviewers did not like the inability to skip puzzles. Musgrave wrote that moments of being "stuck on a mandatory stage" detracted from the player's investment and sense of immersion in the story. Grannell of "Pocket Gamer" wrote that "TouchTone" linearity was its "only downside", though he also wished for options to "undo" mid-game choices and to save puzzle progress upon leaving the game. Multiple reviewers appreciated the game's story. "Wired" Kyle Vanhemert felt that the act of determining whether messages were pertinent to national security was a "powerful experience". Squires of "Gamezebo" considered the story one of the game's strong points, and unusually so for a puzzle game. He wrote that there was sufficient "intrigue" to want to finish the story, and that the reward of more story encouraged him to get through the harder puzzles.

Hurricane Blanca (2015)

Hurricane Blanca was the earliest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in Baja California in any given year. Forming as a tropical depression on May 31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June 1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June 2–3, becoming a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145 mph (230 km/h) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting in a period of weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category 4 status on June 6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June 7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June 8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day.

Although Blanca remained far from Jalisco, large swells and rip currents produced by the hurricane claimed four lives. In Northwestern Mexico, watches and warnings were raised prior to the storm's landfall. Blanca caused generally light damage in the region, consisting of downed trees and power lines. Remnant moisture from the system spread across the Southwestern United States, resulting in several days of scattered thunderstorms. Flash flooding occurred in multiple states, washing out roads and damaging homes, though the overall effects were limited.

On May 26, 2015, a tropical wave traversed Central America and entered the Eastern Pacific. Little development occurred over the following few days as the system drifted westward. Convective activity finally blossomed on May 30 and following the consolidation of a surface low, it was classified as a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on May 31. At this time, the depression was situated 370 mi (595 km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. The system initially drifted northwest along the edge of a weak ridge; however, steering currents soon collapsed and left the depression to meander in the same general region for four days. Strong wind shear stemming from the nearby Hurricane Andres precluded intensification of the nascent depression. Other factors, including a moist atmosphere and sea surface temperatures of presented favorable conditions for development once the shear relaxed. Formation of a central dense overcast on June 1 marked the transition into a tropical storm, at which time the system was assigned the name "Blanca". As shear steadily relaxed, conditions became exceptionally favorable for rapid intensification. Accordingly, the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme showed a 90 percent chance of winds increasing by 45 mph (75 km/h) in 24 hours, among the highest probabilities seen by National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecaster Michael Brennan.
The upper-level environment became even more favorable during the overnight of June 1–2 as anticyclonic outflow developed above Blanca, providing necessary ventilation for intensification. Turning south along an erratic, drifting course, an eye feature developed within the storm's convective mass on June 2. Blanca reached hurricane strength by 18:00 UTC and underwent rapid intensification thereafter. A small, pinhole eye soon appeared on visible and infrared satellite imagery. Reaching major hurricane intensity by 12:00 UTC on June 3, Blanca marked the earliest occurrence of a season's second such storm on record. The system featured a small, well-defined eye surrounded by intense convection. Hours later, at 18:00 UTC, the hurricane achieved its estimated peak strength as a Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 936 mbar (hPa; 27.64 inHg). Given continued favorable conditions, forecasters at the NHC predicted Blanca to achieve Category 5 status—the highest ranking on the scale, indicating winds in excess of .

Contrary to forecasts, the still quasi-stationary Blanca soon degraded. The hurricane's persistence over the same location for several days resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler waters, with temperatures underneath the storm falling from . Compounding the effects of cooler water was an eyewall replacement cycle. This resulted in rapid weakening, with Blanca's winds falling to 90 mph (150 km/h) by 12:00 UTC on June 5. The previously small core of Blanca dramatically expanded to 65 mi (100 km) across, with convection asymmetrically wrapping around it. During this period, a mid-level ridge north of the hurricane moved east and allowed Blanca to acquire a steady northwest track. Re-intensification ensued on June 6 as the hurricane moved away from its cold wake and traversed an area of warmer water.

Throughout June 6, Blanca's convective structure became more symmetric as it completed its eyewall replacement cycle. Aided by impressive outflow, the hurricane regained Category 4 status by 12:00 UTC, marking its secondary peak intensity with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). Soon thereafter, Blanca moved back over cooler waters and began weakening. A turn to the north-northwest also occurred at this time as it rounded a mid-level ridge over Mexico. The hurricane passed roughly 30 mi (45 km) northeast of Socorro Island on June 7. An automated weather station there recorded sustained winds of , with a peak gust of , before it ceased reporting. Additionally, a pressure of 977.3 mbar (hPa; 28.86 inHg) was observed. Deep convection steadily weakened and the hurricane's eye filled as the winds decreased.

Increasing wind shear accelerated the rate of weakening, causing Blanca's mid- and low-level circulation centers to decouple. By 18:00 UTC on June 7, the hurricane degraded to a tropical storm. Around 10:30 UTC on June 8, Blanca made landfall over Isla Santa Margarita off the coast of Baja California Sur before striking the mainland, near Puerto Argudin, at 11:15 UTC. This marked the earliest known landfall in the state, and peninsula, on record during a calendar year. It surpassed the previous earliest—Tropical Storm Calvin on July 8, 1993—by a month. Turning back to the northwest, the system briefly emerged back over the Pacific Ocean before weakening to a tropical depression. Blanca made its third and final landfall near El Patrocinio around 20:30 UTC. With deep convection no longer present, the depression degraded into a remnant low early on June 9 over the central Baja California peninsula before dissipating hours later.

On June 3, precautionary alerts were raised across the southern Baja California Peninsula and much of Western Mexico, due to potential impacts from the hurricane. Two days later, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for parts of Baja California Sur before upgrading it to a warning on June 6. Warnings ultimately extended northward to Punta Abreojos. A hurricane watch was temporarily in place; however, Blanca's abrupt weakening on June 7 prompted its discontinuation. All schools were closed in Baja California Sur on June 8. A collective 3,300 troops from the Mexican Army and Navy were deployed to Baja California Sur to ensure the safety of residents. Under the threat of waves, the port of Los Cabos suspended operations. Within Sonora, all schools in the Empalme, Guaymas, and Hermosillo municipalities were canceled for June 8.

Waves up to damaged coastal installations in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. A surfer was pulled out by rip currents near Villa Obregón and required rescue; however, the rescuer was also overcome and both drowned. Two fishermen ignored warnings to remain at port and died amid rough seas from the hurricane. Striking Baja California Sur on June 8, Blanca brought tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain to the region. The highest sustained winds were observed at Cabo San Lucas International Airport, reaching while gusts were measured at in San Juanico. Across the state, high winds downed power lines and left 104,106 residents without electricity. However, around 90 percent of the outages were fixed within 12 hours of the storm. The winds also broke a few windows. Sinaloa experienced similar effects, with strong winds downing many trees and tearing apart billboards, primarily in Los Mochis and Guasave.

The remnants of Blanca, aided by an unusually late-season coastal low, later brought several days of scattered thunderstorms to the Southwestern United States. Effects in California were primarily concentrated across the Mojave Desert and southern Great Basin. Daily rainfall records were broken in several areas, though accumulations were generally less than . Maricopa and Taft received of rain in 30 minutes, triggering flash flooding that stranded vehicles and prompted the temporary closure of State Route 166. Flooding and mud flows covered parts of State Route 190 in Inyo County, resulting in an accident that injured two people. Thunderstorm winds downed several trees, two of which fell on mobile homes. Hail up to in diameter was observed in Ford City. Some flooding took place in Santa Barbara County. Damage across the state amounted to $68,000.

Record rainfall was observed in parts of Arizona, with Yuma recording measurable precipitation for only the seventeenth time in June since records began in 1876. Rainfall amounted to in the city, and fell in Tucson. In Six Mile Canyon in Nevada, near the border of Lyon and Storey counties, of rain fell in an hour, resulting in flash flooding. Damage was primarily to landscaping with minor effects to homes. The normally dry Pine Nut Creek in Dresslerville rose in a short period of time, inundating nine homes and covering low water crossings. Multiple roads across Esmeralda, Eureka, and Lander counties were subjected to flooding. Damage across Nevada was $46,000.

Following above-average rainfall since April, renewed precipitation in New Mexico led to flash flooding. Roads were washed away near Conchas Dam and minor flooding took place near Pojoaque. A strong thunderstorm over the Navajo Nation in New Mexico spawned a brief EF0 tornado near Napi Headquarters. Hail up to in diameter was observed and rainfall caused the Animas River to overflow. Damage in the state reached $20,000. Flash flooding also took place in Utah, including along the Paria River; a stream gauge observed a peak flow of 1,160 ft (32.8 m) per second. A peak wind gust of was observed on Flattop Mountain in Emery County.

Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake

Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake, also known as Self-Portrait, is an 1889 oil on wood painting by French artist Paul Gauguin, which represents his late Brittany period in the fishing village of Le Pouldu in northwestern France. No longer comfortable with Pont-Aven, Gauguin moved on to Le Pouldu with his friend and student Meijer de Haan and a small group of artists. He stayed for several months in the autumn of 1889 and the summer of 1890, where the group spent their time decorating the interior of Marie Henry's inn with every major type of art work. Gauguin painted his "Self-Portrait" in the dining room with its companion piece, "Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan" (1889).

The painting shows Gauguin against a red background with a halo above his head and apples hanging beside him as he holds a snake in his hand while plants or flowers appear in the foreground. The religious symbolism and the stylistic influence of Japanese wood-block prints and cloisonnism are apparent. The portrait was completed several years before Gauguin visited Tahiti and is one of more than 40 self-portraits he completed during his lifetime. The work reached the art market in 1919 when Marie Henry sold it at the Galerie Barbazanges in Paris as part of her collected works from the Le Pouldu period. American banker Chester Dale acquired the painting in 1928, gifting it upon his death in 1962 to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) was a French Post-Impressionist artist and figure in the Symbolist movement known for his contributions to the Synthetist style. In 1886, he spent the summer in Pont-Aven in Brittany, an artists colony that became known as the Pont-Aven School for Gauguin's influence and the work they produced. In late 1888, Gauguin painted for nine weeks with Vincent van Gogh at his Yellow House in Arles in the south of France before van Gogh had a breakdown, leading him to cut off his ear and be hospitalized. Gauguin left Arles and never saw van Gogh again, but they continued to exchange letters and ideas. 

He briefly returned to Paris where he lived with painter Émile Schuffenecker, but returned to Pont-Aven in the spring of 1889 only to find it too crowded. Gauguin moved farther away "to escape the tourists and the Parisian and foreign painters" and arrived at Le Pouldu on October 2, 1889. He found lodgings with Meijer de Haan at Buvette de la Plage, an inn run by Marie Henry. De Haan introduced Gauguin to Thomas Carlyle's novel "Sartor Resartus" (1836) by way of conversation. Although he would not read the novel for several more years, Gauguin became acquainted with Carlyle's ideas which would influence his approach to art during this time.

The interior of Marie Henry's inn became their canvas, and they painted their work on the walls, ceilings, and windows. They were later joined by artists Paul Sérusier and Charles Filiger. According to Nora M. Heimann, when the room was completed, it "encompassed paintings of every major type—genre, landscape, self-portraiture, portraiture, still life, and even history painting—in media ranging from tempera and oil on plaster to oil on canvas and panel; as well as prints and drawings; painted and glazed ceramic vessels; exotic found objects; and carved, polychromed figures in wood."

Gauguin tried to win the affection of Marie Henry, the innkeeper, but she spurned his advances and became intimate with de Haan instead, leaving Gauguin jealous. Gauguin departed on November 7, 1890, leaving his work at Marie Henry's inn. She retired in 1893 and moved to Kerfany, taking many of the art works with her. She continued to lease the inn until 1911 when she sold it. When the new owner was redecorating the inn in 1924, which by then had been converted into a restaurant, the rest of the murals were discovered buried intact under wallpaper.

Van Gogh had previously decorated rooms with his paintings, in particular the rooms of several restaurants in Paris and the Yellow House in Arles. Gauguin and de Haan appear to have been influenced by this work, as they began decorating the dining room of Buvette de la Plage in a similar fashion. Gauguin's "Self-Portrait" was prepared along with its pendant, "Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan" (1889), to the right and left respectively of a fireplace on the upper panels of two wooden cupboard doors. Gauguin gave the panels a subtle, textured matte surface using white chalk ground and a combed wave pattern. Both works were completed sometime between mid-November and mid-December 1889.

French art historian Françoise Cachin notes that Gauguin designed both "Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake" and its companion piece "Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan" as a caricature. In his "Self-Portrat", Gauguin appears against a red background with a halo above his head and apples hanging beside him as he holds a snake in his hand with what appear to be either plants or flowers in the foreground. Curator Philip Conisbee observes the religious symbolism in the images, noting that the "apples and snake refer to the Garden of Eden, temptation, sin, and the Fall of Man." Gauguin divides the canvas in half, painting himself as both saint and sinner, reflecting his own personal myth as an artist. In the top portion of the painting, Gauguin is almost angelic with the halo, looking away from the apples of temptation. In the bottom portion, he holds the snake, completing the duality.
Jirat-Wasiutyński notes that art historian Denys Sutton was the first critic to interpret Gauguin's self-portrait as "demonic". This interpretation is illustrated by the pendant, the companion piece "Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan" (1889), which visually complements the "Self-Portrait". De Haan's devilish eyes and red hair shaped like horns in his portrait on the left side of the dining room where it was created "in situ", corresponds to the snake held in Gauguin's hand in his self-portrait on the right door of the dining room. Two books appear on the table in de Haan's portrait: "Paradise Lost" (1667–74) by seventeenth-century English poet John Milton, and "Sartor Resartus" by Thomas Carlyle. These respective literary allusions, to Milton's Satan and to Carlyle's Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, a character described as both angelic and diabolical, play directly into de Haan's and Gauguin's corresponding self-portraits. Jirat-Wasiutyński argues that Gauguin portrays himself as a magus, as "both seer and demonic angel".

The work shows the influence of Japanese wood-block prints and cloisonnism. In the painting, Gauguin wears what art historian Henri Dorra compares to the saffron colored robe of a Buddhist monk, perhaps influenced by Van Gogh's earlier "Self-Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin" (1888). In a letter to Gauguin dated October 3, 1888, Van Gogh describes himself in the self-portrait as "a character of a bonze, a simple worshiper of the eternal Buddha". Compared to Gauguin's more traditional "Self-Portrait Dedicated to Carrière" (1888 or 1889), the self-portrait painted at Le Pouldu is more "sinister".

In 1919, Marie Henry sold Gauguin's "Self-Portrait" as part of a batch of 14 other works to François Norgelet for a total of 35,000 francs, where it was exhibited at the Galerie Barbazanges in Paris. Although ownership details are scant, the painting is thought to have passed through the hands of several owners, including London art collector Mrs. R. A. Workman and later Lord Ivor Spencer-Churchill. It was sold by Churchill to the galleries Alex Reid and Lefèvre in 1923, who then sold it to Kraushaar Galleries in 1925. American banker Chester Dale acquired the work in 1928. The painting was later bequeathed by Dale to the National Gallery of Art in 1962 after his death. The Chester Dale Collection opened at the National Gallery in 1965.

Go, Stewie, Go!

"Go, Stewie, Go!" is the 13th episode of the eighth season of the animated comedy series "Family Guy". It originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 14, 2010. The episode features Stewie after he auditions, cross-dressed under the pseudonym Karina Smirnoff, for a female role in the American version of "Jolly Farm Revue", and eventually ends up falling in love with a female co-star on the show. Meanwhile, Lois finds herself attracted to Meg's surprisingly normal boyfriend, once Peter causes her to realize her advancing age.

The episode was written by Gary Janetti and directed by Greg Colton. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to receiving criticism from the Parents Television Council. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 6.72 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Stephen Bishop, Mo Collins, Colin Ford, Lucas Grabeel, Anne Hathaway, Nana Visitor and Mae Whitman, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. "Go, Stewie, Go!" was released on DVD along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.

Brian, walking in drunk, notices that Stewie has resumed watching "Jolly Farm Revue", after previously swearing off the show in "Road to Europe". Remembering a story he had seen in the local newspaper, Brian tells Stewie about upcoming auditions for an American version of the show. Jumping at the opportunity, the two show up to the auditions, but quickly learn that there is only one female role remaining. Determined to win a spot on the show, Stewie decides to cross-dress as a woman, naming his new identity "Karina Smirnoff". Beginning his audition, he starts by telling a completely fabricated story. Convincing the producers that he is telling a true tale, he wins the role. The next morning, on the first day of filming, Stewie as Karina introduces himself to the rest of the cast, and quickly falls in love with a female co-star named Julie. Another co-star, Randall, objects to the new role that Karina was cast to play, and takes Julie away from him to prevent their friendship. As they continue shooting, however, the two develop a friendly relationship, eventually deciding to hold a sleepover, where they become even closer. The next day, Julie professes her love for Karina by wishing that she was actually a boy, causing Stewie, as Karina, to come on to her. Julie insists that she is not a lesbian, so Stewie decides to unveil his true identity to the entire cast during a live taping of the show. Shocked that Karina was actually a boy, Julie's mother refuses to let her speak to him, with Stewie left to regret his decision to come out as a cross-dresser, and decides to go get ice cream with Brian, as he can no longer wear that dress.

Meanwhile, Peter begins to insult Lois about her advancing age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois becomes aware of her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out with him on the family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.

The episode was written by returning writer Gary Janetti, his first episode since the fourth season episode "". In addition, the episode was directed by series regular Greg Colton, before the conclusion of the seventh production season. The episode was Colton's second for the season, the first being the season premiere, "Road to the Multiverse", which received high praise from critics. The episode saw the third re-appearance, the first being an equally brief appearance in "Spies Reminiscent of Us" and the second in "Road to the Multiverse", by former main cast member Mike Henry as the voice of Cleveland Brown. The actor had previously left the role on "Family Guy", in order to star as the character in his own spin-off, entitled "The Cleveland Show".

"Go, Stewie, Go!", along with the eleven other episodes from "Family Guy"s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on December 13, 2011. The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating "And Then There Were Fewer", a mini-feature entitled "The Comical Adventures of "Family Guy" – Brian & Stewie: The Lost Phone Call", and footage of the "Family Guy" panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International.

In addition to the regular cast, musician Stephen Bishop rerecorded his single "It Might Be You", actress Mo Collins appeared as a little girl, voice actor Colin Ford appeared briefly as Randall, actress Anne Hathaway appeared as Mother Maggie, actor Lucas Grabeel appeared as Meg's new boyfriend Anthony, voice actress Nana Visitor appeared briefly as the audition caller and voice actress Mae Whitman appeared as Julie. Recurring guest voice actors Ralph Garman, writer Gary Janetti, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, actress Jennifer Tilly and writer John Viener also made minor appearances.

Although never specifically referenced or mentioned in the episode itself, Stewie's alter-ego is named after well-known ballroom dancer Karina Smirnoff, who had previously danced professionally on the American television reality show "Dancing with the Stars". Most of the storyline following Stewie is a homage of the 1982 film "Tootsie". The episode's title is also a reference to the song "Go, Tootsie, Go" played during the photo-shoot montage in the film. A similar scene featuring the song was slightly modified, replacing "Tootsie" with "Stewie," in the lyrics to the song. Another song from the film, "It Might Be You" by Stephen Bishop, is played during the closing credit sequence.

As Stewie and Brian watch a recorded episode of "Jolly Farm Revue", Stewie notes the introduction of several new characters to the show. The television screen is then shown, as Karina reveals the characters to his co-star, Julie. The new characters include parodies of the "Sesame Street" characters Big Bird, who describes himself as a "big bird," and a self-described "grouch" named "Moody Green Garbage Creature", who resembles Oscar the Grouch, and butch and femme versions of Bert and Ernie, who try to protect Karina and Julie from Oscar.

After sending Meg out on an errand to pick up her grandfather, Lois continues to seduce Anthony, having been interested in him since Peter had begun insulting her about her advancing age. Quickly returning after forgetting the car keys, Meg discovers her mother making out with her new boyfriend on the couch. The bass jingle used extensively in the long-running NBC sitcom "Seinfeld" is then heard, with the scene pausing, before transitioning to the "Jolly Farm" studio. In a surprise visit to the Griffin family home, Julie unexpectedly appears when Stewie opens the front door. Expecting Julie to recognize him, he forgets that he is not dressed as Karina, causing him to hurriedly change clothing, while pretending to have an argument with his fabricated persona. A similar scene is featured in the 1993 film "Mrs. Doubtfire", starring actor Robin Williams. Stewie and Jolly Farm make a reference to Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747–100 destroyed by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 occupants. Large portions of the plane fell onto Lockerbie, which killed 11 people, escalating the death toll to 270. A song features on Jolly Farm that explicitly describes debris from the newly disintegrated plane falling into Lockerbie, sung in the fashion of a nursery rhyme.

In an improvement over the previous two episodes, the episode was viewed in 6.72 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.5 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating "The Simpsons", as well as the series premiere of "Sons of Tucson", in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership.

Reviews of the episode were mixed, calling the storyline a " material in the long-running dysfunctional yet affectionate relationship between Brian and Stewie," while criticizing its multiple cultural references. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the episode a "pleasant surprise," enjoying Stewie's storyline, while criticizing the subplot between Lois and Meg. Ramsey Isler of IGN was much more critical of the episode, however, saying that "while there a couple of funny moments, there are more misses than hits," giving the episode a 6 out of 10. In a subsequent review of "Family Guy"s eighth season, Isler listed "Go, Stewie, Go!" as being "full of the lowest of the lowest-common-denominator "jokes", with heavy reliance on toilet humor and the characteristic cutaway gags that have steadily gotten more random and less funny." In contrast, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode, saying that it " an emotional glimpse into the characters."

Naming the episode as its "Worst TV Show of the Week" for "strong sexual content," the Parents Television Council called the episode a "nauseating new low," criticizing multiple scenes, including Lois making out with a minor, as well as the confrontation between Brian and Karina at the bar. The PTC also criticized Seth MacFarlane for attempting to "elicit disgust" throughout the episode by " incest and rape" in order to "provoke ."

The episode was heavily criticized by families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 for the nursery rhyme, "It's raining babies and luggage and limbs and Daddy doesn't come home", which explicitly describes the debris from the disintegrating plane falling into Lockerbie, sung in the fashion of that of a nursery rhyme.

Chausath Yogini Temple, Morena

The Chausath Yogini Temple, Morena, also known as Ekattarso Mahadeva Temple, is an 11th-century temple located in Morena district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is one of the few such Yogini temples in the country which is in a good condition. The temple is formed by a circular wall with 64 chambers and an open mandapa in the centre, separated by a courtyard which is circular in shape, where Shiva is deified. The temple has been declared an ancient historical monument by the Archaeological Survey of India.

The Chausath Yogini temple is in Mitaoli village (also spelled Mitawali or Mitavali), near Padaoli in Morena district from Gwalior. According to an inscription dated to 1323 CE (Vikram Samvat 1383), the temple was built by the Kachchhapaghata king Devapala (). It is said that the temple was the venue of providing education in astrology and mathematics based on the transit of the Sun.

The Archaeological Survey of India has declared the temple an ancient and historical monument under Act No. LXXI of 1951, dt.28/11/1951.

The temple is located on a hill which is about in height and there are 100 steps to climb leading to the entrance of the temple. It is externally circular in shape with a radius of and within its interior part it has 64 small chambers, each with a mandapa which is open and a facia of pilasters and pillars. The roof of the entire structure is flat including that of another east facing circular temple within the outer circular wall. A large passage or courtyard lies between the outer enclosure and the central temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. There is an open porch entrance to this temple. The exterior surface of the outer wall has carvings of Hindu deities. Each of the 64 chambers in the outer circle has an image of Shiva deified in it. However, recent investigations have confirmed that originally these had a Yogini image deified in them and hence the temple is known as Chausath Yogini Temple ('Chausath' here means "Sixty four" ). It is said that the roof over the 64 chambers and the central shrine had towers or shikharas which were probably removed during later modifications.

Within the main central shrine there are slab coverings which have perforations in them to drain rainwater to a large underground storage. The pipe lines from the roof lead the rain water to the storage are also visible. The temple needs conservation measures to preserve the ancient monument in good shape.

The design of the temple has withstood earthquake shocks, without any damage to its circular structural features, in the past several centuries. The temple is in the Seismic Zone III. This fact was cited when the issue of safety from earthquake effect of the Parliament House which is also a circular structure, similar to the Chausath Yogini Temple, was debated in the Indian Parliament.

Noting some of its architectural similarities, it is often stated that Delhi's Parliament House which was built in the 1920s has been patterned on the lines of this circular-shaped temple. There is, however, no reliable basis for this.

1980 Eureka earthquake

The 1980 Eureka earthquake (also known as the Gorda Basin earthquake) occurred on November 8 at along the northern coastal area of California in the United States. With a moment magnitude of 7.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII ("Very strong"), this strike-slip earthquake was the largest to occur in California in 28 years. Although damage was considered light, several loss estimates equaled or exceeded $2 million, and six injuries resulted when two vehicles came down with the partial collapse of a highway overpass on US 101 in Fields Landing. The north coast of California experiences frequent plate boundary earthquakes near the Mendocino Triple Junction and intraplate events also occur within the Gorda Plate.

Due to the regional seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, but the majority of records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance. Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak ground acceleration could be made.

Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction is an area of active seismicity where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.

The left-lateral strike-slip earthquake was the largest to occur in California since the 1952 Kern County earthquake. The mainshock (which was described as a multiple-rupture, with four subevents in the initial 80 seconds) and its aftershocks occurred on a northeast-trending fault that extended from near the Mendocino Fault to a point northwest of Eureka. Movement along the fault is due to a north-south compressional regime and the resulting intraplate deformation of the Gorda Plate. Previous events in this area were the January 1922 7.3 and the January 1923 7.2 shocks.

The earthquake occurred offshore (to the northwest of Eureka, about west of Patrick's Point) and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII ("Very strong"). Some people reported intense shaking that lasted for 15 to 30 seconds. In the epicentral area, items were knocked off shelves and furniture was displaced, but damage was considered light (the smaller 5.2 event that occurred in June 1975 caused more damage).

While most of the damage from the Gorda Basin earthquake was considered light, there were some exceptions. In Eureka, effects included broken windows and dishes, fallen chimneys, and merchandise that fell from store shelves. In Fields Landing, King Salmon, Loleta, and Big Lagoon areas, the strongest effects included surface cracks on the ground, soil liquefaction, small landslides and rockfalls, and numerous slumps along the Eel River. Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone, where the roadway was reduced to one lane of travel in some areas. Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing. Seismic wave amplification, poor design, or inadequate construction style may have contributed to losses there.

The Tompkins Hill Road overpass is situated just south of Fields Landing and was built in the late 1960s. It suffered slight damage during the 1975 earthquake and was due for a retrofit in 1981. The overpass was constructed with cement abutments on earthen ramps on either end and a series of concrete support columns in the middle. Eight reinforced concrete spans accommodated northbound and southbound lanes of traffic, with no anchors connecting the spans with each other or to the abutments. At the time of the shock, two of the southbound spans came off their support (a ledge) and six people were injured when a Volkswagen Beetle and a small pickup truck plummeted off the bridge.

The Humboldt Bay Power Plant is located about north of the collapsed highway overpass and operated fossil-fuel and nuclear units in the 1960s and 1970s. The nuclear unit was cancelled in 1976 because of seismic safety concerns, but the two fossil-fuel units remained in operation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission performed a post-event survey of the facility's systems in late 1980, but inspectors found only minor effects to the plant's structure, piping, tanks, and other mechanical equipment. It was found that the two units were automatically shut down at the time of the shock for various protective concerns and that there were minor cracks in masonry and concrete, sheared bolts, pipe leaks, and slight movement of water tanks. The deformation of a reinforced masonry wall that resulted in a variable-width gap was the only structural issue.

With an area of perceptibility of more than 97,000 mi, it was felt from the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley to western Nevada, and as far as Salem in northern Oregon. Intensity VI ("Strong") effects were limited to a narrow coastal zone that included Myers Flat in the south and Brookings, Oregon in the north. Damage at this intensity level included broken plate glass windows, cracked walls, foundation and chimney damage, and significant loss of merchandise. In Fields Landing, two homes that came off their foundations, the fallen overpass, and broken gas, water, and sewer lines were associated with intensity VII ("Very strong") shaking.

Pacific Gas and Electric initially reported that peak ground accelerations in the range of .16–.4"g" were recorded on the floor of the refueling building on the plant's strong motion instruments (accelerometers). Low voltage from a faulty power supply left the instruments in a condition that was functional, but the records were not considered reliable. Three TERA Technology film recorders were also in use as a backup system, but these instruments also did not produce any usable records, because lack of maintenance had allowed dirt and grit to get inside. Only records from one instrument (an Engdhal peak shock recorder) was believed to be operating correctly, and with a close examination of the energy dispersed at various frequencies, an estimate of .15–.25"g" was given for the event at that location.

Rebecca Anderson

Rebecca Anderson (born May 1991) is an American beauty pageant titleholder from Oregon City, Oregon. She won a series of local titles beginning in 2011 and was crowned Miss Oregon 2014.

Entering her first pageant at age 19, Anderson competed successfully in local pageants until, on her fourth attempt, she won the state title in June 2014. She made appearances across the state and represented Oregon at Miss America 2015 in September 2014 but was not a finalist for the national crown. After completing her year as Miss Oregon, Anderson resumed her academic pursuits.

Anderson is a native of Oregon City, Oregon, and a 2009 graduate of Oregon City High School. While at OCHS, she participated in the drama program for four years and was a member of the school's dance team for two years. Her father is Ted Anderson, a wholesale nursery operator and licensed tax consultant. , mother Shari Anderson is the elected County Treasurer of Clackamas County, Oregon, an office she has held since 1999. Anderson has one younger sister, Malea, who is also an occasional pageant competitor.

Anderson is a 2013 graduate of Portland State University where she earned a bachelor's degree in environmental science. In 2014, in addition to her Miss Oregon duties, Anderson worked part-time as a "cute" clown for an event company. In August 2015, Anderson moved to North Dakota to begin pursuing a bachelor's degree in atmospheric science at the University of North Dakota.

Anderson began entering pageants at age 19, waiting until she felt was "responsible enough" to hold a pageant title. In early 2011, Anderson won the Miss Cascade 2011 title. She competed in the 2011 Miss Oregon pageant with the platform "Environmental Sustainability: Education for a Greener World" and a vocal performance of "Feeling Good" from the musical "The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd" in the talent portion of the competition. She finished in the top ten but was not a Top-5 finalist for the state title.

In early 2012, Anderson won the Miss Columbia Gorge 2012 title. She competed in the 2012 Miss Oregon pageant with the platform "Environmental Education" and a vocal performance in the talent portion of the competition. She finished in the top ten but was not a Top-5 finalist for the state crown.

In March 2013, Anderson won the Miss Portland 2013 title. She qualified for the 2013 Miss Oregon pageant as one of 22 entrants, including her younger sister Malea, competing as Miss Clackamas 2013. Rebecca Anderson competed with a platform of "American Red Cross: Red for Life" and a vocal performance of "Astonishing" from the musical "Little Women" in the talent portion of the competition. She was named third runner-up to winner Allison Cook.

On April 26, 2014, Anderson was crowned Miss Cascade 2014. She entered the Miss Oregon pageant in June 2014 as one of 23 qualifiers for the state title. Anderson's competition talent was a vocal performance of "Let it Go" from the Disney movie "Frozen". Her platform was "American Red Cross: Red for Life". Her on-stage interview question asked whether discrimination was a factor in the gender pay gap in the United States. Anderson agreed but countered that "women need to be more assertive" and strive to close the gap themselves rather than wait for a government-mandated solution.
Anderson won the competition on Saturday, June 28, 2014, when she received her crown from outgoing Miss Oregon titleholder Allison Cook. She earned more than $10,000 in scholarship money and other prizes from the state pageant.

As Miss Oregon, Anderson's activities included public appearances across the state of Oregon. Notable appearances included participating in local pageants, welcoming Air National Guard members home to Oregon, and serving as a judge for the Just For Men World Beard and Moustache Championships. Anderson's reign as Miss Oregon continued until June 27, 2015, when she crowned her successor, Ali Wallace, Miss Oregon 2015.

Anderson was Oregon's representative at the Miss America 2015 pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in September 2014. During the pageant's "Show Us Your Shoes" parade, Anderson wore a bicycle helmet and her shoes had tiny bicycles on top of the laces to tout Portland, Oregon, as a "bike-friendly" city. She was not a Top-16 semi-finalist for the national crown.

York Community Stadium

York Community Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium currently under construction in Huntington, York, England. It will be owned by City of York Council, and be shared by York City Football Club and York City Knights Rugby League Football Club. The projected capacity of the all-seater stadium is 8,005.

The move to a new stadium was necessitated by the terms of the loan York City secured from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund to purchase their Bootham Crescent ground. Planning permission for the current design, put forward by Greenwich Leisure, was granted in March 2015. After several delays, construction began in December 2017, for completion in mid-2019. In addition to the stadium, the site will house a leisure complex and a community hub.

York City F.C. ceased ownership of their Bootham Crescent ground in the summer of 1999, after the club's real property assets were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings. The club secured a £2 million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) to buy the ground in February 2004. The terms of this loan required the club to identify a site for a new stadium by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. Once plans for a new stadium were in place, the loan would turn into a grant to assist in funding the relocation.

As part of the loan agreement, Persimmon have first refusal on purchasing Bootham Crescent once York City leave, for 10% lower than its market value. Persimmon still intend to build 93 homes on the site, and the proceeds of the sale would go towards building the new stadium. In March 2008, York City's managing director Jason McGill cited "the annual cost of £60,000 for the maintenance and upkeep of a 1932 stadium with few commercial and income-generating opportunities" as the reason for the continued need to move to a new stadium.

York City had identified a preferred site for a new stadium by April 2007, but were unable to disclose the location due to confidentiality clauses. Despite the club failing to formally identify a site by the end of 2007, financial penalties were not incurred, as the FSIF were satisfied with the progress made. However, McGill said plans with the preferred site had stalled by March 2008. City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium in May 2008, which would be used by York City and the city's rugby league club, York City Knights.

A project board was established in January 2009, with the objective of ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved the outline business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of "The Press" noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.

Developers Oakgate (Monks Cross) Ltd submitted a planning application for a community stadium, for use by York City and York City Knights, and a retail park in September 2011. The council granted planning permission for the development in May 2012, with the stadium expected to be ready during the 2014–15 season. Gavin Aitchison of "The Press" commented that "one of York's biggest planning controversies in years finally came to a head" after the planning committee meeting that lasted over eight hours. Critics argued the development would damage the city centre economy, with a report by Deloitte saying the development would cost the city centre £50 million a year. In November 2012, construction was delayed until June 2014, for a completion date of July 2015. A delay to the construction of the shopping park in June 2013, caused by the discovery of protected great crested newts at the site, meant the stadium completion date was moved to January 2016.

In August 2014, Greenwich Leisure (GLL) were named as the council's preferred bidder to deliver an 8,000 all-seater stadium, to be shared by York City and York City Knights, and a leisure complex and a community hub. Construction was due to start during spring 2015, for a completion date of July 2016. York City were given responsibility for operating and managing the stadium on an initial 13-year contract. A planning application for the GLL plan was submitted to the council in December 2014, which was passed in March 2015. The cost of the stadium and leisure complex, including a replacement athletics track at another site, stood at £37 million.

In July 2015, construction was delayed as contracts were still being finalised, and the completion date was moved to during the 2016–17 season. Construction was delayed again a month later, with work to begin in February or March 2016, for completion in April or May 2017. With construction costs increasing due to more detailed design work, construction inflation and delays, the council pledged an additional £7.2 million in March 2016, raising the total cost of the project to £44.2 million. Construction was delayed to the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018.

A judicial review of the development was launched in October 2016 by Vue Cinemas, who objected to an extra screen being approved at the site. Later that year, principal contractor ISG withdrew, citing rising costs and the judicial review, which was settled in the City of York's favour in January 2017. By May that year, construction had not yet began nor had a new contractor been found. In November, the council stated that work would begin on the stadium before the end of the year, to be opened for the 2019–20 season. Construction began on 4 December 2017.

The stadium will host both women semi-finals of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.

The stadium is projected to have an all-seated capacity of 8,005. It will comprise four stands; the East Stand (Main Stand), the West Stand, the North Stand and the South Stand. The three-floored East Stand is to accommodate hospitality guests, players, officials and the media, and will be connected to the adjacent retail and community facilities. The stands will stretch the length of the playing field, and each corner will host stadium facilities, including matchday emergency services, stewarding, groundsman accommodation, plant space and a fan zone. The seats will be coloured red, white and blue, a combination of the colours of both teams.

The pitch will use reinforced natural grass, with provision to counter frost. The dimensions for football matches will be , with 3-metre-wide run-offs on the sides and 6.5- metre-wide run-offs behind the goals, which will meet FIFA recommendations. The dimensions for rugby league matches will be , with 6-metre in-goal areas, and 3-metre-wide run-offs on the sides and after the dead ball lines.

Adjoining the stadium will be the leisure complex, which will include a 25-metre, six-lane swimming pool, a sports hall for netball, badminton and basketball, a gym with dance and spinning studios, an adventure sports zone and three 3G five-a-side pitches. A community hub will house health and well-being services for York residents and visitors, including clinical services, an independent living assessment centre and a library.

Regular bus services will serve the stadium from the city centre, and additional services to other areas will be considered if there is sufficient demand. A review of the park and ride operating times will take place, with an extension to the service to be sought. On matchdays, 400 car parking places and 355 cycle parking places will be available at the stadium. A cycle route exists between the site and the city centre.

Isaac Folorunso Adewole

Isaac Folorunso Adewole (born 5 May 1954) is a Nigerian professor of gynaecology and obstetrics. Since November 2015 he has been the Minister of Health in the Cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari. He is a former vice-chancellor of the University of Ibadan and president of the African Organisation for Research and Training in Cancer. Prior to his appointment as the 11th substantive vice-chancellor of the university, he served as provost at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, the largest and oldest medical school in Nigeria. His research interest is in the area of human papillomavirus, HIV, and gynaecologic oncology, a specialised field of medicine that focuses on cancers of the female reproductive system, including ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, vaginal cancer, cervical cancer, and vulvar cancer. Adewole is a member of the governing council of Adeleke University and chairs the National Panel on Cervical Cancer Control Policy.
He is the only Nigerian professor appointed as member of the Council of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. He was appointed to serve as a member of the international advisory board of the African Cancer Institute, a comprehensive cancer centre in sub-Saharan black Africa.

In 2014, he celebrated his 60th birthday. In a public lecture held at the International Conference Centre of the University of Ibadan it was recalled how traducers tried relentlessly to sabotage his appointment as the vice-chancellor of the institution in 2010. The chairman of the 60th birthday celebration was Wole Olanipekun, a legal luminary, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, former president of the Nigerian Bar Association, and a past Pro-Chancellor of the university. He described Adewole as a "cat not only with nine lives, but one with 18 lives, who surmounted all the travails and conspiratorial petitions hatched against him by his traducers." In 2012, he was elected as a Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Science, the apex academic organisation in Nigeria. He was inducted into the academy along with Professor Mojeed Olayide Abass, a Nigerian professor of computer science at the University of Lagos, and Professor Akinyinka Omigbodun, the president of the West African College of Surgeons and former provost of the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan.

In 2014, he was appointed as a member of Adeleke University's governing council and in June 2015 he was appointed as a member of Pan-African University's governing council. Pan-African University is a post-graduate training and research network of university nodes in five regions, supported by the African Union. On 28 March 2015, he was appointed as Independent National Electoral Commission's Collation Officer in Lagos State for the Nigerian general election, 2015 and on 11 April, he served as returning officer for the Lagos State gubernatorial election. On 11 November 2015 he was appointed Minister for Health of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Adewole was born on 5 May 1954 at Ilesa, a city in Osun State in southwestern Nigeria. His parents are traders and his choice of career was informed by his father, who was an agent of United Africa Company, a British company which principally traded in West Africa during the 20th century.

His initial plan was to choose a career in aeronautics, particularly aerospace engineering, though his school guidance counselor suggested subjects which were useful for a career in medicine. In 1960, he attended Ogudu Methodist Primary School, Ilesa, where he spent one year, and Methodist School, Oke Ado in Ibadan, where he also spent one year before he completed his primary education at St Mathias Demonstration School Akure. He later attended Ilesa Grammar School, where he obtained a Grade I certificate with distinction in 1970 and Higher School Certificate (HSC) in 1972. In October 1973, he enrolled at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan; there he obtained an MBBS degree and in 1978 won the Glaxo Allenbury prize for outstanding performance in paediatrics.

In 1978, the same year he graduated from the University of Ibadan, he joined the University College Hospital, Ibadan. In 1979, he left the hospital for Sokoto for a compulsory year of service in the National Youth Service Corps. On completion of his service, he worked for a year as a medical officer at Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Ibadan, before returning to the college hospital as a senior house officer of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology. He held the position for one year before he was appointed registrar in 1982. In 1985, he left Nigeria for a research fellowship in the department of medical oncology at Charing Cross Hospital in London. Following completion of the fellowship programme, he returned to Nigeria to join the Royal Crown Specialist Hospital, Ibadan, where he spent four years before returning to the University College Hospital as Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.

He began his academic career as lecturer grade I at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, where he became a senior lecturer in 1992. On 1 October 1997, he was appointed a professor of medicine at the University of Ibadan, the same year he was appointed as a member of the University Senate. In 1999, he was appointed as acting head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology. He served in that capacity for one year. On 1 August 2000, he was appointed as the Dean, Faculty of Clinical Sciences and Dentistry, a position he held until 31 July 2002. On 1 August 2002 he was appointed as Provost, college of medicine and was succeeded by Professor Akinyinka Omigbodun. While serving in this capacity, he was member of the committee of provost and deans as well as chairman, university campus committee on AIDS. He also served as Chairman of the committee on evaluation of academic staff in 2004. On 1 May 2010, he became an adjunct professor at Northwestern University in Chicago. In December 2010, he was appointed as the 11th substantive vice-chancellor of the University of Ibadan, succeeding Olufemi Bamiro, a mechanical engineering professor and member of the Nigerian Academy of Engineering.

Between 1989 and 1992, he was an editorial adviser to the "Nigerian Medical Journal" and in 1997, he became a member of editorial board of the "Nigerian Journal of Medicine". He is currently serving as a member of oncology clinical reviews. He is also a member of the editorial board of "The Global Santé Journal". He has published over 180 scholarly articles and tens of books and has contributed to hundreds of other books as well.

Adewole is a health advocator. He is a coordinator of the Campaign Against Unwanted Pregnancy, a multidisciplinary not-for-profit organisation consisting of medical practitioners, social scientists, nurses, and teachers. He organized a free cervical cancer screening campaign and was part of the team that introduced sexual rights into the curriculum of medical schools in Nigeria. He is involved in Nigerian medical politics. He was influenced by Dr. Kayode Obembe, the former President of the Nigerian Medical Association, who encouraged him in the early 1980s to contest the seat of secretary to the Resident Doctors Association. In 1982, Adewole was elected as the Secretary-general of the University of Ibadan Chapter of the Association of Resident Doctors. He served in that capacity for one year. In 1984 he was elected president of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria and led a nationwide strike that resulted in his dismissal by the then military head of state, General Muhammadu Buhari, who is currently the President of Nigeria. When Buhari declared him a wanted man, Adewole went into exile. He worked at the Cancer Campaign Research Institute in London, where he authored four papers. He later returned to Nigeria and was elected deputy Secretary-general of the Nigerian Medical Association in 1988. In 1990 he was elected Secretary-general of the Nigerian Medical Association. He held the position for two years, and in 1993, he was elected chairman of the Oyo State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association. In March 1992 he was elected assistant secretary-general of the Confederation of African Medical Associations and Societies, and after his tenure ended in August 1997 he was elected secretary of the African regional task force on the control of gynaecological cancers.

In addition to his outstanding contributions to medicine and academics, he is also a pundit. In his welcome address at a public lecture organised by the Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa held at the International Conference Centre, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, he lamented the decline of Africa's contribution to global scientific output. He advocated for the commensurate expansion in doctoral training to meet the human resources needs of the new institutions as well as the existing ones.

In 2014, during the Ebola virus outbreak in Nigeria, he led a panel of experts to brainstorm on the latest scientific information on the nature of the virus, its signs, symptoms, and prevention. At a meeting held at the University of Ibadan to mobilise against the virus, he said "Nigeria is still safe, though we suffered a biological attack when Mr. Patrick Sawyer came into Nigeria from Liberia". He called on security agencies to investigate the bank accounts of Patrick Sawyer, who imported the virus into the country, to discover if he was paid to terrorise the country with the virus.

While receiving an award of excellence for outstanding contributions to obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Sunderland 2015 convocation ceremonies, he said any war against terror must be fought through collective efforts to nip it in the bud. An African proverb says 'Until you unmask it, a masquerade remains a terror'. A war against terror – of any kind – is best achieved through collective efforts. Our modest contributions from our corner of the globe have helped in restoring hope to millions of people without hope. It has become a lamp among the armament that unmasked the monster HIV, and we shall continue to beam the light of research on all threats to human existence. As part of efforts to end insurgency in Nigeria, the Ambassador of France to Nigeria Jacques Champagne de Labriolle visited Adewole in his office at the University of Ibadan. Adewole described the ambassador's visit as "auspicious and timely in the history of Nigeria." He said "our country must gladly engage the French-speaking countries, if we really want to maintain security for the citizenry. I believe that creating a long-term security should be our main concern just as the initiative of our president was so strategic, having recently visited France."

On 12 October 2015, Adewole was nominated as Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by Muhammadu Buhari.
The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) lauded his nomination and described him as a "round peg in a round hole suitable for president's change agenda". In his remarks, chairman of the union Professor Olusegun Ajiboye described the nomination as a "right step towards the change that Nigeria needs by appointing change agents who have achieved global recognition in their chosen academic career and have unblemished administrative records".

"The Guardian" reported that Dr. Ademola Aremu, the National Treasurer of the Union, said that the story of Prof. Adewole 'IFA' as we popularly called him is the story of someone who has been destined to serve humanity. His achievements as a provost of the college of medicine made him to receive overwhelming support from the university community when he indicated interest to serve on the university governing council and later on as vice chancellor. As vice chancellor, he totally turned the university around in terms of staff and student welfare, academically, University of Ibadan unarguably became the best in Nigeria and one of the best in Africa.

In the same vein, the chairman of the University of Ibadan Senior Staff Association of Universities Wale Akinremi said "the nomination of Prof. Isaac Folorunsho Adewole as a minister was received by the university of Ibadan community with great enthusiasm. We can vouch for his professional pedigree and administrative competence."

On 11 November 2015, Adewole was appointed as minister of health in Buhari's administration. He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to "The Nation", Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, we need to work together and working together means we can make a huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when we were young.

In his capacity as minister, Adewole was appointed by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to serve on the Independent High-level Commission on Non-Communicable Diseases from 2018 until 2019. In addition, he is a member of the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) Reference Group.

Adewole is one of Nigeria's most prolific writers in the medical field. He has authored over 200 scholarly articles in learned journals and over 20 books in various areas of medicine. In 2005, he authored "Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV" in Nigeria; the book was published by the Harvard University Press. In April 2011, he made a presentation on the topic at Global Health Week at Northwestern University, Chicago.
In 2007, he co-authored a training manual on sexual and reproductive health and rights and HIV prevention for medical students in Nigeria. The manual is currently being used in medical colleges in Nigerian universities.

He has attended over 100 scientific conferences in more than 20 countries and has presented posters and abstracts at numerous international conferences. For instance, at the International Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections organised held in 2009 in Montreal, Adewole presented his abstract on "Mother's Prophylaxis Regimen Strongly Predicts Risk of Early Mother-to-Child Transmission in Large ART Program in Nigeria".
In 2009, he attended the International Aids Conference held in South Africa, where he presented his abstract on the "Impact of Social Support in a PMTCT programme".

Cliché (Hush Hush)

Cliché (Hush Hush) is the reissue of Romanian recording artist Alexandra Stan's debut studio album, "Saxobeats" (2011). It was released for digital download on 2 October 2013 through Maan Studio; its deluxe edition was made available for digital and physical consumption on 23 October 2013 by Victor Entertainment. The record premiered following an alleged physical altercation with her former manager Marcel Prodan, which resulted in Stan taking a break from her career. Along with Andrei Nemirschi and Marcian Alin Soare, Prodan has written and produced nearly all the songs on "Cliché (Hush Hush)".

Being Stan's last activity with Prodan's label, the reissue additionally features three songs—"Lemonade", "Cliché (Hush Hush)" and "All My People"—which were released worldwide as singles, as intended for her second studio album. While "Lemonade" was certified Gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry (FIMI), the latter songs were moderately successful in Italy and Japan. Commercially, "Cliché (Hush Hush)" peaked at number fifty-three on the Oricon Albums Chart, having sold over 6,100 copies there.

Alexandra Stan's second studio album was delayed following an alleged physical altercation with her former manager Marcel Prodan. Stan accused him of physically attacking and blackmailing her; she also appeared injured on Romanian television. Due to this, the singer eventually decided to take a break from her career. Meanwhile, "Cliché (Hush Hush)", her last activity under Prodan's label—Maan Studio—was made available for consumption in Japan on 2 October 2013; a deluxe version of the record was released on 23 October 2013. It serves as a reissue of "Saxobeats" (2011), additionally containing three new songs—"Lemonade", "Cliché (Hush Hush)" and "All My People"—which were previously released as singles and were intended for her second studio album. The physical edition of the record is packaged in an obi-stripped jewel case, whose booklet features the cover art of "Saxobeats" on its back and lyrics in Japanese.

"Lemonade" was released as the first single from the reissue on 12 June 2012; its music video premiered on 4 June 2012. With music critics comparing the recording to the works of Ace of Base, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga and Kelis, "Lemonade" experienced commercial success in Europe and Japan. It peaked at number one in Bulgaria, and within the top forty in Hungary, Italy, Japan, Romania and Slovakia, being eventually certified Gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry (FIMI) for selling 15,000 copies in Italy. Subsequently, the title track of the record was made available for digital consumption on 3 October 2012, being promoted by a visual filmed by Iulian Moga at Palatul Snagov. The clip later drew comparison to vampire films for teenagers for a scene in which Stan is portrayed in a church surrounded by dark-clothed people. "Cliché (Hush Hush)" charted at number eleven on the Japan Hot 100, and at number fifty on Italy's FIMI chart. A "club-friendly" electro dance recording, "All My People", the last single from "Cliché (Hush Hush)" premiered on 1 May 2013 and featured the vocals of Prodan's fictional character, Manilla Maniacs. It was moderately successful in Italy, Japan and Romania, reaching the top sixty in the territories. The song's music video was compared by Alexandra Necula of Info Music to the work of Madonna, while its choreography to Michael Jackson's 1980s material.

All lyrics written and produced by Andrei Nemirschi and Prodan, unless stated.

Italian ironclad Regina Maria Pia

Regina Maria Pia was the lead ship of the of ironclad warships built in French shipyards for the Italian "Regia Marina" in the 1860s. She and her three sister ships were broadside ironclads, mounting a battery of four and twenty-two guns on the broadside. "Regina Maria Pia" was laid down in July 1862, was launched in April 1863, and was completed in April 1864.

"Regina Maria Pia" took part in the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. She attacked the unarmored frigates in the Austrian second division, and damaged two vessels. Her career was limited after the war, owing to the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was modernized again in the late 1880s. "Regina Maria Pia" was eventually broken up for scrap in 1904.

"Regina Maria Pia" was long overall; she had a beam of and an average draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. "Regina Maria Pia" was a broadside ironclad, and she was initially armed with a main battery of four guns and twenty-two guns, though her armament changed throughout her career. The ship was protected by iron belt armor that was thick and extended for the entire length of the hull at the waterline. The battery deck was protected by of iron plate. She had a crew of 480–485 officers and men.

The ship's propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller, with steam supplied by six coal-fired, rectangular boilers. Her engine produced a top speed of from . She could steam for at a speed of . The ship was initially schooner-rigged to supplement the steam engine, though her masts were later reduced to a barque rig. Ultimately, she lost her sailing rig completely, having it replaced with a pair of military masts with fighting tops.

"Regina Maria Pia" was built at the French shipyard "Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée" in La Seyne. Her keel was laid down on 22 July 1862 and her completed hull was launched on 28 April 1863. The ship was completed on 17 April 1864 and delivered to the Italian fleet. In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, as part of the Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, despite the fact that the Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram , "en route" from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.

Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on June 27, in an attempt to draw out the Italians. At the time, many of the Italian ships were in disarray;
several ships did not have their entire armament, and several others had problems with their engines. "Regina Maria Pia" was one of the few ironclads fit for action, so she, , , and formed up to prepare to attack Tegetthoff's ships. Persano held a council of war aboard "Principe di Carignano" to determine whether he should sortie to engage Tegetthoff, but by that time, the Austrians had withdrawn, making the decision moot. The Minister of the Navy, Agostino Depretis, urged Persano to act and suggested the island of Lissa, to restore Italian confidence after their defeat at the Battle of Custoza the previous month. On 7 July, Persano left Ancona and conducted a sweep into the Adriatic, but encountered no Austrian ships and returned on the 13th.

On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet out of Ancona, bound for Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought troop transports carrying 3,000 soldiers; the Italian warships began bombarding the Austrian forts on the island, with the intention of landing the soldiers once the fortresses had been silenced. In response, the Austrian Navy sent the fleet under Tegetthoff to attack the Italian ships. "Regina Maria Pia" was at that time in the 3rd Division, commanded by Captain Augusto Riboty, along with the ironclads , , and , and the coastal defense ship . After spending the 18th unsuccessfully bombarding the Austrian fortresses, the Italians withdrew late in the day, preparing to launch another attack the following morning. Persano sent most of his ships to bombard the town of Vis, but he was unable to effect the landing.

The next morning, Persano ordered another attack; four ironclads would force the harbor defenses at Vis while "Regina Maria Pia" and the rest of the fleet would attempt to suppress the outer fortifications. This second attack also proved to be a failure, but Persano decided to make a third attempt the next day. "Regina Maria Pia" and the bulk of the fleet would again try to disable the outer forts in preparation for the landing. Before the Italians could begin the attack, the dispatch boat arrived, bringing news of Tegetthoff's approach. Persano's fleet was in disarray; the three ships of Admiral Giovanni Vacca's 1st Division were three miles to the northeast from Persano's main force, and three other ironclads were further away to the west. Persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with Vacca's, first in line abreast formation, and then in line ahead formation. "Regina Maria Pia" initially was the last ship in the line, though "Varese" later joined up behind her.

Shortly before the action began, Persano decided to leave his flagship and transfer to "Affondatore", though none of his subordinates on the other ships were aware of the change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping "Re d'Italia", he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships and the rest of the fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee. He failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass, so he turned back toward Persano's ships, and took "Re d'Italia", "San Martino", and "Palestro" under heavy fire. The Austrians quickly inflicted serious damage on "Re d'Italia" and "Palestro". While Tegetthoff's ironclads were attacking Persano's division, Riboty's division, including "Regina Maria Pia", engaged Anton von Petz's division of unarmored steam frigates. In the melee, "Regina Maria Pia" collided with "San Martino", damaging the latter's ram bow.

After "Palestro" withdrew, the Austrian ironclads turned their attention to the ships of Riboty's division. By this time, "Re d'Italia" had been rammed and sunk, and "Palestro" was burning furiously. Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces, but his ships, low on coal and ammunition, and with badly demoralized crews, could not be rallied by Persano's half-hearted attempt to launch an attack. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. "Regina Maria Pia" had had one iron plate destroyed, and another had a steel shot lodged in it. She had been badly burned, and the flames had nearly reached her powder magazine. In return, she had damaged the Austrian ship of the line and the ironclad . After the battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.

For the rest of her long career, "Regina Maria Pia" served in a variety of roles, both in the main fleet and in Italy's colonial empire. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Italian naval budget was drastically reduced; so significant were the cuts that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Some time after 1866, the ship was rebuilt as a central battery ship, with most of her guns located in a central, armored casemate. Two other guns were placed in the bow as chase guns, with a third mounted as a stern chaser. At this time, her armament was also revised, to two guns in the bow and nine 8 in guns, four on each broadside and the last in the stern.

"Regina Maria Pia" took part in the launching ceremony for the ironclad on 29 September 1880; also present were the Italian ironclad and King Umberto I aboard his yacht, and the British ironclads and with Vice Admiral George Tryon, both members of the Mediterranean Fleet. Between 1888 and 1890, the ship had her barque rig replaced with military masts. By this time, she had been rearmed with eight guns in the casemate and several smaller guns for close-range defense against torpedo boats. These included five guns, four guns, and eight Hotchkiss revolver cannon. She also received three torpedo tubes. The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1904 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

Regina Maria Pia-class ironclad

The "Regina Maria Pia" class was a group of four ironclad warships built for the Italian "Regia Marina" (Royal Navy) in the 1860s. The class comprised four ships, , , , and . They were built by French shipyards, since Italian yards were unable to meet the demand of the rapidly expanding Italian fleet. The ships were broadside ironclads and mounted a battery of twenty-six muzzle loading guns.

All four ships saw action at the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. "Regina Maria Pia" was badly burned in the battle, but the other three vessels were not seriously damaged. The ships served in a variety of roles for the remainder of their long careers; they were modernized in the late 1880s and thereafter used as a training ships. "Regina Maria Pia", "San Martino", and "Ancona" were discarded in 1903–04, and "Castelfidardo" joined them in the breaker's yard in 1910.

Following the unification of Italy in 1861, the new "Regia Marina" (Royal Navy) began a construction program to prepare a fleet of ironclad warships capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice. The nascent Italian shipyards were incapable of building the number of ships the new fleet would require, so most of this first generation of ironclads were built by foreign ship builders. In 1862, the four ships of the "Regina Maria Pia" class were ordered from French shipyards, under the direction of Vice Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, then the Italian Navy Minister. These ships were designed by the French builders.

The ships of the "Regina Maria Pia" class varied in their dimensions. "Regina Maria Pia" and "San Martino", built by the same shipyard, were identical in size, while "Castelfidardo" and "Ancona", though each built by different shipyards, also were identical. The first two ships were long between perpendiculars and long overall, and they had a beam of and an average draft of . "Castelfidardo" and "Ancona" were between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam of and a draft of 6.35 m. The first two ships displaced normally and up to at full load, while "Castelfidardo" displaced normally and at full load. Curiously, "Ancona" was the lightest ship normally, at , but the heaviest at full load, at .

The ships were constructed with iron hulls. They were protected by iron belt armor that was thick and extended for the entire length of the hull at the waterline. The battery deck was protected by of iron plate. Each vessel had a crew of 480–485 officers and men. The ships were initially schooner-rigged to supplement the steam engine, though their masts were later reduced to a barque rig. Ultimately, they lost their sailing rig completely, having it replaced with a pair of military masts with fighting tops.

The ships' propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion, two-cylinder steam engine that drove a single screw propeller, with steam supplied by six coal-fired, rectangular boilers. The boilers were trunked into a single funnel placed amidships. Her engine produced a top speed of from . Each ship had a capacity of of coal, which allowed them to steam for at a speed of .

The "Regina Maria Pia" class were broadside ironclads, and they were initially armed with a main battery of four 72-pounder smooth-bore muzzle-loading guns and twenty-two 32-pounder rifled muzzle loaders, though their armament changed throughout her career. Most of these guns were placed on the broadside, but two of the 164 mm guns were mounted in an armored bunker forward and a third was placed in a similar mount at the stern, as chase guns. The ships were also fitted with a ram bow that was long.

In 1871, all four ships were re-armed with two muzzle-loading guns and eight 8 in muzzle-loading guns, with a ninth 8 in gun added in 1880. "Regina Maria Pia" and "San Martino" were later re-equipped with eight quick-firing (QF) guns, five QF guns, four QF guns, and eight Hotchkiss revolver cannon. In 1884, "Castelfidardo" received the same battery of light guns, though she had a sixth 4.7 in gun. When "Ancona" was similarly re-armed, she only had two of the 37 mm revolver cannon. All four ships were also equipped with three torpedo tubes, with the exception of "Castelfidardo", which received two tubes.

All four ships of the class entered service in time to see action during the Third Italian War of Independence against the Austrian Navy in 1866. Persano, now the commander of the Italian fleet, adopted a cautious strategy and conducted only one major offensive operation, which was directed at the island of Lissa. There, the Austrian fleet under Wilhelm von Tegetthoff attacked the Italians. The four "Regina Maria Pia"s all took part in the ensuing Battle of Lissa. "Regina Maria Pia" had been set on fire and badly burned in the battle, and minor fires were started by Austrian shells aboard "San Martino" and "Castelfidardo", but neither were seriously damaged. "Ancona" emerged relatively unscathed, with only minor damage to her iron plates.

After the war, the Italian naval budget was slashed; the cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. As the Italian fleet began to rebuild in the 1870s, the "Regina Maria Pia"s returned to active service in a variety of roles, both in the main fleet and in Italy's overseas empire. All four ships were modernized in the late 1880s, and were thereafter used as training ships. "Regina Maria Pia", "Ancona", and "San Martino" were stricken from the naval register in 1903–04, while "Castelfidardo" lingered on as a torpedo training ship until 1910, when she too was sold for scrapping.

French fry vending machine

A French fry vending machine is a vending machine that dispenses hot French fries, also known as chips. The first known french fry vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured French fry vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.

The now defunct Australian company Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. designed the first known French fry vending machine, named Mr. French Fry. The company registered the design with the Australian government in January 1982. The machine cooked hot chips within 60 seconds, and operated using three AUD $0.20 coins. A salt packet was included underneath the cup that the chips were served in.

Another company, Houser Vending Co., Inc., developed a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, which was used in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in 365 °F sunflower oil for around 40 seconds, and 500 orders of fries were prepared before the oil was changed. The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off in the event of a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher built into it.

Beyondte Technology, based in Shenzhen Province, China, began development of the Robo French fry machine in 2008, which delivers hot French fries in around 95 seconds. Beyondte Technology was acquired by Breaktime Solutions in Belgium. The machine was developed by Belgian entrepreneurs, and field tested in Brussels, Belgium during the summer of 2012. The machine weighs 750 pounds, and can cook French fries in beef fat or cooking oil. Breaktime Solutions adapted the machine to operate using beef fat, the development of which took a year. It requires manual servicing and cleaning after around 150 orders are prepared. Later developments included installation of a ventilation system that uses three filters to reduce odors emitting from the machine. "The New York Post" has referred to the Robo French fry machine as the "Rolls Royce of vending machines." In August 2013, an order of French fries from the machine was priced at USD $3.50. Customers can choose an accompaniment of mayonnaise or ketchup, and can optionally add harissa, all of which are provided in single-serving packets. The machine also dispenses a small fork.

E-Vend Technology, a Russian company, manufactures a French fry vending machine in China and Israel using technology from the United States. The machine uses frozen French fries, and prepares them in around 45 seconds using hot air, rather than cooking oil.

Fotolook, s.r.o., based in Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia markets a French fry vending machine.

After ten years of development, in January 2015 the Hot Chips Company in Perth, Australia released a hot chips vending machine that uses rice bran oil. The company stated plans to produce and market more machines sometime in 2015, and has developed four prototypes that were tested in Adelaide and Perth. The prototypes also supply condiments, including one named "chicken salt," which is chicken-flavored salt popular in Australia.

In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, students and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes from start to finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18 °C, and it cooks them in oil at 180 °C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.

Shaun Murphy

Shaun Peter Murphy (born 10 August 1982) is an English professional snooker player, who won the 2005 World Championship. Nicknamed "The Magician", Murphy is noted for his straight cue action and his long potting.

Born in Harlow and raised in Irthlingborough, Murphy turned professional in 1998. His victory at the World Championship was considered a major surprise as he was only the third qualifier to lift the title. His other ranking tournament victories came in the 2007 Malta Cup, the 2008 UK Championship, the Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 – Finals and the 2014 World Open, while he reached a second World Championship final in 2009 and a third in 2015. He has also won seven non-ranking tournaments, including the 2015 Masters, which completed his career Triple Crown.

Murphy has won over £3 million in prize money and has compiled more than 450 century breaks in his professional career. His highest world ranking was number three, which he maintained for three seasons following 2007/2008.

On 12 November 2017, Murphy won the Champion of Champions title beating Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final.

Born in Harlow, England, Murphy began playing snooker at the age of eight after his parents bought him a snooker table for Christmas. He made his first century break at the age of 10 and practised at the Rushden Snooker Centre, where players such as Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams, and Ken Doherty have also played. At the age of 13, he secured a five-year £5,000-a-year sponsorship deal with the Doc Martens shoe company and stated his ambitions of winning the World Championship and becoming world number one. He turned professional in 1998 at the age of 15.

Murphy was coached by Steve Prest until the 2006/2007 season. Willie Thorne and Ray Reardon also gave him guidance, and when he was 15, he was given the latter's old cue by his father.

Murphy began his career on the UK Tour in 1998 (renamed the Challenge Tour in 2000), at the time the second-level professional tour. He was runner-up in the fourth event on the UK tour for the 1997/1998 season and, for the 2000/2001 season, won the third and fourth events on the Challenge Tour, topping the Order of Merit rankings.

In 2000, he received the World Snooker Newcomer of the Year award and one of six Young Player of Distinction of the Year awards from the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. In 2000, he won the English Open Championship.

Murphy won his first professional tournament at the 2000 Benson & Hedges Championship, defeating Mark Davis 6–1 in the semi-final, and Stuart Bingham 9–7 in the final, recovering from 2–5 down. Although he was not yet on the first-level main tour, this victory brought qualification for the Masters—a prestigious non-ranking invitation tournament with places for members of the top 16, the winner of the qualifying tournament, and a limited number of wildcards. In the 2001 tournament, he showed promise in his first televised match, defeating world number 15, Marco Fu, and building a 4–1 lead over seven-time world champion Hendry, before losing the match. He made his first maximum break in the 2001 Benson & Hedges Championship.

Murphy first reached the final stages of a ranking event at the 2002 World Championship, hosted at the Crucible Theatre, where he lost 4–10 to Hendry in the first round. In the 2002/2003 season, he reached the final stages of the Scottish Open, where he was defeated 3–5 by Drew Henry in the first round, and the World Championship, where he lost 9–10 against Doherty on the final black in the first round.

For the 2003/2004 season, Murphy was ranked number 64 and qualified for the final stages of three ranking tournaments. In the LG Cup, Murphy defeated Steve Davis 5–4 in the second round, before losing 2–5 to John Higgins in third round. After the victory over Davis, Murphy said "This is one of the greatest days in my snooker career." In the British Open, he defeated Dave Harold 5–1 in the first round, before losing to Paul Hunter 2–5 in the second round.

In the Players Championship—the new name of the Scottish Open—he lost 3–5 to eventual champion Jimmy White in the second round. He failed to reach the World Championship, losing a qualifying match 7–10 against Stuart Pettman, in which Pettman was docked a frame for arriving late.

For the 2004/2005 season, Murphy was ranked number 48<ref name="04/05"></ref> and reached the final stages of four ranking events, including the World Championship victory. In the Grand Prix—the new name of the LG Cup—he lost 2–5 to Stephen Maguire in the first round. This was followed by his first ranking semi-final, at the British Open, where he was whitewashed 0–6 by Higgins. In the Malta Cup, he lost 2–5 to Matthew Stevens in the first round.

Murphy won two qualifying matches to qualify for the 2005 World Championship. He defeated former world champions Higgins 13–8, Davis 13–4, and Peter Ebdon 17–12 to reach the final to face Matthew Stevens, the world number six. He trailed Stevens 6–10 at the end of the first day (the World Championship final is played over two days), but made a comeback to bring the score to 16–16. He then made two frame-winning breaks to lift the title. His 11 century breaks were the most in that year's tournament.

Murphy's victory was considered a major surprise. His pre-tournament odds were 150–1, and before his win he was considered an underachiever. He became only the third qualifier to win the World Championship (or to reach the final) after Alex Higgins in 1972 and Terry Griffiths in 1979. At the age of 22, Murphy was the second youngest player to win the World Championship, following Hendry who first lifted the title when he was 21. No previous world champion had played as many matches (seven) to lift the title, and he was the lowest ranked player, at number 48, to win the tournament. No player had won the World Championship as his first ranking event win since Joe Johnson in 1986. His run in the tournament earned him the nickname "Magician" and the tournament doubled his previous career prize money, with which he purchased a Mercedes-Benz and a house. After his win, in July 2005, he married his fiancée Clare.

For the new season, he improved his ranking to number 21, which would not usually guarantee qualification for ranking events. However, as world champion he qualified automatically for every tournament in the season as the number two seed (and number one seed for the 2006 World Championship). He was invited to play in the Premier League Snooker, a non-ranking tournament with a 25-a-second shot clock, but he went out in the round-robin stage.

In the inaugural, non-ranking Northern Ireland Trophy, he reached the quarter-finals before he was defeated 4–5 by Neil Robertson. In the first three ranking events of the season—the Grand Prix, the UK Championship, and the Malta Cup—he reached the last 16, losing final-frame matches to Bingham, Robertson, and Graeme Dott, respectively. After his loss to Bingham, he complained about having to play his match on an outside table, given his world champion status. In the revival of Pot Black, a single-frame knockout tournament not staged since 1991, Murphy was defeated in the final by Stevens. Murphy was awarded Sportsman of the Year at the BBC East Midlands Sports Awards in December 2005.

In the Masters, Murphy lost 4–6 to Higgins in the quarter-finals, but reached his second ranking final in the Welsh Open, losing 4–9 to Stephen Lee. In the World Championship, he reached the quarter-finals, but fell victim to the so-called "Crucible curse" – no first-time champion has successfully defended the title at the Crucible Theatre— when he was defeated 7–13 by Ebdon.

For the next season, Murphy moved to number five in the world rankings, entering the elite top 16 for the first time, and thereby automatically qualifying for the final stages of ranking tournaments and receiving an automatic invitation to the Masters.

In the Northern Ireland Trophy (a ranking event in this season), he lost 4–5 to Lee in the quarter-finals, and in the UK Championship, he lost 3–9 to Alan McManus in the second round. A 3–6 defeat by Stephen Hendry in the quarter-finals of the Masters was followed by his second ranking title, when he defeated Ryan Day 9–4 in the final of the Malta Cup. After the victory, he said it was a relief to get rid of the one-hit wonder label. In his next match, a victory over Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open, he scored centuries in four consecutive frames, becoming only the second player to do this (after Higgins in the 2005 Grand Prix final) and the only person to do so in a best-of-nine match. He went on to lose 3–5 to Maguire in the quarter-finals. In the World Championship, Murphy defeated Stevens 13–12 in the quarter-finals—recovering from 5–11 down and knocking the latter out of the top 16—before losing 16–17 against Mark Selby in the semi-finals.

For the 2007/2008 season, he was ranked number three, his highest ever ranking, and reached at least the semi-finals of five ranking events, without winning any.

In the inaugural Shanghai Masters, he was defeated 2–5 by Ian McCulloch in the first round. He reached the final of the Pot Black, where he was defeated by Doherty. In the Grand Prix, he reached the semi-finals, where he lost 5–6 against Ronnie O'Sullivan, despite leading 5–2. Further semi-finals followed at the Northern Ireland Trophy and the UK Championship, where he was defeated on both occasions by Maguire, 5–6 and 5–9, respectively, making it three consecutive semi-final losses. Before the UK Championship, he was provisionally ranked number one. He successfully defended his Malta Cup title (that year the tournament was not a ranking event) with a 9–3 victory over Doherty in the final. In the China Open, he defeated Selby 6–3 in the semi-final—his sixth semi-final in the past seven ranking events—but lost 9–10 to Maguire in the final. Before the World Championship, he was again provisional number one.

In the World Championship, as one of the favourites, he reached the second round, before losing 4–13 to Ali Carter. After his loss, Murphy criticised the state of the tables.

Murphy maintained his number three ranking for the 2008/2009 season. He won the non-ranking Paul Hunter Classic, defeating Selby 4–0 in the final, but lost in the first round of the first four ranking tournaments, including a 4–5 defeat by world number 47 Mike Dunn in the Bahrain Championship. In October, Murphy and his wife separated, after three years of marriage; he did not wear his wedding ring in the Grand Prix.

Despite the four consecutive first-round losses—which had been attributed to the split from his wife—Murphy claimed his third ranking title at the UK Championship, defeating Fu 10–9 in a low-quality final, in which he fluked a pink in the deciding frame that was effectively match ball. The victory meant he joined Davis, Alex Higgins, Griffiths, John Parrott, Hendry, O'Sullivan, Williams, John Higgins and Ebdon as the tenth player to have won both the World title and the UK title.

In the World Championship, there were concerns that Murphy's estranged wife would serve him divorce papers during play of his first-round match against Andrew Higginson. He defeated Higginson 10–8 without incident, although his wife's parents were present in the arena and were asked to leave. He went on to defeat Fu 13–3, Hendry 13–11, and Robertson 17–14 to earn a place in his second world final, with two-time world champion Higgins as the opponent. In the final, he trailed 5–11 after the first day, and was beaten 9–18 by Higgins. On the first day of the final, a newspaper published a "kiss and tell" story involving Murphy.

Murphy maintained his number three ranking for a third year in the 2009/2010 season. He successfully defended his Paul Hunter Classic title, defeating White 4–0 in the final. He won the Premier League Snooker with a 7–3 win against O'Sullivan in the final, ending the latter's run of five consecutive wins in the tournament.

He reached the semi-finals of the first ranking tournament, the Shanghai Masters, before losing 5–6 against Liang Wenbo. This would be his only run to the semi-finals or better in a ranking tournament that season. In the UK Championship, as the defending champion, he lost 5–9 to eventual winner Ding Junhui in the second round. After the match, Murphy complained about Ding leaving the arena too often after frames, saying "I can't believe anyone needs to go to the toilet after every single frame." He reached the quarter-finals of the Masters, where he lost 4–6 against Williams. In the Welsh Open and the China Open, he lost his first-round matches to Stevens and Nigel Bond, respectively. In the World Championship, he defeated Gerard Greene and Ding, but lost 12–13 against Carter in the quarter-finals, despite leading 8–4. This was the first season in which he did not reach a final or better of a ranking tournament since the 2003/2004 season.

After three seasons ranked number three, he dropped to number seven for the 2010/2011 season. He won the Wuxi Classic, a non-ranking tournament held in China, defeating Ding 9–8, having recovered from 2–8 down. Murphy reached the semi-finals of the Paul Hunter Classic, now part of the Players Tour Championship minor-ranking series, but lost 2–4 against eventual winner Judd Trump. Murphy won the Brugge Open, the second European event of the Players Tour Championship, with defeating Matthew Couch 4–2 in the final. He reached the final of the Ruhr Championship, but lost 2–4 against John Higgins. Murphy finished 1st on the Players Tour Championship Order of Merit, couldn't defend his Premier League Snooker title, as he lost 1–7 against Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final. He then reached the semi-finals of the 2010 UK Championship, where he lost to eventual runner-up Mark Williams 8–9.

Murphy lost in the first round of the Masters 3–6 against Jamie Cope, in the second round of the German Masters 2–5 against Joe Swail and in the first round of the Welsh Open 0–4 against Matthew Stevens.

The next week Murphy also reached the final of the Championship League, but lost 1–3 against Matthew Stevens. Murphy reached the semi-final of the China Open, where he lost 1–6 against Judd Trump. Murphy's last tournament of the season was the World Championship, where he lost in the second round 10–13 against Ronnie O'Sullivan.

Murphy began the 2011/2012 season ranked number seven. He could not defend his Wuxi Classic title, as he lost 3–6 against Ali Carter. Murphy reached the semi-finals of the Australian Goldfields Open, but lost 2–6 against eventual champion Stuart Bingham. At the Shanghai Masters Murphy reached the quarter-finals, but lost 4–5 against Mark Selby. Murphy's next tournament was the Brazil Masters, where he defeated Graeme Dott 5–0 in the final. Murphy also participated at the Premier League and ended the league stage with two wins and four losses. As a result, he did not advance to the play-off. Murphy then reached the quarter-finals of the UK Championship, but lost 3–6 against Ricky Walden. He also participated at the Players Tour Championship, where his best results came at the Warsaw Classic and the Kay Suzanne Memorial Trophy, where he reached the quarter-finals, but lost 3–4 against Neil Robertson and 2–4 against Matthew Stevens respectively. He finished number 37 on the Order of Merit, and could not qualify to the Finals to defend his title.

Murphy reached his first Masters final, but lost 6–10 against Neil Robertson. Murphy then reached the semi-finals of the next two ranking tournaments, but lost 0–6 against Stephen Maguire at the German Masters, 2–6 against Ding Junhui at the Welsh Open. He then lost in the quarter-finals of the World Open 0–5 against Mark Selby. Murphy ended the season with two first round losses. He lost 2–5 against wild-card Lu Ning at the China Open and 8–10 against Jamie Jones at the World Snooker Championship.

Murphy began the 2012/2013 season ranked number six. The first tournament for Murphy was the Wuxi Classic, where he lost in the first round 1–5 against Ken Doherty. Murphy's next tournament was the Six-red World Championship, where he finished first in Group E with four wins out of five matches and advanced to the knock-out stage. There he defeated James Wattana, Barry Hawkins, Dominic Dale and Judd Trump to reach the final, but lost 4–8 against Mark Davis. He then reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Goldfields Open, but lost 4–5 against Peter Ebdon. Murphy went one better in the next two ranking tournaments, as he reached the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters and the International Championship, but lost 3–6 against John Higgins and 5–9 against Neil Robertson respectively. Murphy than reached the final of the 2012 UK Championship courtesy of two tight victories. The first against teenager Luca Brecel in the quarter-finals, after Brecel twice had the chance to pot the final pink and black to win the match, then against Ali Carter in which Murphy recovered from 4–8 down and 0–32 in points behind in the deciding frame to win 9–8. He was ultimately defeated by good friend Mark Selby 6–10 in the final. He also participated at the Players Tour Championship, with his best result coming at the third English event, where he reached the semi-finals, but lost 0–4 against Marco Fu. He finished number 29 on the Order of Merit, and couldn't qualify to the Finals.

Murphy began the year by reaching the semi-finals at the Masters, but lost 2–6 against Neil Robertson. He then reached the quarter-final of the German Masters, but lost 4–5 against Robertson.

In the quarter-final, he faced Judd Trump in a tense match that went to a deciding frame, after Trump won five consecutive frames from 7–12 down to level at 12–12. Trump ultimately prevailed in a nervy last frame to go through to the semi-final.

Murphy's 2013/2014 season began with a shock 1–5 defeat by Alex Davies in the qualifying round of the 2013 Wuxi Classic. The tournament was the first to use a new format that required top-16 players to compete in qualifiers.

Between August 2013 and January 2014, Murphy lost 3 stones (42 pounds or 19 kg) in weight, due to a new diet and fitness regime. He stated that one of his health and fitness goals was to improve his stamina and concentration at the table.

In group two of the 2014 Championship League, he made his second official maximum break in his round-robin match against Mark Davis.

In the first round of the Masters, Murphy came back from 2–4 behind to defeat Ding Junhui 6–4. He produced another comeback in the quarter-finals, where he trailed Marco Fu 1–4 before winning five frames in a row to clinch a 6–4 victory. He faced defending champion Mark Selby in the semi-finals, but lost 1–6.

In February 2014, while playing Jamie Jones in the last 16 of the minor-ranking Gdynia Open, Murphy made his second 147 break of the season and the third of his professional career. He went on to win the tournament, defeating Fergal O'Brien 4–1 in the final to capture his first title in 29 months. The following month, he defeated Selby 10–6 in the final of the World Open, winning the fifth ranking title of his career and his first ranking title in three years.

At the World Championship, Murphy defeated Jamie Cope 10–9 and Marco Fu 13–8 to reach the quarter-finals, where he faced defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan. Although Murphy won the first two frames and left O'Sullivan requiring three snookers in the third frame, O'Sullivan ultimately made the score 2–1 then won 12 of the next 13 to defeat Murphy 13–3 with a session to spare.

In October 2014, he won the Bulgarian Open defeating Martin Gould 4–2 in the final. Two weeks later he reached the final of the General Cup but lost 6–7 against Ali Carter. In November, he won the Ruhr Open beating Robert Milkins 4–0 in the final. In the second frame of the final he achieved the fourth maximum break of his career after missing out on the maximum on two previous occasions during that day, in matches against Joe Swail where Murphy made a break of 129 before missing the blue ball and in a match against Mark Williams with the break ending on the green ball and thus 122. In 2014, Shaun Murphy became the first player to make three maximums in a calendar year.

In January 2015, at the Masters, Murphy beat Mark Selby, Stephen Maguire and Mark Allen en route to the final against Neil Robertson. Murphy won the match 10–2, completing his career Triple Crown.

In the World Championship, Murphy, seeded eighth, beat Robin Hull 10–3, Joe Perry 13–5, Anthony McGill 13–8 and Barry Hawkins 17–9 to reach his third World Championship final, meeting tenth seed Stuart Bingham. In the final, despite leading 3–0 and 8–5, Murphy fell behind 11–14 in the third session. Despite fighting back to level the score at 15–15, Murphy lost the next three frames and the final 15–18.

Murphy has clashed with Stephen Maguire, another of the 2000 Young Players of Distinction, on several occasions. At the start of their 2004 Grand Prix match, there was an incident that resulted in Maguire being docked the opening frame. After they had shaken hands at the outset of the first frame, Maguire asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena and retrieve his chalk, which he had forgotten. While Maguire was away, the referee and Murphy spoke before tournament director Mike Ganley arrived on the scene and docked Maguire a frame for technically not being ready to start at the scheduled time, which angered and surprised Maguire. Murphy refutes that the docking of the frame was down to him speaking to the referee. Maguire won the match 5–2 and later commented: "Rules are rules but I've never heard of anything like that happening before".

Further incidents came in subsequent years. During the 2006 World Championship, Maguire said "I don't want to be a fat world champion", a reference to Murphy. After beating Murphy in the 2007 Welsh Open, Maguire said of the chalk incident, "That put the icing on the cake, but we've always had a rivalry. I dislike him and I think he dislikes me. I try hard to beat everyone, but it would have hurt more if I'd lost to him." Murphy currently leads the head-to-head 14–11.

Murphy has been outspoken about several other of his rivals, criticising them for having too many toilet breaks and complaining about table conditions among other things. Murphy also makes collective criticisms of his fellow professionals for not attending events and has branded other players' concerns over prize money as a joke. Murphy's harshest criticism has been reserved for Ronnie O'Sullivan. Murphy highlights what he perceives to be O'Sullivan's lack of professionalism.

Murphy is noted for his straight cue action—which Steve Davis once called "the best cue action I've ever seen"—his long potting, and his breakbuilding. Phil Yates wrote in 2008 in "The Times" that Murphy has improved his tactical game since his World Championship victory. He has compiled more than 400 century breaks and has made five maximum breaks. His career earnings amount to more than £3 million.

Murphy was born in Harlow and grew up in Irthlingborough. He was home-schooled from age 13 after being bullied at school, and his parents split up when he was 14. He lived with his father Tony, a former professional golfer, and did not see his mother again until he was 19. During the 2007 World Championship, it was reported that he had developed a rift with his father, who was a member of the World Snooker board. He said that they had not spoken in over a year, but that he would willingly speak to his father again if the other called him.

Murphy moved to Rotherham during the 2004 season to be with his fiancée, Clare, whom he married in July 2005. Murphy's wife filed for divorce in 2009 on the grounds of infidelity after "The People" newspaper published an exposé revealing he had spent the night with an escort girl he had met at a religious youth group. Murphy's then manager, Brandon Parker, issued a statement confirming that Murphy had slept with the woman but denied he had been unfaithful, stating that Murphy did not have sex with her. He also dated Claire Chorlton, who was first introduced to the viewing public backstage during the final of the 2012 UK Championship. 
Murphy became engaged to his girlfriend Elaine, after proposing marriage at a restaurant in her native Ireland during Christmas 2014. The couple married in June 2016, and have since had a son. Murphy lives just outside Nottingham.

Murphy became a Christian at the age of 15, after meeting a religious family on holiday. Murphy is well known for his charitable nature, having spent some of the summer of 2006 doing aid work in Zimbabwe with his then wife, Clare. He also donated one-tenth of his 2005 World Championship winnings to the church, and at the 2012 World Snooker Championship Murphy donated £100 to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital Charity for every century he made.

You Don't Know Anything

"You Don't Know Anything" is a song by American indie rock band Ivy. It was released by Atlantic Records on April 29, 1999 as the fourth and final single from their second studio album, "Apartment Life" (1997). The single was made available exclusively in Europe and featured the same two B-sides as previous single, "This Is the Day", which had been released by 550 Music in Austria. The track was written by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase while production was handled by the latter two and Peter Nashel.

Released alongside "This Is the Day", "You Don't Know Anything" received promotion by Atlantic Records after the former track was included on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, "There's Something About Mary". The recording received generally favorable reviews from music critics who compared the song to the works of Irish rock group My Bloody Valentine.

"You Don't Know Anything" was written by Ivy band members Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase. The production of the track was handled by Chase and Schlesinger, with additional production provided by Peter Nashel. Musically, "You Don't Know Anything" is a pop rock/indie rock song, also incorporating elements of indie pop and guitar accords. Lyrically, the song discusses a lover being "clueless" and "in the wrong".

The single was heavily compared to My Bloody Valentine; in their review of the track, Sputnikmusic stated that it "comes off like a My Bloody Valentine song with intelligible vocals, with a sliding, reverb heavy hook and pummeling drums", while AllMusic writer Jack Rabid drew similar comparisons. Patrick Carmosino of "West Net" stated that with "You Don't Know Anything", Ivy "have an indie-ethic rock side that compliments their pop sensibilities to the tee".

The recording was released simultaneously with the release of the single "This Is the Day"; this occurred after the latter track was featured in the 1998 film, "There's Something About Mary". "You Don't Know Anything" was released as a CD single exclusively in European countries; the CD included two B-side tracks, "Sleeping Late" and "Sweet Mary".

"You Don't Know Anything" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thompson of "The A.V. Club" praised the track and "Apartment Life" for "sound[ing] slickly pretty and mannered". A reviewer from Sputnikmusic also enjoyed the recording, calling it a "mid-album stand out", while AllMusic named the song "a knockout" and praised it for allowing "the guitars [to] get mean". Reviewer Scott Floman was more mixed with his review, finding the track to "pass by pleasantly but unremarkably".

The Best Thing (Ivy song)

"The Best Thing" is a song by American band Ivy on their second studio album, "Apartment Life" (1997). Released on September 12, 1997 by Atlantic Records, it was the band's major-label debut single and served as the parent album's lead single. The track was written by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, and was produced by the latter two. A pop song, "The Best Thing" is accompanied by several guitars and a keyboard.

It was distributed to radio stations for airplay in September 1997, coinciding with the release of two CD singles. It was also released as a 7" single in Italy, where it was paired with the B-side track "A Nanny in Manhattan", performed by the American band Lilys. music critics praised "The Best Thing", with several calling it one of the catchiest tracks on "Apartment Life".

"The Best Thing" was taken from Ivy's second studio album, "Apartment Life", which was released on October 7, 1997 by Atlantic Records. It was recorded in 1997 in New York City at three different recording studios. The single was released in three formats; the commercial CD single includes the album version of "The Best Thing" while a promotional Italy 7" jukebox single, released by East West Records, used Ivy's song as the A-side and Lilys "A Nanny in Manhattan" as the B-side. Another promotional CD single was also created containing the "Video Remix" of the track.

According to the liner notes of the promotional release, Atlantic Records billed "The Best Thing" as Ivy's official debut single. Following its distribution as a physical single, "The Best Thing" was serviced to modern rock and modern adult contemporary radio stations beginning September 12, 1997. The record label had hoped that Ivy would receive considerable radio airplay, in light of musical trends during the same time period when "Apartment Life" was scheduled to be released. Michael Krumper, the vice president of product development for Atlantic Records, predicted this, given that "there are a number of records that have a similar feel to Ivy".

Prior to the scheduled release date for "Apartment Life", Ivy was scheduled for a promotional radio tour in September 1997. Around this same time, "Billboard" announced that a music video for "The Best Thing" would complete filming and production by the end of the same month; however, an official video was never released for the single, despite another "Billboard" article describing preparations for filming in November of that same year.

"The Best Thing" was written by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, with the latter two also serving as producers. Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade contributed as the mixers, with Matthew Ellard serving as an assistant mixer; Bob Ludwig finalized the mastering and James Iha contributed backing vocals to the track. It was recorded in New York City in 1997 at three recording studios: The Place, Duotone Studios, and Compositions. A pop song, it features "rippling atmospherics" and a "punk-ish guitar", with a user from Sputnikmusic commenting that it may have been influenced by the American band Pixies. Its production consists of a "briskly strummed" acoustic guitar and a triplet-playing keyboard. Durand "stretch[es] out each syllable" while singing in a style that is reminiscent of the German musician Nico during the lyrics: "She's driving fast / She took the family car / She's getting high / She's never slipped so far". As the chorus begins, she repeats "It's the best thing / She's ever had" regularly alongside several guitars.

"The Best Thing" was praised by music critics. AllMusic's Jack Rabid was extremely positive, calling it a "true single with a chorus that is to swoon and croon for". Vickie Gilmer and Ira Robbins from "Trouser Press" described the song as an "engaging opener" and lauded it and album track "I've Got a Feeling" for being catchy. Frank Tortorici from MTV News agreed, and predicted that it would likely "succeed at radio if given a chance". Calling it "sensuous", Stephen Thompson from "The A.V. Club" claimed that the rest of "Apartment Life" does not match the quality of "The Best Thing", but also stated that the entire album "never slips too far" because the end product includes "impeccably tasteful performances".

William Walker (Australian cricketer)

William Holden Walker (16 December 1835 – 14 June 1886) was an English-born Australian cricketer. As captain of the Tasmanian cricket team, Walker was one of Tasmania's leading cricketers of his time. Known for his all-round capabilities, he was a right-handed batsman and an underarm bowler, as well as keeping wicket. Walker was named in the Cricket Tasmania Premier League's "Team of the Decade" for the decade spanning 1866–67 to 1875–76.

Walker was born in Islington, London in 1835, the son of Holden and Mary Waldegrave Walker. During his early years in England, when Walker started playing cricket, his team came to be known as the "Walker team". From England, Walker moved to Tasmania in 1859, and then to Launceston in 1862, where he became an employee of the soliciting firm Messrs Douglas & Collins. In 1866, he became the Council Clerk and Clerk of Petty Sessions for the town of Fingal. Subsequently, he was employed with solicitors Messrs Gill and Ball, Messrs Dobson and Mitchell and later became an accountant at Messrs Elliston and Featherstone.

Walker was a right-handed batsman and right-arm underarm bowler. One of Tasmania's leading cricketers of his time, his score of 60 in an 1860 North versus South Tasmania game set a record of being the highest individual score in such matches. In his profile of Walker for "ESPNcricinfo", the sports writer Thomas Rose said: "He impressed in representative games and was often the shining light of a rather dismal Tasmanian side..."

After moving to Launceston, Walker made cricket famous in the city, captaining the Northern Tasmania cricket team. During the 1860s and 1870s, Walker also played for two clubs – Derwent and Wellington – under the then Tasmanian Cricket Association, standing out by scoring a century in one of his appearances.

Walker's first-class cricketing career spanned six years, from 1872 to 1878. He played two first-class cricket matches as captain of the Tasmanian cricket team during that period, scoring 73 runs and taking five wickets. During Cricket Tasmania's 150th anniversary celebrations, Walker was named as a member of the Cricket Tasmania Premier League's "Team of the Decade" for the decade 1866/67 – 1875/76 for having scored one of the only two centuries in Tasmania by any cricketer for the decade 1866 – 1875.

Walker took 60 wickets in the 1875–76 domestic season at an average of 8.47 runs per wicket, the best for all bowlers of the season. Walker was also a highly skilled wicket-keeper. Despite his all-round capabilities, Walker was best recognised and remembered for his impressive contributions as an inspirational captain, coming out as the best player in many matches irrespective of his team's performance.

At the age of 50, after suffering a very short illness, Walker died on 14 June 1886, at Pressland House, Hobart, Tasmania, with his funeral being held two days later. "The Mercury" wrote in its obituary on 15 June 1886: "Cricketers will learn with regret of the death, after a very short illness, of Mr. William Holden Walker, one of the oldest votaries of this thoroughly English game in the colony... Mr. Walker, who previous to his departure from England, was a member of the well-known Walker Team, brought cricketing into great prominence in Launceston... His efforts in the cause of cricket are so well known that they require no comment, but his sudden demise will cause a pang among the many friends who admired his genial and gentlemanly temperament."

Around a month after his death, on 13 July 1886, an amount of £590 from his estate was issued over as probate.

<doc id="48990432" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48990432" title="Leavin' (album)">
Leavin' (album)

Leavin is the 12th studio album by American recording artist Natalie Cole, released on September 26, 2006, by Verve Records. The album consists of ten cover versions of various R&B and pop songs and two original songs: "5 Minutes Away" and "Don't Say Goodnight (It's Time for Love)". It was the second of Cole's albums to be released by Verve Records, and her first album in four years, following "Ask a Woman Who Knows" (2002)"." Cole promoted the album as a return to her R&B roots, distancing herself from an identification as a jazz artist.

Critics gave the album generally positive reviews, praising Cole's interpretations of the covered material, and compared her favorably to contemporary R&B artists. The album peaked at number 97 on the "Billboard" 200 chart in the United States, and charted in Germany and Switzerland. It spawned one single – Cole's cover of Aretha Franklin's 1972 song "Day Dreaming" – with an accompanying music video. She performed the song at the BET special "An Evening of Stars: Tribute to Aretha Franklin." She embarked on a theatre tour in the fall of 2006 to support the album.

Co-executive producer David Munk suggested the concept for "Leavin'" as a way for Natalie Cole to return to R&B through "an intimate, classic soul CD with a small group of sidemen and simple production". He described the Atlanta recording sessions as eclectic, and said: "[Cole] shared with me her hope of making a country-soul record in Memphis; she also spoke of doing a piano-voice album and of recording in Spanish". During a 2006 interview with "American Songwriter", Cole said "Leavin"' had been "born out of desperation", as she wanted to record pop and urban music rather than jazz. She sought to avoid being typecast as only a jazz singer through returning to R&B and demanding more artistic control. As an arranger on the album, she said the recording sessions reminded her of how she "missed the freedom ... ad-libbing, you know, and being able to holler every now and then ... all of that energy".

Cole initially looked for original songs to record for the album, but criticized "the songs being sent [as] pretty bad". According to "Vibe", Cole decided to do a cover album to establish a connection between song and interpreter and between singer and audience" and appeal to "fans yearning for the good old days before they had to hire a sitter to go see a show". She later clarified that she was unable to record original musical since "we're doing a contemporary urban record on a jazz budget".

While promoting the album, Cole described R&B, rock, and pop as being her "forte", and said that she wished the recorded "Leavin"' "at least five years ago". Discussing her dissatisfaction with being labeled a jazz singer and her desire to showcase her versatility, she said that she wanted to "put out some music that we hadn't heard in a long time from anybody, really". The project was Cole's first collaboration with Dallas Austin. Rashod Ollison of "The Virginian-Pilot" wrote the album represented how "[Cole] had hung up the gowns and returned to her soul roots"; in past performances, Cole would wear gowns when singing jazz. During the production, Verve Records stipulated that it must include original material. One of the two new songs "Five Minutes Away" was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, "CBS News"' Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards." She connected the project to Cole's decision to reinvent herself, saying that its title represented "leaving the past behind".
"Leavin" is a contemporary R&B and pop music album consisting of twelve tracks, with an additional remix on digital copies. Cole said the material "has given me the opportunity to explore the greatness in the songs of some of our most talented and gifted songwriters," emphasizing the album's "fresh new twist on some great music".

The album opens with Cole's cover of Fiona Apple's "Criminal" (1997). Len Righi of "The Morning Call" wrote that Cole transformed the song from an "agonizing, brazen lament" into "a funky, Tina Turner-type, rump-shaker." The second track is a cover of Neil Young's 1972 single "Old Man"; David Munk called it "a personal rumination on her father". The third song, a cover of Aretha Franklin's "Day Dreaming" (1972), was recorded after Austin sang it in the studio. Cole said she "added a little bit of a hip-hop feel to it". Richard Harrington of "The Washington Post" felt that the fourth track, a cover of Shelby Lynne's "Leavin'" (1999), "metaphorically put a little distance between the original R&B diva and the pop star Cole". The fifth song is a cover of Ronnie Dyson's 1976 track "The More You Do it (The More I Like It Done to Me)"; NPR's Jason King attributes the inclusion of "the saucy but largely forgotten Yancy-Jackson mid-'70s track" to his suggestion to Cole's A&R director. The song contains a homage to Cole's 1975 single "This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)". The seventh track is a cover of Dobie Gray's 1973 single "Loving Arms" (here titled "Lovin' Arms"), which Verve Records marketed as inspired by Etta James.

The eighth track on the album is a cover of Bonnie Raitt's "Love Letter" (1989), and the following song "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" (1978) was described as an "ethereal" take on the Kate Bush original. Maura Johnston of "Rolling Stone" wrote that the original song "5 Minutes Away" was a "rumination on love and life accented by dry horns and capped with a rousing call-and-response". The tenth track is the second original song "Don't Say Goodnight (It's Time for Love)", written by Cole, Ernie Isley, and Chris Jasper. Cole explained that she included the cover of Des'ree's "You Gotta Be" (1994) as the eleventh song on the album due to the positive fan response to her prior performances; she described it as an example of her experimentation with "bringing a jazzy flavor to some pop songs". The album concludes with a cover of Sting's "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You" (1993), which emphasizes its spiritual context through the addition of four Beatitudes. An acoustic version of "Lovin' Arms" featuring Keb' Mo' was included as a digital bonus track.

"Leavin"' was first released by Verve Records on CD and MP3 download in the United States on September 26, 2006. In 2010, it was made available in Europe, Indonesia, and Russia on CD. To promote the album, Cole was slated to appear on "a number of major morning and late night television programs" to perform "several intimate showcases" of her music. She also embarked on a theater tour in the fall of 2006. It was her first club-sized tour in roughly two decades. Cole had chosen to sing her 1970s hits in an attempt to draw more R&B fans. She also decided to perform every song from the record, saying she couldn't "remember when a performer took a whole album and performed it onstage".

"Day Dreaming" was released as the lead single from the album on August 1, 2006. Director Doug Biro shot the accompanying music video, which features Cole singing with her band in front of a white background. The song earned Cole a nomination at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, but she lost to Mary J. Blige for her 2005 single "Be Without You". Cole performed "Day Dreaming" at the BET special "An Evening of Stars: Tribute to Aretha Franklin" along with an arrangement of Franklin's 1970 single "Call Me".

"Leavin" received positive reviews from music critics. The album was called a "treat for any Cole fan" by Andy Kellman of AllMusic"," who drew attention to how it sounds like it was recorded at a "leisurely pace". Continuing this thought, Kellman noted that Cole was "breez[ing] through an easygoing set of covers". The BBC's Chris Rogers defined the album as "an ultra smooth mix of standards both tasteful and obtuse". Jay S. Jacobs of PopEntertainment.com compared "Leavin"' to Cole's 1999 release, "Snowfall on the Sahara", and viewed it as "jazzy but decidedly more modern and surprisingly strong". "People"'s Ralph Novak, Chuck Arnold, V. R. Peterson, and Monica Rizzo commended Cole's decision to "ditch the evening-gown fare on her new CD" by recording more contemporary songs. Gugu Mkhabela from News24 awarded the album three out of five stars, describing the material as "pure old school with a modern twist", with Cole providing "a touch of class and some depth to boot".

Critics positively compared "Leavin"'s to works by other R&B artists. Rogers wrote that it was a perfect fit for listeners of Joss Stone and Jamie Cullum. Daniel Garrett of The Compulsive Reader listed the record alongside Ella Fitzgerald's "The Best of the Song Books" (1993) and Diana Ross' "Blue "(2006), praising each woman as the "three ladies of song". "Honolulu Star-Bulletin"'s Gary C.W. Chun favorably compared "Leavin" to Gladys Knight's "Before Me" (2006)"." Rogers wrote that Cole's vocal performance demonstrated a "tasteful restraint" and was an improvement over contemporary artists. He felt that Cole's voice was better than the "modulated warbling that seems to pass for contemporary R&B these days".

"Leavin" reached a peak position of number 97 on the "Billboard" 200, and spent two weeks on the chart. It also peaked "Billboard's" R&B Albums at number 16, spending eight weeks on the chart. In Germany, the album peaked on the German Album Charts at number 92. In Switzerland, it reached a peak position of number 76 on the Swiss Album Charts. Two years following its release, the album had sold roughly 57,000 copies.

SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max (1865)

SMS "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was the lead ship of the of broadside ironclads built for the Austrian Navy in the 1860s. She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, with her keel laying in October 1863, launching in May 1865, and commissioning in June 1866 at the outbreak of the Third Italian War of Independence and the Austro-Prussian War, fought concurrently. The ship was armed with a main battery of sixteen 48-pounder guns, though the rifled guns originally intended, which had been ordered from Prussia, had to be replaced with old smoothbore guns until after the conflicts ended.

Stationed in the Adriatic Sea, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" served as the flagship of the Austrian fleet under Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff. She saw action at the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, where she rammed and sank the Italian ironclad . Slightly damaged in the collision, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" had her bow repaired in Malta after the war. She remained in the Austro-Hungarian fleet for the next twenty years, but severely reduced naval budgets owing to Hungarian disinterest in naval matters led to an uneventful career. She was rearmed with newer guns in 1874 and again in 1882. Stricken from the naval register in May 1886, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was employed as a tender to the gunnery training school from 1889 to 1908. She remained in the inventory until 1916 when she was broken up for scrap.

"Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was long overall; she had a beam of and an average draft of . She displaced . She had a crew of 511. Her propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion steam engine, manufactured by the "Stabilimento Tecnico" shipyard in Fiume, that drove a single screw propeller. The number and type of her coal-fired boilers have not survived. Her engine produced a top speed of from .

"Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was a broadside ironclad, and she was armed with a main battery of sixteen 48-pounder muzzle-loading guns. She also carried several smaller guns, including four 8-pounder guns and two 3-pounders. The ship's hull was sheathed with wrought iron armor that was thick on the battery and reduced to at the bow and stern.

"Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was laid down at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste on 6 May 1863. She was launched on 24 May 1865; the builders were forced to complete fitting-out work quickly, as tensions with neighboring Prussia and Italy erupted into the concurrent Austro-Prussian War and the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max"s rifled heavy guns were still on order from Krupp, and they could not be delivered due to the conflict with Prussia. Instead, the ship was armed with old smooth-bore guns. Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana. With his flag aboard "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max", Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on 26 June in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, refused to engage Tegetthoff. Tegetthoff made another sortie on 6 July, but again could not bring the Italian fleet to battle.

On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet, with twelve ironclads, out of Ancona, bound for the island of Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought troop transports carrying 3,000 soldiers. Persano then spent the next two days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing. Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between the 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack, which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main bases at Pola and Venice. By the morning of the 19th, however, he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective, and so he requested permission to attack. As Tegetthoff's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt. The latter's ships were divided into three groups, with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians. Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge-shaped formation, leading with "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" at the center; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions followed behind in the same formation.
While he was forming up his ships, Persano transferred from his flagship, to the turret ship . This created a gap in the Italian line, and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt. During the second attempt, Austrian gunfire had disabled "Re d'Italia"s rudder, leaving her incapable of maneuvering. Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to ram the Italian vessel, and ordered his ship to maximum speed. After two collisions that occurred at angles too oblique to inflict serious damage, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" struck the ship more directly. The Austrian ship's ram tore a gaping hole in "Re d'Italia"s hull on the port side, though "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" sustained no significant damage herself. Tegetthoff reversed course, allowing the Italian ironclad to lurch back to port and quickly sink. Tegetthoff initially ordered his crew to lower boats to pick up the Italians struggling in the water, but the Italian ironclad was approaching, and he could not allow his ship to become a stationary target. Instead, he ordered the aviso to remain behind and pick up the survivors while "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" engaged "San Martino". The other Italian ships, however, did not realize "Kaiserin Elizabeth" was attempting to pick up the Italian survivors, and so opened fire on her, driving her away from the men in the water.

By this time, the coastal defense ship was burning badly, soon to be destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, having lost two ships, and though his squadron still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance so as not to risk his success. Additionally, the Austrian ships were slower than their Italian counterparts, and so they could not force a second engagement. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" had fired 156 shells in the course of the battle. She had kept boarding parties on her deck, ready to attack Italian vessels, but the opportunity had not presented itself in the engagement; steam powered ships could simply reverse course and disengage before a boarding party could cross over. "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was not significantly damaged by Italian fire or the ramming attempts. A few armor plates were slightly dislodged, the paint had been stripped from the hull where she had collided with "Re d'Italia", and she had a minor leak from the concussion, but she was otherwise unscathed.

After returning to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting and led to the Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. With the war over, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" went into the British Royal Navy shipyard in Malta to have her bow repaired. As a result of Austria's defeat, Kaiser Franz Joseph was forced to accede to Hungarian demands for greater autonomy, and the country became Austria-Hungary in the "Ausgleich" of 1867. The two halves of the Dual Monarchy held veto power over the other, and Hungarian disinterest in naval expansion led to severely reduced budgets for the fleet. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.

In 1869, Kaiser Franz Joseph took a tour of the Mediterranean Sea in his imperial yacht ; "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max", her sister ship , and a pair of paddle steamers escorted the Kaiser for the trip to Port Said at the mouth of the Suez Canal. The two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean while the other vessels passed through the Canal into the Red Sea in company with Empress Eugenie of France aboard her own yacht. The Austro-Hungarian ships eventually returned to Trieste in December. In 1874 she was rearmed with a battery of fourteen muzzle-loading Armstrong guns and four light guns. Her battery was revised again in 1882, with the addition of four breech-loader guns, two breech-loaders, a pair of quick-firing revolver guns, and three auto-cannons. "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was stricken from the naval register on 19 May 1886 and her armament was reduced to eight guns. The following year, these were removed and a single gun and a gun were installed. From 1889 to 1908, she served as a tender to the gunnery training school. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1916 during World War I.

Abramski v. United States

Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. ___ (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court found that making arrangements for a straw purchase of a gun is in violation of the Gun Control Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased gun. In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.

Initially, Abramski's defense was that (a) the misrepresentation was not material since his uncle was legally capable of making the purchase himself, and (b) since the answer to the question of whether he was purchasing the gun for himself was not required to be kept on the firearms dealer's record, no law was violated. However, when the case came before the Supreme Court, Abramski modified his defense and claimed that the misrepresentation was not material because the law only cares about the person buying the gun from the dealer, not the final receiver of the gun. The Court disagreed with this interpretation and held that the law cared about the final receiver, which is properly considered the person buying the gun. Such straw arrangements, the Court held, are different from allowed transfers where a person buys a gun for himself and later decides to sell it. Accordingly, the Court found that the misrepresentation was material. Additionally, the Court found that the answer was required to be kept on the dealer's record. The Court thus held that the purchase violated 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6), which makes it unlawful to falsify facts "material to the lawfulness of the sale," and 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits misrepresentation with respect to information which a dealer is required to maintain on record. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the declaration about the ultimate recipient of the gun was not material to the sale, and that it is not included in the information that the dealer is required to keep on the records. After the ruling, proponents of gun control stated that the Court's decision will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, while opponents of gun control stated that the ruling is a "horrible injustice".

The Gun Control Act of 1968 regulates the sale and transfer of guns. Section 922(a)(6) of the act makes it unlawful for any person acquiring a gun from a gun dealer to "knowingly ... make any false or fictitious ... written statement ... likely to deceive" the dealer, "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale." Section 924(a)(1)(A) of the same act, makes it unlawful and provides a penalty for anyone who "knowingly makes any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records of a firearms dealer under this chapter." These provisions of the Act only apply to purchasers in the "primary market," that is purchasers buying guns from gun dealers. The provisions do not apply to the "secondary market," that is second hand guns sold or gifted by a private party.

Bruce Abramski, a former Roanoke, Virginia, police officer, offered to buy his uncle, Angel "Danny" Alvarez, a resident of Pennsylvania, a Glock 19 handgun at a police discount. Agreeing, Alvarez sent Abramski a check, for $400, which stated "Glock 19 handgun" in the memo line. Abramski proceeded to purchase the gun, and filled the required ATF Form 4473. Question 11.a. on the form asks: "Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you." Abramski's answer to this question was "yes". After passing the background checks, and receiving the gun, Abramski contacted a federally licensed firearms dealer (FFL) in Pennsylvania, which conducted its own background check on Alvarez and then proceeded to transfer the gun to Alvarez through the FFL. Completing the transaction, Abramski deposited the check and received a receipt from Alvarez. Later, Abramski was suspected of committing a bank robbery, and his house was searched by Federal agents who found the receipt.

After being indicted by a grand jury, Abramski moved to dismiss the indictment. Abramski claimed that: (1), his misrepresentation on Question 11.a. was not "material to the lawfulness of the sale," under § 922(a)(6), since Alvarez was able to lawfully purchase the gun; and (2), since the answer to Question 11.a. is not "required ... to be kept in the records" of the gun dealer, the false statement is not in violation of §924(a)(1)(A). The District Court denied both motions, and Abramski entered a conditional guilty plea, where he reserved the right to challenge the sentence. Abramski was then sentenced to five years of probation on every count. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court's conviction.

The Supreme Court noted that the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying the answer to Question 11.a is not considered material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's defense had changed, and he now claimed that the answer to Question 11.a is "never" material. Various parties filed "amicus" briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed "amicus" briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.

The Court held that despite not mentioning the words "straw buyers", the federal gun law that regulates transactions with "persons" or "transferees" considers the "persons" or "transferees" to be the ones getting the gun at the end of the day, not the straw persons completing the transaction on their behalf. Failure to interpret the law in such way, the Court held, would undermine the purpose of the law, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. "Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by." The majority found Abramski's theory, that the federal law only cares about the person that is buying the gun and not the final buyer not to be true. The Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Kagan, held that if you interpret the terms "person" and "transferee," to mean "the man at the counter", you would undermine the purpose of the statutes, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Court therefore preferred to interpret the terms "person," and "transferee," to mean "the man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm".

The Court further stated that although congress allowed the resale and gifting of a gun by an individual, without requiring form or background checks, that is not proof that congress did not care about straw buyers. "Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers' sales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely untouched ... And yes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress does) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw arrangements are not a part of the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer's sale." The Court also rejected Abramski's claim that since Alvarez was able to buy the gun legally on his own the misrepresentation is not material, stating: "Abramski's false statement was material because had he revealed that he was purchasing the gun on Alvarez's behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to be an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter, would not have complied with §922(c)'s restrictions on absentee purchases." The court held that Abramski's case is analogous to a situation where a person that can buy a gun legally buys a gun under an alias. Such misrepresentation is material regardless of the fact that the buyer may purchase a gun legally, and the theory of "no harm, no foul" should not apply. Finally, the Court rejected Abramski's claim that the misrepresentation is not in violation of §924, because it is not part of what the dealer is statutorily required to maintain on his record. The Court held that §924 requires the dealer to maintain information "required by this chapter", and that ATF Form 4473 is required by this chapter.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Fourth Circuit against Abramski.

Dissenting, Justice Scalia would have held that although Abramski made a false statement by claiming that he was the buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale," which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the "agency law" principle to determine that Abramski was a third party's common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the "person" buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is "rendered meaningless" simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that the answer to the question of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list. The dissent stated that the majority's interpretation ultimately carried the text too far. "[I]f the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer's favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime." Justice Scalia concluded with the statement:

Although not considered a "ground breaking rule" by some law reviewers, the case received responses from both proponents and opponents of gun control. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which was the only gun prevention group to file an "amicus" brief hailed the Court's decision as a victory over the "corporate gun lobby." Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated that the decision "will save lives by keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people," and that "the Supreme Court rejected efforts by the corporate gun lobby to undermine federal gun laws, reaffirming that sensible laws can have a big impact while being consistent with the Second Amendment." Adam Winkler, writing for "New Republic", also supported the ruling, stating that it is a "relief to law enforcement." However, others, like the National Rifle Association (NRA), criticized the ruling, stating that it "seemingly allows the government to require virtually any information it wants from a person buying a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, whether or not that information has any relationship to public safety or the policies of federal law." John Lott, a gun rights advocate, criticized the Court's statement that collecting this "information helps to fight serious crime," claiming that registration doesn't help solve crimes, since registered guns are rarely left at the scene. He noted, for example, that Hawaii's requirement to register guns hasn't solved a single crime in 50 years, though Lott cited no evidence to support his claim. According to Lott, the Court "confirmed a horrible injustice, with no understanding of how gun tracing works, and without producing any increased safety for Americans." A "Harvard Law Review" case note contended that, as a matter of law, the word ""person"" was properly interpreted by the majority, thus avoiding "gutting key provisions of the statute," and argued, against the dissent, that the majority's interpretation is also consistent with common English. However, the case note argued that a narrower reading of the second count was more appropriate, because the statute explicitly requires the name age and residence, and not anything else. Thus, the law review concluded, the Supreme Court established an unnecessary precedent.

Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society

The Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society was set up in 1894 by Edith Bright, Lydia Allen Booth and Nessie Stewart-Brown to promote the enfranchisement of women. The society held its first meeting in a Liverpool temperance hall, with Millicent Fawcett, head of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), as its guest speaker. The society set up headquarters in Lord Street. The group became affiliated with the NUWSS in 1898, it held meetings in cafés which included talks, poetry and dance recitals. Members were recruited from prominent members of society and they distanced themselves from working class suffrage societies such as Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).

Eleanor Rathbone led the society as its secretary from 1897, especially in campaigning in the 1910 elections. Three campaign shops were opened around Liverpool, asking men to vote for candidates who supported votes for women, especially Alexander Gordon Cameron. In 1911, Rathbone and Stewart-Brown set up a branch of the society to educate women who would soon get the vote. When the society disagreed with the NUWSS, it merged with the Municipal Women's Association to create the Liverpool Women's Citizens Association in 1919.

The Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society was set up in 1894 at a meeting in January at the temperance hall in Hardman Street. A society had been proposed a month earlier by Emily Hornby at a public meeting and after a unanimous vote, was founded by Edith Allan Bright, Lydia Allen Booth and Nessie Stewart-Brown and initially had twenty four members. The society set up headquarters at 6 Lord Street. Millicent Fawcett, leader of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, attended the first meeting as a guest speaker.

The society distinguished itself from the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and the Independent Labour Party, and became known as respectable "lady suffragists" as opposed to the more militant suffragettes. The society recruited more prestigious members of society, leading to other disenfranchised women (especially those from the working-class) joining the WSPU; the organisation also actively distanced itself from WSPU protests. By the first annual general meeting, on 11 January 1895, the membership had expanded to just 71.

In 1896, the society affiliated with Central National Society for Women's Suffrage, and by 1898 had joined the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Bright invited Christabel Pankhurst to speak in Liverpool on 12 February 1909, which resulted in a "phenomenal demand for membership cards". Pankhurst stayed at Bright's house whilst in the city.

Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society was formed with the intention of fulfilling a number of goals. It hoped to educate women on why they should have the right to vote and convince men of the same. It had links with Liberal MPs and intended to use these to pressure the government to allow women's suffrage. In addition, the society tried to drum up support for their cause by holding small scale events, often with speakers at the Yamen Cafe in Liverpool's Bond Street. The events would also include poetry, singing or performances of acting or ballet by the Blue Bird Theatre Company.

The society would take part in wider suffrage demonstrations, for example in June 1908, it supported a National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies event in London's Hyde Park and in June 1910 an event by all the Liverpool suffrage organinsations at Liverpool's St Georges Hall Eleanor Rathbone lead the society's campaigning in the 1910 Liverpool elections, opening campaign shops on Smithdown Road, Bold Street and Stanley Road, asking men to vote for anyone who would support votes for women, regardles of party. They actively campaigned for the Labour candidate Alexander Gordon Cameron, although he did not win.

The society was founded by three women. Edith Bright served on the executive committee of Liverpool Ladies Union of Workers among Women and Girls. She was involved in other feminist causes such as Mothers Union & National Union of Women Workers and was a driving force for a Liverpool branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Her husband, Allen Bright, was a lawyer, shipping merchant & Liberal MP. Lydia Allen Booth (née Butler) was an American who was on the executive committee of Liverpool Ladies Union of Workers among Women and Girls. Nessie Stewart-Brown was president of Liverpool Women's Liberal Association, and worked with Bright in the Mothers Union & National Union of Women Workers.


In 1911, sensing they were close to achieving suffrage, Rathbone & Stewart-Brown created Municipal Women's Association as a branch of the society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women voters and teaching women what to do when they had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women Suffrage Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's Suffrage Societies was taking, with its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the national emergency and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.

Espanto IV and V

Brothers Espanto IV and Espanto V (Spanish for "Terror 4"/"Scare 4" and "Terror 5"/"Scare 5") are a Mexican professional wrestling tag team who has worked primarily as a "rudo" (term used for wrestlers who portray the "Bad guys") team on the Mexican independent circuit. While both brothers have been unmasked in the ring no documentation of their birth names have been found.

They are the sons of professional wrestler Miguel Vázquez Bernal, better known as Espanto III and adopted the "Espantos" name and mask eight years after their father retired from wrestling. Their uncle Jose Eusebio Vázquez was also a wrestler, better known as Espanto I but was killed in 1968. Espanto IV retired in 2001 and Espanto V is semi-retired, working only the occasional show around his hometown of Torreon, Coahuila.

The wrestlers known as "Espanto IV" (Spanish for "Terror 4" or "Scare 4") and Espanto V ("Terror 5"/ "Scare 5") were both born and raised in Torreon, Coahuila, Mexico sons of Miguel Vázquez Bernal, better known by his ring name, Espanto III. As Espanto III, Vázquez was an active wrestler from the 1960s through the early 1980s. In a 1996 interview Espanto IV revealed that their father never pushed them to become wrestlers, insisting that they learn a trade as well as train for wrestling to make sure they had options in life. Espanto IV also shared the fact that it took a lot of convincing from the brothers to allow them to be known as "Espanto IV" and "Espanto V", but the fact that Vázquez and Fernando Cisneros Carrilo (Espanto II) had given Jesús Andrade Salas permission to work as Espanto Jr. finally convinced their father to allow them to become "Espanto IV" and "Espanto V" instead of being a "Junior" or "hijo" ("son").

In 1989 Espanto IV and Espanto V made their in ring debut, both wearing the distinctive black mask with a white cross of the original "Los Espantos". and soon verified that they were legitimately the sons of Espanto III, not "storyline" relatives or wrestlers who paid to use the ring name of a famous wrestler. Due to the secretive nature of masked wrestlers in Mexico, it is unclear if Espanto IV and V's 1989 debut was their "true" debut or if the brothers actually made their in-ring debut prior to 1989 using other masks and names to gain experience. The two worked regularly as a tag team in and around the Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico area under the names "Los Espantos" or "Los Nuevo Espantos" and would work for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) among others. The brothers later toured Japan, working for the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation and Michinoku Pro. In Japan they unsuccessfully challenged the Great Sasuke and Gran Hamada for the UWA/UWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship on April 19, 1993. They also appeared on the Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) Fourth Anniversary Show, teaming up with Super Delfin, where they lost to the Great Sasuke, Kendo and Choden Senshi Battle Ranger.

On April 20, 1997, Espanto VI and Espanto V lost a "Luchas de Apuestas", or "bet match", to the team of Takeda and Maravilloso. As a result of the loss Espanto IV and V were both forced to take their mask off in the middle of the ring. While they unmasked and revealed their birth names, no record of their actual names have been found. The duo was later involved in controversy as they lost their masks twice more in "Luchas de Apuestas" matches, the second time to the team of Blue Fish and Mongol Chino in Monterrey and then a third time to the brother-team of Stuka and Stuka Jr. in Gomez Palacio, Durango. "Lucha libre" has strong rules in place around "Luchas de Apuestas" matches that normally does not allow wrestlers to wear their mask again after losing a "Lucha de Apuestas" match. In the pre-internet days wrestling results from the independent circuit was often not reported outside of the state, allowing Espanto IV and Espanto V to lose their masks three times in a short period of time without the various wrestling commissions or fans being aware of this. Over time wrestling commissions in the different states did discover the blatant violation of their rules and the state of Nuevo Leon barred them from wrestling there for two years for the infraction.

In late 1999 Espanto IV and V both competed in a three-way "Lucha de Apuestas" match against Aguila Roja, with Espanto IV losing to Aguila Roja and thus was forced to have all his hair shaved off after the match. By 2001 Espanto IV worked less and less, either retiring from wrestling or adopting a new masked identity that has not been revealed. On December 25, 2006, Espanto V was one of elevent wrestlers who put their mask or hair on the line in a steel cage match; others included Hijo del Soberano, Brillante, Ángel Azteca Jr., Moro III, Súper Leopardo, Depredador, Semental, Dorado Jr. and Máquina 27. Espanto V escaped the cage before the end of the match and kept his hair safe for the night. In 2007 Espanto V gained a small measure of revenge on behalf of Espanto IV as he defeated Stuka in a "Lucha de Apuestas" match, forcing Stuka to be shaved bald. On September 12, 2010 Espanto V teamed up with "Exótico" Sexy Francis for a "Ruleta de la Muerte" ("Roulette of Death") tournament, losing to the teams of Crazy Daisy and Dulce Paola, Pimpinela Escarlata and Sexy Libra, Sexy Piscis and V-57. Because of the loss, the two were forced to fight each other in a "Lucha de Apuestas" match, which Espanto V won. After the match, Sexy Francis was forced to have his hair shaved off as a result.

Mersea Fort

Mersea Fort, also known as Cudmore Grove Blockhouse, was an artillery fort established by Henry VIII on the East Mersea coast in 1543. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the River Colne that led to the town of Colchester. It was triangular in shape, with earthwork walls and three bastions to hold artillery. It was demobilised in 1552, but was brought back into use several times over the next century and saw service during the Second English Civil War of 1648. The fort hosted an admiralty court to oversea the local oyster trade, until the dilapidation of the site forced the court to move to the Moot Hall in Colchester in the middle of the 18th century. A new gun battery was built at the fort during the Napoleonic Wars, but the fortification then fell into decline and was extensively damaged by the construction of a sea wall along the coast. The remains of the earthworks were excavated by archaeologists between 2002 and 2003.

Mersea Fort was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were limited in scale.
In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III over the annulment of his long-standing marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, who took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a "device", in 1539, giving instructions for the "defence of the realm in time of invasion" and the construction of forts along the English coastline.

The county of Essex was not a priority for new investment, but the town of Harwich was reinforced in 1539 and further new fortifications, including Mersea Fort, were built along the coast in 1543, under the direction of Richard Lee and Richard Cawarden, at an estimated total cost of £2,717. The fort was positioned on salt marshland on the south side of the River Colne, and would have protected the entrance to the estuary, working together with the new blockhouses built at St Osyth and Brightlingsea. Mersea was triangular, with earthwork walls between approximately long, further protected by "maunds", round baskets filled with earth, and a defensive ditch with a drawbridge. On each of the three corners was a circular bastion housing up to four guns. Buildings in the courtyard would have housed the garrison, which comprised a captain, a lieutenant, two soldiers, a porter and between three and six artillery gunners. There was a nearby jetty, probably for use by the fort.

In 1552 the fort was decommissioned, but was subsequently recommissioned by Mary I. In addition to the fort's military role, it hosted a court to oversee the oysterfields along the East Mersea coast, which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing. In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern the oyster trade, which were enforced by an admiralty court, held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority all the way up to the top of the estuary. A survey in 1586 showed the fort had been abandoned by the military once again: the defences were in a poor state, the guns' barrels were clogged with dirt and the site had been occupied by an elderly woman. It was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first the Spanish Armada and then the Dunkirker privateers.

During the First English Civil War between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament, Mersea Fort saw no action; after the victory of Parliament in 1646, the fort's garrison was demobilised. Conflict flared again in 1648 with the outbreak of the Second English Civil War, and Colchester was taken by the Royalists. The town was immediately besieged by General Thomas Fairfax, who quickly seized Mersea Fort, which controlled the supply route by river into Colchester, before the Royalists could do so. The fort had contained five pieces of artillery: two culverins, two sakers and one drake. A Royalist raiding party of 300 soldiers was sent to recapture the fort, but without success.

Mersea Fort was placed under the command of Captain William Burrell. Guns and ammunition were kept there in case of a fresh rebellion, with a garrison of 36 men, which was temporarily reinforced by an additional squadron of horsemen and 50 foot soldiers in July 1650. Repairs were made from 1651 onwards, and new accommodation was constructed for the fort's gunners. After an invasion scare in 1655, Mersea was temporarily used to imprison Royalists suspected of planning an insurgency against Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth government. The fort was then demobilised by Cromwell as part of his efforts to reduce defence costs; Burrell was ordered to dismantle the fort but the order was never carried out, partially because of the practical difficulties and because of opposition from the owner of the land. The admiralty court continued to be held in the fort, although it proved much harder to enforce the fishery rules because of the political turmoil.

By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery rules were reinforced by fresh legislation in 1758, which created a court of conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed to sit at the fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars at the start of the 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9 kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.

In the 21st century, the remains of the site are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument. The site was surveyed in 1982 and excavations were carried out between 2002 and 2003, analysing surviving timber structures that had been exposed by coastal erosion.

Kawan Bergeloet

Kawan Bergeloet (Perfected Spelling: Kawan Bergelut; Indonesian for "Playmate") is a collection of short stories written by Soeman Hs and first published by Balai Pustaka in 1941. It contains twelve stories, seven of which were previously published in the magazine "Pandji Poestaka", as well as an introduction by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana. These stories are generally humorous in nature, and presented with a diction that shows strong east Sumatran influences.

Released in response to the commercial success of collection "Teman Doedoek", "Kawan Bergeloet" has been reprinted several times and received positive critical appraisal. Soeman, together with Kasim, has since been considered a pioneer of the Indonesian short story. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw writes that the collection is Soeman's most interesting contribution to Indonesian literature.

Short stories and sketches in Malay have been recorded in Indonesia since the 1870s, and a short story collection—H. Kommer's "Warna Sari"—was published in 1912. These early stories used vernacular Malay and were often humorous or derived from fairy tales or detective fiction. Short story-writing developed further in the 1920s and 1930s, when short stories and sketches in a more formal register of Malay were widely published in such magazines as "Pandji Poestaka" and "Poedjangga Baroe". The first collection of short stories in the Indonesian literary canon, "Teman Doedoek", was published by Balai Pustaka in 1937. This collection was a commercial success, selling 4,000 copies by 1941.
"Teman Doedoek" was read by Soeman Hs, a Bengkalis-born teacher who had already gained popularity as a writer of detective fiction. Soeman, once a student of Kasim's, had also experimented with more humorous story-telling approaches, including in his novel "Pertjobaan Setia" as well as in the numerous short stories he had published through "Pandji Pustaka". After the commercial success of "Teman Doedoek", Balai Pustaka sought to release a new short story collection; thus, Soeman was contacted.

"Kawan Bergeloet" contains twelve short stories or sketches written by Soeman, seven of which had initially been written for and published in "Pandji Poestaka". The remaining stories were written especially for the new collection. The first edition included an article on Soeman, written by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, which had previously been published in the January 1936 issue of "Pedoman Pembatja". This has been excluded from some later reissues.

"Tjik Mat" (Perfected Spelling: "Cik Mat") follows a young man named Mat who goes fishing by the riverside. After three casts he is unable to catch any fish. On the fourth cast, he hooks a fish, but it falls into the waters. The story was first published in 1933, in issue 13, volume 11, of "Pandji Poestaka".

"Piloe" (Perfected Spelling: "Pilu", meaning "Melancholia"), follows a mother who goes to the port with her child, Mak Jam, to meet her husband Hajji Saleh. Upon arriving, Jam is unable to find him. A crewman later tells the mother that Saleh died three days before reaching Sabang. The story was first published in 1933, in issue 40, volume 11, of "Pandji Poestaka".

"Salah Paham" (meaning "Misunderstanding") follows Kari Boengsoe, a gambir merchant, who travels to Singapore after turning a tidy profit. When his escort leaves, Kari goes to a nearby restaurant for dinner. The waiter asks him, "Kari apa?", to which Kari replies that he wants to eat. This exchange is repeated several times until the waiter asks "Kari ajam? Kari kambing?" Kari and the waiter begin fighting, and the police are called. When they arrive, they realize the source of the confusion, explain it, and leave. Shortly afterwards, the incident is repeated when Kari and the waiter have a misunderstanding over an ice cube. According to Balai Pustaka, "Salah Paham" was previously published. However, Ernst Kratz, in his bibliography of literature published in Indonesian magazines, does not note any publication.

"Salah Sangka" (meaning "Mistaken Expectations") follows Malim Boengsoe, a respected man from a small village, who—having had four daughters—desperately wants a son. He prays continuously, and his wife becomes pregnant. Nine months later, when she begins labour, Malim is busy praying for a son. An escaped criminal sneaks into the room of Malim's wife, and she and the other women there scream out "Laki-laki! Laki-laki!" Malim praises God and goes to the room as the criminal escapes. When Malim arrives and asks for his son, he is confused, as there is no-one else there. The story was first published in 1933, in issue 59, volume 11, of "Pandji Poestaka".

"Pandai Djatoeh" (Perfected Spelling: "Pandai Jatuh", meaning "The Clever Falls") describes an incident involving three old men at a wedding. When the hosts pass out betel to be chewed, the first man takes out a golden mortar to crush the betel. He boasts that the only shortcoming of such a mortar was that the betel tasted somewhat sour. The second man then takes out his silver mortar and says that, with silver, the betel would only taste sour if left for too long. The third man, the poorest of them all, takes out his wooden mortar and says that, having tried golden and silver mortars, he has concluded that betel crushed under wood tastes the best of all. The story was first published in 1933, in issue 60, volume 11, of "Pandji Poestaka".

"Karena Hati" (meaning "Because of the Heart") follows a man who becomes an official in a small village. There, he marries Sitti Aminah, a young woman who, though only 20 years of age, has been married and divorced three times. Their marriage does not last long, and the man leaves Aminah three days before the Eid al-Fitr holiday. However, his expensive set of black clothing, which he must wear during the Eid ceremonies, is accidentally left at Aminah's home. Pretending to be sick, the man goes to Aminah and asks her to cover him with clothing and light a fire to keep him warm. When she starts a fire in the kitchen, the man escapes with his black clothes. The story was first published in 1936, in issues 100 and 101, volume 14, of "Pandji Poestaka".

"Fatwa Membawa Ketjewa" (Perfected Spelling: "Fatwa Membawa Kecewa", meaning "Preaching Brings Disappointment") follows a Lebai Saleh, a labourer and student of Islam who is known for being greedy and miserly and was once driven out of a village for offering an insultingly low bride price. When arriving in a new village, he is taken on as an Islamic teacher. In his sermons Saleh, hoping that his students will give him some goods, preaches the importance of charity. He is soon receiving chickens and fish, and has married a local woman. During a meal, Saleh again gives a sermon on charity, but he and his wife fight soon afterwards after she gives some bowls and plates to other women. Saleh's nature is revealed, and he is again forced to flee. The story was first published in 1938, in issues 93 and 94, volume 16, of "Pandji Poestaka".

"Itoelah Asalkoe Tobat" (Perfected Spelling: "Itulah Asalku Tobat", meaning "Thus Did I Repent") tells of Hajji Malik, a former criminal who became devoted to his prayers in his old age. A fellow villager goes to see Malik and asks why he abandoned his criminal ways and embraced Islam. Malik tells his visitor that, fifteen years previously, he and a friend were travelling through the forests when they saw some people burying a box. That night they dug up the box and tried to take it away, hoping it would be treasure. However, upon opening the box, they found it contained the body of a young child. They returned the box and Malik abandoned the life of a criminal. This story was written for "Kawan Bergeloet".

"Selimoet Bertoeah" (Perfected Spelling: "Selimut Bertuah", meaning "The Magical Blanket") follows Tji' Dang, a man who is terrified of his wife. During Ramadhan, he is sent to buy a blanket but, on the way home, a wayward cigar burns a hole in the blanket. Afraid of what his wife will say, Dang buys another blanket. The first blanket is given to Dang's stepson, Boejoeng. Later that week, Dang tries to break the fast early by stealing some biscuits. Rather than be found out by his stepson, Dang convinces Boejoeng to cover his head with his blanket. That evening Boejoeng, having seen Dang take the biscuits through the hole in the blanket, demands that his stepfather double his allowance or else he will reveal Dang's secret. This story was written for "Kawan Bergeloet".

"Salah Mengerti" (meaning "Misunderstanding") follows two young boys: an Indian boy from Madras and a Malay boy nicknamed Pengkar. While out selling their wares, Tambi and Pengkar begin fighting owing to their inability to understand each other. This begins with fighting over their sales cry. This is followed by an argument regarding holy basil and poison ivy which ends with the Indian boy rubbing the poison ivy against his buttocks out of contempt. According to Balai Pustaka, this story was written for "Kawan Bergeloet". However, Kratz records it as first being published in 1933, in issue 51, volume 11, of "Pandji Poestaka".

"Papan Reklame" (meaning "Billboards") follows two shopkeeper, a man and a woman, who compete to offer the lowest prices. Both open their shops within days of each other, and they continually undercut each other's prices to attract customers. This conflict reaches the point that one shopkeeper, Wan Saleh, decides to buy out his competitor at cost. She agrees, and Saleh sells these wares, advertising a 5% markup. When he hears that his competitor will go to Singapore to buy new wares, Saleh follows her. When they are on the ship, it is revealed that the shopkeepers are actually husband and wife, and that he had actually bought her stock out with a 10% markup; as such, the customers paid a total markup of 15%. This story was written for "Kawan Bergeloet".

"Kelakar Si Bogor" (meaning "The Antics of Bogor") follows the betting of a dockworker named Bogor. To introduce himself to some Arab sailors, he convinces them to bet on splitting purple mangosteens. After winning $4.50, Bogor reveals his secret: he has been reusing mangosteen skins to add to his count. Bogor returns the money, and the sailors leave. On another occasion, Bogor bets a young sailor that all of the thirty eggs his chicken has laid will hatch. When the sailor returns and finds thirty chicks, he is shocked, and gives Bogor $10. Bogor later reveals to his friend, the narrator, that only twenty eggs had hatched, and that he had purchased the other ten. This story was written for "Kawan Bergeloet".

The Indonesian literary scholar Ajip Rosidi writes that the vast majority of the stories in "Kawan Bergeloet" are meant as comedy. He considers only one story—"Piloe"—to have been intended as more serious or sad. Several of the stories use tropes previously seen in Kasim's "Teman Doedoek", such as conflict arising from a misunderstanding, and the contents of some other stories are similar.

For "Kawan Bergeloet", Soeman wrote in Indonesian, a language based on formal Malay. His diction and phrasing was strongly influenced by his east Sumatran background, with little influence from the language as spoken in Java. Rosidi considers his language to flow more easily than Kasim's. John Wolff, the author of "Indonesian Readings", sees Soeman as using "flourishes which echo folk-tale stories".

"Kawan Bergeloet" was published by Balai Pustaka in 1941, with the series number 1426. The collection's title, "Kawan Bergeloet", has variously been translated as "Playmates", "Comrades Wrestling", and "Argumentative Companions"; the word "bergeloet", in Indonesian, can mean either "to wrestle" or "to laugh". Rosidi, identifying "bergeloet" as meaning "to laugh", writes that the title was meant to indicate that the book was intended for entertainment purposes, to be read in one's spare time.

Soeman gained recognition as a pioneer of the Indonesian short story for "Kawan Bergeloet", and over subsequent decades was commonly mentioned with Kasim in histories of the literary form. The collection has been reissued several times. The third printing, in 1950, introduced an updated spelling as well as nine illustrations by "Nasjah". The most recent edition was published in 1997. The story "Papan Reklame" was reprinted in "Indonesian Readings", a student reader for Indonesian as a foreign language, in 1978.

Rosidi writes that Soeman's greatest strength in "Kawan Bergeloet" is in his description. He considers the writer to have avoided clichéd descriptions, instead using "new and original" descriptions, metaphors, and turns of phrase. Rosidi considers some of the stories' comic incidents to be overly complicated, but attributes this to Soeman's previous activity in the detective genre. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw finds the sketches in "Kawan Bergeloet" to be "well-observed and realistically described" and Soeman's most interesting contribution to Indonesian literature.

São Tomé and Príncipe at the 2016 Summer Olympics

São Tomé and Príncipe competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. The country's participation at Rio de Janeiro marked its sixth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics. Three athletes from São Tomé and Princípe were selected for the Games. Romário Leitão and Celma Bonfim da Graça participated in athletics and Buly Triste in flatwater canoeing. Bonfim was the only female on the roster and the only member with prior Olympic experience (from Beijing 2008). Triste was the first male athlete to carry the São Tomé and Princípe flag at the opening ceremony. São Tomé and Princípe has yet to win its first Olympic medal.

São Tomé and Príncipe participated in six Summer Olympics between its debut in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highest number of São Toméans to participate at any single Summer Games was three in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, later equalled in 2016. No São Toméan has ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics. São Tomé and Principe has also never participated at any Winter Olympics.

Both São Toméan participants in athletics qualified for the Games through universality slots while Buly Triste qualified via the 2016 African Sprint Qualifier in Pretoria, South Africa. Triste was chosen to be São Tomé and Princípe's flag bearer during the Parade of Nations of the opening ceremony.

São Tomé and Príncipe received universality slots from IAAF to send two athletes (one male and one female) to the Olympics. Romário Leitão made his Olympic debut by competing in the Men's 5000 m event while Celma Bonfim da Graça made her second Olympic appearance, with the first being in Beijing 2008. At the 2008 Olympics, she was one of three athletes to compete for São Tomé and Príncipe. She ran the 5000 metres, finishing 16th (and last) in her heat, still achieving a national record with the time of 17:25.99 minutes with a split time of 2:16.10 minutes behind Lucia Chandamale of Malawi. In these Olympics, Bonfim ran the women's 1500 metres event and finished 14th in her heat with a time of 4:38.86 minutes, failing to qualify for the semifinals. Leitão ran the men's 5000 metres and came 25th in his heat with a time of 15:53.32 minutes. He placed one ahead of Zouhair Aouad who did not finish, and did not qualify for the finals.

São Tomé and Príncipe qualified one boat in the men's C-1 1000 metres for the Olympics at the 2016 African Championships, signifying the nation's return to the sport after an eight-year hiatus. Buly Triste made his debut in the men's 1000 metres one-man covered canoe event. He came 6th and last in his heat with a time of 4:54.516 minutes. He automatically qualified to the semifinals, but did not reserve a position in any of the finals after coming 7th with a time of 4:46.396 minutes, coming 16 seconds behind Angel Kodinov of Bulgaria.

Mint (song)

"Mint" is a song recorded by Japanese singer Namie Amuro. It was released on May 18, 2016 in Japan and May 27, 2016 in Taiwan as a CD single, DVD single, and worldwide on May 18 as a digital download by Avex Trax, Avex Taiwan and Amuro's own label Dimension Point. It also served as Amuro's fifth non-album maxi single, after the release of her December 2015 single "Red Carpet", and features the B-side song "Chit Chat". The track was written by Andreas Oberg, Emyli, Maria Marcus, and Tiger, while production was handled by Oberg and Marcus.

Musically, "Mint" is a dance song that incorporates musical elements of contemporary R&B, EDM, and rock music. The lyrical content for both "Mint" and "Chit Chat" includes English and Japanese language, with the former discussing themes of lust and love. "Mint" received positive reviews from music critics. Some critics commended the production of the track, complimenting the composition and Amuro's vocal performance.

Commercially, the song performed moderately on the Oricon Singles Chart in Japan, reaching number four. However, it performed better on the Japan Hot 100, reaching number two and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for digital sales of 250,000 units. An accompanying music video was directed by Naokazu Mitsuishi, which displays Amuro and 30 female backup dancers in a dark-blue room. To promote the single, it was used as the theme song for the Japanese television drama series "Bokuno Yabai Tsuma" (translated to "My Sick Wife"). Alongside this, "Mint" will be included in the setlist for her 2016 Live Style concert tour in Japan.

After the release of Amuro's twelfth studio album "Genic" (2015), she started to release non-album maxi singles. The first entry was "Red Carpet", which was performed through her Asian-wide concert tour name Livegenic 2015–2016. Despite its performance, it did not appear on the live release "Livegenic 2015-2016". Then on March 31, music publication Jame World confirmed the release of a new single on May 18, which was revealed to be "Mint". It was confirmed on Amuro's website that "Mint" would be used as the official theme song to the Fuji TV Japanese television drama series "Bokuno Yabai Tsuma". The production team for the television series approached Amuro's record label, Dimension Point, to participate in recording a song for the show, which she approved. Regarding the song, Amuro commented; "I'm thankful to have received the offer to provide the theme song. It's a fast-paced, thrilling track told from a women's perspective. I'll be happy if this song captured the essence of the drama."

"Mint" was written by Andreas Oberg, Emyli, Maria Marcus, and Tiger, while production was handled by Oberg and Marcus; it was also composed by Oberg, Emyli, and Marcus. According to Amuro, she described the composition and production of the song as "thrilling". Musically, it is a dance song that incorporates musical elements of contemporary R&B, EDM, and rock music. Writing for "Entertainment Weekly", Joey Nolfi described "Mint" as a "a wonderfully whacky mix of electric, surf-rocking guitars, R&B chants, and a pulsating EDM breakdown,". A staff member at Tokyo Girls Update analysised the composition, and noted the use of "hard-hitting beats and some slithery guitar lines". A staff member from Japanese magazine "CD Journal" noted the musical element of grime in its composition. The lyrical content for both "Mint" and "Chit Chat" includes English and Japanese language.

Four weeks before its initial release on May 18, "Mint" had leaked fully online. The single was released in Japan and Taiwan as a CD single, DVD single, and as a digital EP by Avex Trax and Amuro's own label Dimension Point. All three editions included the normal versions and instrumentals of "Mint" and the B-side track "Chit Chat". "Chit Chat" was written by Andreas Oberg, Emyli, Maria Marcus, and Tiger, and was described by a "CD Journal" staff member as a "happy house" song. The bonus DVD included the music video of "Mint". On May 18, first press issues at CDJapan.com offered a B2-size poster of the CD artwork. The CD and digital artwork features a close-up of Amuro in a gold dress, whilst the CD and DVD bundle has a body shot with her holding a gold shoe.

Upon its release, "Mint" received positive reviews from music critics. A staff member at Tokyo Girls Update enjoyed the song, and felt that the instrumentation complimented Amuro's vocals well. Similarly, a member from "CD Journal" enjoyed the song's music, and praised how other musical genres such as electronic dance and grime music in the song complimented the overall J-pop influence. The reviewer also highlighted the B-side track "Chit Chat" as a good contribution to the maxi release. A Japanese reviewer from Amazon also commended the production and composition, labelling it as "memorable" and "impressive". "Entertainment Weekly" writer Joey Nolfi selected it amongst six other songs as one of his best tracks of Summer 2016. With this selection, he commented that the amount of musical genres such as EDM and R&B "showcas[es] the sonic bravura that makes J-Pop some of the most interesting music on the planet."

Commercially, "Mint" was a moderate success in Japan. The song debuted at number four on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling 28,136 units in its first week. Despite it being one of Amuro's lowest first week sales for a single in her career, the single marked 22 years of top ten singles released by Amuro, one of the only distinctions by any solo artist in Japan. It slipped to number 21 the following week, selling 5,245 units, one of Amuro's largest drops on the Oricon chart. By the end of May 2016, it was ranked at number 10 on their Monthly chart and sold 33,381 units. It spent nine weeks in the Top 200 chart, and sold 46,231 by October 2017.

Digitally, "Mint" and "Chit Chat" was a success in Japan. On the Japan Hot 100 chart, hosted by "Billboard", the former track entered at number 56 on the fourth week, whilst the latter entered at 48 on the final week of May 2016. During that same final week in May, "Mint" reached number four and the top spot on the "Billboard" Japan Singles Sales Chart, and the Billboard Japan Radio Songs chart. The following week, the single slipped to number five on the chart, and fell outside the top 10 during its seventh week. In June 2016, "Mint" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for digital sales of 100,000 units; this is her first certification since her 2014 single "Brighter Day".

An accompanying music video was directed by Naokazu Mitsuishi. It opens with a long shot of Amuro and 30-plus female backup dancers in a dark-lit blue room. During the first verse and pre-chorus, Amuro is seen walking around the dancers and sings the song. Once the chorus starts, Amuro takes of her cape and dances in a small suit, along with the dancers. Inter cut scenes feature Amuro on a large platform with a long pink dress and flower crown, singing the track in a further distance between her and the dancers. The video received positive reviews from publications, including a critique by Arama Japan, who labelled it "simple" yet "stylish" and "impressive". To promote the single, "Mint" was used as the theme song for the Japanese television drama series "Bokuno Yabai Tsuma" (translated to "My Sick Wife"). Alongside this, "Mint" will be included in the setlist for her 2016 Live Style concert tour, to be held in Japan.

Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter

Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter (stylized as "Aliens Ate My Babysitter!") is a side-scrolling platform video game developed by id Software and published by FormGen in December 1991 for DOS. It is the seventh episode of the "Commander Keen" series, though it is numbered as the sixth, as "Commander Keen in Keen Dreams" is outside of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he journeys through an alien world to rescue his kidnapped babysitter. The game feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.

After the success of the three-episode "Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons", the developers of the game, including programmers John Carmack and John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack, left their jobs at Softdisk to found id Software. After making a prototype game in "Dreams" to develop new ideas such as gameplay changes, graphical enhancements like parallax scrolling, and artistic improvements, the team worked on making a sequel trilogy of episodes from June to December 1991. During development the last episode was split off to be released as a stand-alone game due to a deal made by id's new president, Mark Rein, with the remaining two episodes produced as a pair titled "Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy" instead. "Aliens", despite being released as the sixth main episode in the series, was developed before the fifth. It did not sell as well as the first trilogy, which was attributed by id to poor marketing and its awkward status as a stand-alone retail game in a series known for groups of shareware episodes. Although another "Keen" game was planned, during development id Software began work on "Wolfenstein 3D", and its success, along with the development of "Doom", led id to not develop any further "Keen" games.

"Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter" is a side-scrolling platform video game: the majority of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above. Some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Keen can also grab onto the edge of platforms and pull himself up. There are giant switches which must be jumped up into or dropped onto to flip which have effects on the gameworld, such as retracting and extending gates or initiate moving platforms. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though the player can save their game at any point. Between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed, while portions of the map are gated off until specific levels are completed.

The game contains a variety of enemies in the levels, which the player must stun or avoid; these are primarily different alien creatures. Levels can also include hazards, such as dart traps or fire; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. "Aliens" has three difficulty settings, which change the number and types of enemies present. It features a stun gun that knocks out most enemies permanently using ammo found throughout the game. Different enemies take differing numbers of shots to knock out, or, in some cases, are immune. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also small fly-like creatures which award an extra life for every 100 collected, colored keycard gems which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life.

Despite being the sixth episode in the series, "Aliens" is not clearly stated to take place after the events of the pair of episodes in "Galaxy". In the game's introduction, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze is working on his wrist computer in his backyard clubhouse when his babysitter, Molly McMire, calls him in for dinner. Upon hearing a loud noise he rushes out, only to discover her missing and a note burnt into the grass stating that the Bloogs of Fribbulus Xax have taken Molly and plan to eat her; donning his helmet as Commander Keen, Billy rushes off to save her before his parents get home. During the game, Keen journeys through the various outposts, factories, and installations of the alien Bloogs on the planet of Fribbulus Xax as well as a space station above it.

After Keen finds Molly tied up at the back of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she explains to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the "Vorticon" trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to blow up the entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the "Galaxy". The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.

In October—December 1990, a team of employees from programming studio Softdisk, calling themselves Ideas from the Deep, developed the three-part video game "Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons". The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana developing games for the "Gamer's Edge" video game subscription service and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of "Vorticons" in December, and the arrival of the first US$10,500 royalty check from shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team quit Softdisk and started their own company, id Software. As part of the settlement with Softdisk—made because the team had created the game on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends—they agreed to make a series of games for Softdisk's Gamer's Edge subscription service. As the team began to explore creating another set of "Commander Keen" games, they made a prototype game for Softdisk, "Commander Keen in Keen Dreams", to fulfill their obligations while also helping improve the next full set of "Keen" games.

For "Vorticons", John Carmack and Romero focused exclusively on the programming, while Adrian Carmack joined late in development and had a personal art style that did not match with the game. As a result, the game was largely shaped by designer Tom Hall's personal experiences and interests. Keen's red sneakers and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud's psychological theories, such as that of the id. The team reprised their roles for subsequent "Keen" games, with the addition of programmer Jason Blochowiak for "Galaxy" and "Aliens", and changed the game engine and design for the next "Keen" games: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The level maps were designed using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which was first created for "Dangerous Dave" and was used for the entire "Keen" series as well as several other games.
For "Vorticons", Carmack had created adaptive tile refresh to produce a scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For "Galaxy" and "Aliens", he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, he came up with a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be. Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in "Vorticons" left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in "Dreams" replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for "Galaxy", came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies, which appeared in all three episodes made in 1991. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior "Keen" games, was added to "Aliens", composed by Bobby Prince.

In June 1991, with "Dreams" completed, the id team began working on another trilogy of "Commander Keen" episodes. The game, episodes four though six, was intended to be published in the same manner as the first one: released through Apogee, with episode four released for free in order to spur interest in purchasing the other two episodes. By August they had completed a beta version of episode four, "Secret of the Oracle", and Romero sent it off to a fan he had met from Canada, Mark Rein, who had offered to play-test the game. Romero was impressed with the list of bugs that Rein sent back, as well as with his business sense, and proposed bringing him in to the company as a probationary president for six months in order to help expand their business. Within a few weeks of being hired, Rein made a deal to get id into the commercial market: to take the sixth episode and make it a stand-alone game, published as a retail title through FormGen instead of part of a shareware trilogy. They signed the deal, but Scott Miller of Apogee was dismayed; he felt that not having a full trilogy for the shareware game would hurt sales.

Also in August 1991, the team moved from Shreveport to Hall's hometown of Madison, Wisconsin, leaving behind Wilbur, who was unwilling to leave a stable job at Softdisk to fully join in with the startup, but picking up programmer Jason Blochowiak, who was working at the time at Softdisk and living at the same house as John Carmack and Wilbur. Once there, the team worked out of a three-bedroom apartment, with John Carmack living in one of the bedrooms. There, they worked on the two episodes of "Galaxy", their remaining Softdisk games, and the sixth episode, "Aliens", between August and December. As it grew colder, they increasingly spent all of their time in the apartment, making the games, and designing a game that would later become "Wolfenstein 3D". As "Aliens" had a different publisher and schedule than "Galaxy", it was released as the sixth episode of the series but was actually developed prior to the fifth, "The Armageddon Machine".

"Aliens" did not sell as well as hoped for by id, which the team partially blamed on what they felt was terrible box art produced by a company that had previously designed packaging for Lipton tea. According to John Carmack, the CGA version of the game wasn't very popular. Despite this, the sales were strong enough that id agreed to use FormGen as the publisher for their next retail title, the "Spear of Destiny" episode of "Wolfenstein 3D". A description of the shareware market in the first issue of "PC Zone" in 1993 noted that "Aliens", as it was also sold through shareware distributors like Apogee, was one of the most popular games of 1993 in the shareware market. A short review in the same issue as part of a listing of shareware games that could be ordered through the magazine called "Aliens" the "special edition" of the series and "the best one yet". The game won the "Best Entertainment Program" and "Best Overall Program" categories at the 1992 Shareware Industry Awards. A review of the entire "Commander Keen" series in 1993 by Sandy Petersen in the first "Eye of the Monitor" column for "Dragon" described the series as action games with "hilarious graphics". Acknowledging its debt to "Super Mario Bros.", he called it, especially "Galaxy" and "Aliens", "one of the best games of its type". He also praised that it was not "mindlessly hard", instead requiring some thought to play through, and especially noted the humor in the graphics and gameplay.

After "Aliens", id Software did not produce any more games in the "Commander Keen" series besides the co-developed "Galaxy". Another trilogy of episodes, titled "The Universe Is Toast", was planned for December 1992, but was cancelled after the success of id's "Wolfenstein 3D" and development focus on "Doom". A final "Keen" game, "Commander Keen", was developed for the Game Boy Color in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by Activision. "Aliens" was included with the other id-developed series games in the 1996 "id Anthology" compilation release, but as the game had not been published through Apogee, it was not included in the 1998 Apogee "Commander Keen" compilation release, or the 2014 "3D Realms Anthology" release.

Gumball (video game)

Gumball is a 1983 video game written for the Apple II by Robert Cook (now Veda Hlubinka-Cook) and published by Broderbund. It was ported to the Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. The player controls the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color.

Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept and Cook added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. The game contains a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release. Reviewers separately noted the difficulty of the game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work.

"Gumball" is an action video game in which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet by the end of the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.

The game requires a color television or monitor, and optionally works with a joystick or paddle controller.

Veda Hlubinka-Cook, then Robert Cook, wrote "Gumball" for publication by Broderbund in 1983. Broderbund had a reputation as a successful publisher. Its games and productivity software each composed about half of the company's output, and their software in both categories reached the top of the sales charts. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived the core concept of a machine that sorts based on color, and Veda Hlubinka-Cook expanded the concept with the gumball conceit. She spent a week designing the main processing machine, with its pipes and valves. Though she later returned to add more background detail, the original pipe design did not change. Most of Cook's time was spent programming the game's functions, such as the how individual gumballs move through the pipes.

To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. She iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded "Gumball" title page and the animated transitions between levels.

By this point, the company had printed the game's packaging—boxes, labels, and documentation—such that they were ready to ship after receiving the approval from game testers. The game debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show.

In 2016, an Apple II software cracker team found an Easter egg hidden by the game's creator 33 years prior. Cook had hidden a secret congratulations screen in the game for players who entered a specific keyboard key combination at a specific time and solved the resulting series of substitution ciphered clues. Cook congratulated the cracker team on Twitter. The crackers found the secret while working to preserve the game for the Internet Archive by removing its digital copyright protections. One of the crackers said that while most 1980s games could be cracked by automation, "Gumball" protections, coded by Roland Gustafsson, were exceptional.

Chris Browning of the Eugene, Oregon-based "Atari Computer Enthusiasts" wrote that "Gumball" was a good interlude between shoot-em-up games, but found that he lost interest when tasked with sorting four or more colors of gumballs. "Compute!'s Gazette" thought that "Gumball" was fun, and highlighted its "comical" elements, such as the factory manager emptying the player's bin when the player incorrectly sorts the wrong color into it. The magazine described "Gumball" as a "strategy-action" game and considered it a useful aid in developing faculties of logic and hand-eye coordination. David Hunter of "Softalk" asked whether the game was satirical commentary "on the Great American Dream of climbing the corporate ladder" depending on whether the factory work inculcated "good work habits" or "Disney-esque automatons". He wrote that the game had what corporate trainers would want: an introduction to repetitive tasks and a sense of nervous energy. Three decades later, Jason Koebler of "Motherboard" summarized that the game never became popular and that copies of it became rare.

Moog for Love

Moog for Love is the seventh extended play recorded by British electronic music duo Disclosure, consisting of brothers Howard and Guy Lawrence. The three-track record was released on 15 June 2016, by the labels Island and PMR Records. 2016 was a year where the duo were developing their skills of writing material while on the road. Its title is named after the 1952 Eddie Jefferson song "Moody's Mood for Love". They did not have enough material to produce a full-length album, but wanted to have a record released for the summer of that year regardless. Featuring collaborations with Eats Everything and Al Green, the album garnered generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics, some calling it a significant improvement over the duo's second studio LP "Caracal" (2015). Upon its release, the album landed at number 80 on the Australian Singles Chart.

In 2016, Disclosure had developed their skills of writing songs while on tour, but did not have time to produce enough material for a full-length album. Regardless, the duo wanted to release a record for the summer, reasoning that they felt "strange" not issuing any material to the public in that season. Therefore, they created and distributed a three-track "clubby" extended play that went "back to the start." "Moog for Love" was Disclosure's first record not to feature writing contributions from Jimmy Napes, which Howard said also "feels quite strange." With the EP, Disclosure wanted to use more different track development formulas from what they used for making their previous records, "Settle" (2013) and "Caracal" (2015), reasoning that they would be making the same music over and over again if they kept making tracks the same way. However, they still had made songs in one similar way they did for "Settle", in that there was some material only one of the members would work on, and after the song was finished, both members of the duo would decide if the track was ready for release and inclusion on the album.

"Moog for Love"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s opening cut, "Boss", written and arranged in a Los Angeles hotel room for a few days while on the road before being mixed and mastered at home, was the only song on the EP where Disclosure worked on a track together. Driven by a harsh drum loop, the song features singing from Howard Lawrence, his vocal track pitch-shifted down and filtered with EQing effects. The second track on the EP, "Feel Like I Do", is a remix of Al Green's 1972 song "I'm Still in Love with You". Guy found the song while listening to a batch of vinyl records, and when Disclosure asked Green and the track's label permission for use of samples of his recording, Green and the label enjoyed the track the duo had worked on and gave them multitrack stems of the original song for a much cleaner sound of the samples in the track. While the vocals are sped up in "Feel Like I Do," the strings, horns and electric guitar from Green's recording remain, with the addition electronic drums and "hazy effects" as "Rolling Stone" described. "Feel Like I Do" is the only track to not resemble the sound that was on "Settle" due to its slow tempo and feel.

The closing tropical house title track of "Moog for Love" was analyzed by a "NME" reviewer to borrow the rich sound that dominated "Caracal" while having the same tempo that was used for most tracks on "Settle". He also noted that the elements of UK garage and house in "Boss" and the title song are similar to those present on tracks from "Settle" such as "When a Fire Starts to Burn". Instrumented with "warbled" synthesizers and a pounding bass drum, the song ends with a "hypnotising" sample of the track "Moody's Mood", sung and recorded by Brian McKnight. "Moody's Mood" is a cover of what the EP and its title track is named after, "Moody's Mood for Love". A song by Eddie Jefferson, its melody is derived from an improvised solo by jazz saxophonist James Moody. An a cappella group had written lyrics for the melody, and in the recording being sampled by the track, McKnight sings the melody and lyrics. The bassline in the track is also generated by a moog synthesizer.

On 11 June 2016, Disclosure premiered "Boss" at the United Kingdom Wildlife Festival, leading to an estatic reception from the audience according to "NME". On 14 June 2016, "Moog for Love" had a "World Record" premiere on Zane Lowe's Apple Music show Beats 1. Both songs became "Annie Mac"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Hottest Record In The World" for 15 June. First available for streaming 14 June 2016, PMR and Island Records released "Moog for Love" for digital download the next day. The EP garnered generally positive reviews upon its distribution, some reviewers calling it significantly better than "Caracal". Praising it as a less "grown-up" dance release than "Caracal", Lary Bartleet of "NME" wrote that with "Moog for Love", "Disclosure are back in the club, where they belong, but… better."

"Wired" magazine called "Moog for Love" one of the "6 New Albums We Demand You Listen to Immediately" only for "Feel Like I Do", calling the song "the best Avalanches song the Avalanches didn’t make—and the top-down, sun-kissed track you need in your life right now." Rebecca Haithcoat, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, had a more mixed opinion, writing that while the release garners much of the same excitements as the "expert blend of sleek pop and those big, warm and happy belted house hooks of the ‘90s" that was on "Settle", it was, much like "Caracal", not as good as Disclosure's debut given that it was "uninspired" and that none of the songs on the EP were "immediate or necessary." Kyle Forward of "DIY" magazine was also disappointed with the EP, writing that the songs were only "reminders" of their old sound rather than being something much more than "indistinct nothingness" in addition to their previous sound.

All tracks written, mixed, and produced by Guy Lawrence, and mastered by Lewis Hopkin; additional writing and production credits are noted.

Voodoo (Oh Land song)

"Voodoo" is a song by Danish singer-songwriter Oh Land from her second studio album "Oh Land" (2011). It was released digitally as the album's third single on 1 April 2011 by Fake Diamond Records and A:larm Music, exclusively in the United Kingdom. Nanna Øland Fabricius wrote the track in collaboration with its producer Dan Carey. A synth-pop song, it features spoken verses and a repetitive refrain where she sings "it's voodoo you do".

The single received a mixed reception from music critics who highlighted her genre combinations but downplayed the lyrics. A music video was not created for the single, but the singer performed it live on several occasions, like at the Heaven nightclub in London in February 2012. The performance was compared to ones by both Rihanna and Robyn.

"Voodoo" is from Oh Land's second studio and first major-label album, "Oh Land" (2011). The record's third single overall, "Voodoo" was released as a digital download on 1 April 2011 by Fake Diamonds Records and A:larm Music. The download was made available exclusively in the United Kingdom and features the album version of "Voodoo". The song was written by both Oh Land and Dan Carey; the latter musician also solely produced "Voodoo". It was recorded in 2010 at Carey's home studios in Streatham while mixing occurred at Metropolis Studios in London.

"Voodoo" is a synth-pop song that lasts two minutes and fifty-one seconds. According to AllMusic's Andrew Leahey, the composition consists of Oh Land "layering spoken word verses over disco beats". Kim Skotte from "Politiken" felt the song was close to resembling teen pop music, whereas a critic for "Billboard" described it as a "quickie synth-pop" track. During the chorus, Oh Land repeats the same line consisting of "It's voodoo you do". John Calvert from "Drowned in Sound" jokingly suggested that the refrain originated from Reeves and Mortimer's comedy acts.

"Voodoo" divided music critics. Michael Jose Gonzalez, a writer for "Gaffa", was appreciative that the singer chose not to follow the trends in the music industry and described the song as irresistible pop. Leahey from AllMusic felt that Oh Land's combination of spoken verses and disco worked together well. However, Sal Cinquemani from "Slant Magazine" found the track to be generic: "while a song like 'Voodoo' could break Oh Land to a wider pop audience, it isn’t anything Little Boots or La Roux aren’t already doing." Several reviewers were more critical of the song's lyrics. "Drowned in Sound"s John Calvert called the "vocal hook [among] the year's most irksome". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music predicted that the refrain was bound "to get under a lot more skins that it is welcome to"; he also said that it "treads the same line between inspired and irritating as Marina and the Diamonds".

A music video for "Voodoo" was not created, but Oh Land has performed the song on several occasions, including at the Heaven nightclub in London in February 2012. During the event she sang every song from "Oh Land" with the exception of "Helicopter". The performance was compared to similar ones by Rihanna, but Tyler Kieron from The Arts Desk insisted that it was more along the lines of Robyn.

Bang Bang (Green Day song)

"Bang Bang" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day, released as the lead single from their twelfth studio album, "Revolution Radio" (2016), on August 11, 2016. Regarded as combining elements of the band's early punk rock days with themes from their politically motivated later albums, the song was inspired by the events of mass shootings in the United States and is written from the viewpoint of a mass shooter.

The single's music video was released on September 13, 2016, showcasing a trio, with masks of the band members' faces, robbing a bank, and then attending a Green Day house party. The song received positive critical reception, peaking at number one on the US Mainstream Rock, Alternative Songs, Rock Airplay, Canada Rock, and the UK Rock charts, as well as multiple international charts.

Billie Joe Armstrong started testing and recording material in Otis, the studio he built in Oakland, California, in 2014. The first song he composed turned out to be "Bang Bang". Self-described as "the most aggressive single we've ever had", it is written from the point of view of a mass shooter. According to Armstrong, the song is about "the culture of mass shooting that happens in America mixed with narcissistic social media". Armstrong feels that because incidents of society's rage are now being recorded by everyone, people surveil themselves which he feels is "so twisted".

The song is described by critics as reminiscent of Green Day's early pop punk and punk rock days of "39/Smooth" (1990), "Kerplunk!" (1992), and "Dookie" (1994), with hints of "American Idiot" (2004) and "21st Century Breakdown" (2009). "Bang Bang" is considered a combination of the "'90s Green Day sound and the 2000s Green Day lyrics". It was described as reflecting the state of confusion in today's world while one tries to figure out their position in the chaos. Armstrong has noted that this has been "a big theme through all of Green Day's history" – the state of "feeling lost".

"Bang Bang" was released on August 11, 2016, via digital download as the lead single from their forthcoming studio album, "Revolution Radio" (2016). The band also released the single's official lyric video on August 12, which had been viewed over two million times by August 17. It was noted the lyric video was inspired by recent incidents of mass shootings in the US. On August 28, the band announced on its website that the single would be released on CD for sale exclusively at Best Buy in the US only, and would include a live version of "Letterbomb" (2004) as the B-side. A music video was released for the song on September 13, 2016.

The music video for "Bang Bang" was released on September 13, 2016. Inspired by the rise in gun violence in the US, it depicts a trio of criminals, wearing face masks of Green Day's members, robbing a bank during the first half. These scenes are intercut with footage of the band performing amidst a house party. During the second verse, the criminals flee the bank and remove their masks, revealing themselves as two young women and a young man, before driving off in a Jeep, eventually arriving at the house party where Green Day is playing. During the bridge and final chorus, the robbers make their way through the crowd and approach the band, before tossing money from the robbery into the air as the video fades out. The blonde woman of the three criminals, who disguises herself as bassist Mike Dirnt, is portrayed by Ukrainian actress Ivanna Sakhno. Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong, who directed the video, also makes a cameo appearance as a punk during the song's bridge.

It is Green Day's first video since "21st Century Breakdown" not to feature Jason White performing with the band, as he dropped from his role as an official member earlier in the year.

"Bang Bang" received a positive reception from critics on its release. "Gigwise" praised it saying: "The song is Green Day at their punky best. It's far more in line with the intensity of stuff on "Dookie" than the ballads on "American Idiot"". Thomas Smith at "NME" observed: "Musically, it's classic Green Day; limited power chords used to furious effect, a maelstrom of abrasive punk rock that's aided by Mike Dirnt's rumbling bass and Tré Cool's on-point drumming. On this evidence, Green Day have found a way to stay relevant." Joseph R. Atilano, of Inquirer.net, concurred and said the song "does not sound 'glossy', 'too clean cut around the edges' nor overly polished". He added that it "sounds aesthetically right," especially for those who "want to hear the 'Green Day of old' once more".

"Rolling Stone" described "Bang Bang" as the "fastest, [and] most aggressive song on the album". Craig Mclean for "Q" described the song as a "jolt of frantic, melodic hardcore", and further added that "it's an appropriate trailblazer for an album on which Armstrong again taps into the societal and political frustration". Maria Sherman of "Spin" felt the band is at "their heaviest" on the track and compared it to "American Idiot" saying it is "both insensitive and hits close to home". William Sutton of "PopMatters" commented that "Bang Bang" is "much better than most of their output since the release of "American Idiot"". However, he criticized the track for sounding too familiar and felt the band has done better.

The song debuted at number 16 on the US Alternative Songs chart, marking the band's 24th top 20 entry and, its fifth highest debut ever. "Bang Bang" was also the band's 31st entry on the chart, tying them with Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chili Peppers for third as the most charted artists in the history of the charts, behind Pearl Jam and U2 with 38 and 41 entries respectively. The single became their 10th number one on the chart, tying them with Foo Fighters for the third most number ones, behind Linkin Park with 11 and Red Hot Chili Peppers with 13. Green Day also became the fourth band in the history of the US Alternative Songs chart to reach the number one spot in three separate decades; the others being U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Foo Fighters.

"Bang Bang" debuted at number 17 on the US Mainstream Rock chart, their second highest debut, after "Oh Love" (2012) at number 13. The song reached number one three weeks after its release becoming Green Day's fastest leap to the number one position on the US Mainstream Rock chart, breaking the previous record of five weeks for "Know Your Enemy" (2009). It is tied with "The Day That Never Comes" (2008) by Metallica as the second-fastest song to reach the top of the chart, behind Foo Fighters' "Something from Nothing" (2014) which took two weeks. The song also debuted at number eight and peaked at number one on the US Rock Airplay chart.

It also reached number four on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and number eight on the Hot Rock Songs chart. "Bang Bang" also peaked at number one on the Canada Rock and UK Rock charts, and number two on the New Zealand Heatseekers chart. Along with charting on the Canadian Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, "Bang Bang" also appeared on charts in Belgium, Scotland, Australia, and Japan.

Telepathy (song)

"Telepathy" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Christina Aguilera for the 2016 Netflix musical drama series "The Get Down", included on the accompanying soundtrack of the same name. It features American musician Nile Rodgers, and was co-written by Sia Furler in collaboration with Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. The track was produced by Elliott Wheeler and "The Get Down" director, Baz Luhrmann. While it was available to download from the soundtrack upon its release, it was promoted in Italy to contemporary hit radio as a single on August 23, 2016. Various remixes were also released throughout the following month.

Musically, "Telepathy" is a disco track reminiscent of the genre in the 1970s, reflecting the theme of the TV series, which documents the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop in that era. Aguilera's strong vocals were praised by music critics, with one in particular comparing her falsetto melismas to the style of Mariah Carey. "Telepathy" became Aguilera's ninth and Rodgers' fourth number-one song on the US "Billboard" Dance Club Songs chart, respectively. As a thank you gift to her fans, radio, and DJs for playing the track and making it number-one on the chart, Aguilera self-produced a short, disco-themed music video for the song.

Composed and written by Sia Furler, Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, "Telepathy" is a song recorded by Christina Aguilera featuring Nile Rodgers for the accompanying soundtrack to the Netflix musical drama series "The Get Down" (2016). "The Get Down", directed by Australian Baz Luhrmann, is set in The Bronx in the late 1970s and chronicles the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop. Luhrmann, alongside Elliot Wheeler, produced "Telepathy", marking the second time he and Aguilera had worked together; Luhrmann directed the 2001 musical film "Moulin Rouge!" whereby Aguilera was one of the lead acts on the soundtrack single "Lady Marmalade".

The track listing for the soundtrack was released on August 4, 2016; Mike Wass of Idolator noted that "Telepathy" could possibly be a disco track given that Rodgers is credited as a featured artist and the disco theme of the series. "Telepathy" premiered on August 11, the day before the release of the soundtrack and TV series. The song was released in Italy to contemporary hit radio on August 23. Multiple remixes were commissioned and made available for digital download. On September 16, a six-track remix EP was released featuring remixes by Rare Candy, Eric Kupper, Solidisco, Malay & Young Bombs, Tobtok and Moto Blanco. Another remix by Le Youth was released September 30. Daniel Megarry of the "Gay Times" suggested that the release of the remixes was an effort to boost sales of the track.

"Telepathy" is a disco song which lasts for a duration of three minutes, eleven seconds. The "dreamy" and "euphoric" instrumentation, provided by Nile Rodgers, Homer Steinweiss, Nick Movshon and Thomas Brenneck, consists of "vibrant" strings and horns, drums, brass and harps. "PopCrush" writer Bradley Stern noted that the addition of Rodgers "signature joyful, dance floor-friendly" sound adds a "touch of authenticity". Producer Nelson George described the track as being reminiscent of "1970s vogueing anthems popular at vogue-club balls like the House of LaBeija." Samuel Suri of the "Daily Mail" likened Aguilera's "spiral" falsetto melismas to the vocal stylings of Mariah Carey. "Entertainment Weekly" writer Joey Nolfi placed "Telepathy" somewhere in between the compositions of her fifth studio album "Back to Basics" (2006) and the lead single from her seventh album "Lotus", "Your Body" (2012).

"Telepathy" garnered a positive response from music critics. Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass was initially underwhelmed by "Telepathy" upon its release. According to him, he downloaded the song regardless, and added it to what he calls his "Upbeat Xtina" playlist. He writes that a few months later, the song played on shuffle and he realized that he had previously brushed off what he now believed to be one of the best and most underrated songs of 2016. Robbie Daw of the same publication was complimentary of Aguilera's vocal performance, opining that she "sings beautifully amidst a swirling wall of sound." He continued to write that it was a welcome change of tempo following the release of her previous single, "Change". Samuel Suri of the "Daily Mail" similarly praised the singer's vocals, writing that she "bringing her breathtaking blend of growling and belting to a disco anthem." 

Bradley Stern from "PopCrush" described the song as a "shimmering, strut-friendly contribution to the soundtrack" and praised Aguilera's "mighty" vocals. He noted that while the disco sound is not necessarily an insight into the creative direction of Aguilera's upcoming eighth studio album, he would not be opposed to hearing more collaborations between the singer, Rodgers and the song's co-writer, Sia Furler. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner described the "throwback" song as a "glittering disco track" and that her "massive vocals" compliment the composition. Joey Nolfi of "Entertainment Weekly" described "Telepathy" as the "funkiest" release by Aguilera for several years. Fuse.tv called it one of the best songs of 2016.

Commercially, "Telepathy" achieved the most success in the United States, where it reached number-one on the "Billboard" Dance Club Songs chart for the issue dated November 12, 2016. It reached the top twenty in its third week, charting at number 18, and topped the chart in its seventh. "Telepathy" became Aguilera's ninth number-one song on the Dance Club Songs chart—her first being "Beautiful" in 2003—and her first since "Say Something" with A Great Big World in May 2014; the track also became Rodgers' fourth chart-topper. Rodgers has achieved four number-ones since "I'll Be There", a collaboration with Chic, in June 2015; only Rihanna has achieved more number-one songs in that time span, with five. "Telepathy" also reached number 31 on the "Billboard" Twitter Top Tracks. Elsewhere, the song failed to replicate the same success. It reached the top 40 on the Urban chart in the Flanders region of Belgium, where it peaked at number 38 and spent a total of three weeks on the chart. In France, "Telepathy" spent one week at number 120.

Due to the song's success on the US Dance Club Songs chart, Aguilera decided to self-produce a music video for "Telepathy" as a thank you gift, stating on Facebook "I wanted to make a fun video for my fans since 'Telepathy' from "The Get Down" is #1 on the "Billboard" Dance Club Songs Chart. Thanks to all the fans, radio and DJs loving the song!" However, it was pointed out by MTV News and "Entertainment Weekly" that at the time of Aguilera posting her message on Facebook, "Telepathy" was number-two on the chart and had not yet reached number-one.

Directed by Hannah Lux Davis, it is Aguilera's first music video as a soloist in four years and, despite the song being more than three minutes long, the video itself is 96 seconds in length. It consists of the singer sitting in a multi-colored room dressed in disco-themed sequined clothes, including knee-high boots, with a large hair style as she holds a disco ball. She is also seen lying down on a glittering pool table. Deepa Lakshmin of MTV News thought that given the theme of "The Get Down", it "makes sense" that the video should be disco-themed. Writing for "Billboard", Taylor Weatherby noted that the video is "short-but-sweet" and did not blame her for wanting to celebrate the song reaching number-one and having some fun. Joey Nolfi for "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that her large hair style was reminiscent of how she had it around the time of the release of "Moulin Rouge!". "Gay Times" writer Daniel Megarry joked that the size of Aguilera's hair would "make RuPaul jealous".

Pyromaniac (Oh Land song)

"Pyromaniac" is a song by Danish singer-songwriter Oh Land, taken from her third studio album "Wish Bone" (2013). It was released digitally as the album's second single on 2 September 2013 by Tusk or Tooth and A:larm Music, exclusively in Denmark. The track was written by Oh Land and Jimmy Harry, and produced by David Andrew Sitek. A combination of funk, pop, and soul music, "Pyromaniac" features a hook with repetitive lyrics and was compared to the works of several artists, including the Cardigans,
Robyn, and Phoenix.

Receiving a mixed response from music critics, "Pyromaniac" was highlighted for being a strong track on "Wish Bone" but faulted for being inferior to her previous singles. A music video for the single was released on 13 September 2013 and directed by Rasmus Weng Karlsen and Jasper Carlberg. It features the singer in a variety of outfits.

"Pyromaniac" is taken from Oh Land's third studio album, "Wish Bone" (2013). The album's second single overall, "Pyromaniac" was released as a digital download on 2 September 2013 by Tusk or Tooth Records and A:larm Music; it was distributed exclusively in Denmark. It was written by Oh Land and Jimmy Harry, and produced by David Andrew Sitek. Additionally, several musicians contributed to the track, including drummer Nathaniel Morton, Todd Simon who played brass instruments, and Zeph Showers who served as the head audio engineer and mixer. The song itself was recorded at Federal Prism Studios in Glendale, California.

Musically, "Pyromaniac" features a "sweet melody" and "occasional minor-key twists". Leonie Cooper from "NME" described the song's genre as "straight-up lo-fi funk" and claimed it "com[es] on like Robyn produced by Phoenix". Continuing, Michael Jose Gonzalez of "Gaffa" called it a mixture of pop, funk, and soul music. Throughout the song, Oh Land repeatedly sings "woo-hoo", which was considered reminiscent to some of her previous singles. Jennifer Joh from "Neon Tommy" compared it to the Cardigans' 1996 single "Lovefool".

"Pyromaniac" received a mixed to positive response from music critics. "NME"s Leonie Cooper called it "remarkable", while James Christopher Monger from AllMusic called the song a "better version" of Oh Land's "My Boxer" (2013); he also described it as "Studio 54-kissed". "Gaffa"s Michael Jose Gonzalez listed "Renaissance Girls", "My Boxer", and "Pyromaniac" as three potential hits from "Wish Bone" in his album review. In a highly positive review, "Neon Tommy"s Jennifer Joh called it "very quintessential Oh Land" and "different and clearly inspired by more classic songs". In a more mixed review, Christopher Monk from musicOMH felt that the song (and the parent album) was not "lacking in hooks" and considered it one of "Wish Bone"s strongest tracks, but overall said that it (along with "Bird in an Aeroplane" and "Cherry on Top") cannot match the quality or catchiness of her previous singles, listing "Sun of a Gun" and "White Nights" as two examples. Similarly, Hannah Eads from "The Daily Nebraskan" considered both "Pyromaniac" and "Renaissance Girls" to be "just as edgy and catchy as the first", but claimed that "the songs contribute nothing new to the genre". 

An accompanying music video for "Pyromaniac" was directed by Rasmus Weng Karlsen and Jasper Carlberg. It was released on 13 September 2013 via Oh Land's official YouTube account. The video features the singer in a wide variety of outfits. Some of the scenes include Oh Land in front of several fire dancers, singing in front of a mirror, and skinny dipping with a group of friends. During the aforementioned scene where Oh Land appears swimming in the nude, censor bars are used.

Cyber Danganronpa VR: The Class Trial

The game was released in Japan in October 2016, and worldwide in March 2017. The game is a tech demo where the player aims to uncover who was behind a murder in a "class trial" from the first game in the series, "". It was well received by critics, who enjoyed its visuals.

"Cyber Danganronpa VR" is a virtual reality game in which the player plays through the fourth "class trial" from the adventure game "", where the player aims to uncover who was behind the murder of Sakura Ogami; unlike the original game, which uses 2D cutouts for characters, "Cyber Danganronpa VR" uses 3D models. The player character's classmates give testimonies, which appear as words; if the player notices something in the testimony that seems suspicious, they can refute the words by shooting them with "truth bullets". To do this, the player needs to turn their head toward the character who testified, and press a button on the DualShock 4 controller. The game takes around ten minutes to play through, and ends with a first-person sequence where the character Monokuma murders the player.

"Cyber Danganronpa VR" was announced and shown at the Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong fair in July 2015 by Sony Interactive Entertainment, as a tech demo for their virtual reality headset PlayStation VR. The game was developed by Spike Chunsoft, and was their first PlayStation 4 project. According to producer Yoshinori Terasawa, he was inspired to create the game by Bandai Namco Entertainment's PlayStation VR title "Summer Lesson". The reason for making a game based on "Trigger Happy Havoc" rather than the spin-off shooting game "" was that other companies could create virtual reality shooting games, and that the developers wanted to create something that only they could make. Terasawa decided to make the punishment sequence play out from a first-person perspective to make the player feel horror, but also included Monokuma to lighten the mood. To be able to complete the game quickly, the developers made use of the game engine Unreal Engine 4.

The game was released digitally for the PlayStation 4 on October 13, 2016 in Japan and Hong Kong; it was made available freely for PlayStation Plus subscribers, with no release announced for players without a subscription. The Hong Kong release was made available in English, with English voice overs; Spike Chunsoft announced in October 2016 that they were working towards releasing that version in the West. It was released in North America on March 7, 2017, and in Europe on March 10.

"Hardcore Gamer" Edward Dang was positive to the game, and hoped that it would lead to virtual reality releases of complete "Danganronpa" games. Jordan Devore at Destructoid thought that the game did not look exciting based on off-screen footage, but noted that this often is the case for virtual reality games, and thought that it "could be the start of something neat". Chris Carter, also writing for Destructoid, enjoyed the game and called it worth playing, but not something to get excited over due to its short length. Aki Otsuki at 4Gamer.net recommended the game, and said that experiencing the punishment sequence in virtual reality was horrifying. "Famitsu" liked the immersion given by the virtual reality and the 360-degree movements. Hiroaki Mabuchi at IGN Japan said that the new environment graphics were a great reproduction of their "Trigger Happy Havoc" counterparts, and that the mysterious atmosphere suited "Danganronpa" well.

Every Mother Counts 2012

Every Mother Counts 2012 is the second compilation album in Starbucks annual series, released by Hear Music on May 1, 2012. Featuring thirteen previously unavailable tracks, the album was sold exclusively at Starbucks locations and benefited Christy Turlington's Every Mother Counts foundation, which seeks to increase childbirth safety for mothers. The compilation received a positive critical reception.

"Every Mother Counts 2012" is the second album in Starbucks' annual series (following the 2011 album of the same name), released by its retail music concept and record label Hear Music. The album was available only at Starbucks locations in the United States and Canada between May 1 and 29, in celebration of Mother's Day. Eight dollars from each twelve dollar album sale benefited Christy Turlington's foundation of the same name, which seeks to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers.

The compilation album includes 19 songs by various artists. Thirteen of the tracks were previously unreleased; the six existing recordings were: "Wish for You" by Faith Hill, Sade's "The Sweetest Gift", "I Remember" by Lauryn Hill, Seal's "Secret", "Fragilidad" (1988) by Sting, and David Bowie's "Everyone Says 'Hi'". Turlington said of the album: I went to friends first, as I did with the first CD. Bono and Chris Martin were great supporters of the project the first time around, and when I knew I wanted to include men on this album they were obvious choices. They are also both fathers to daughters. Others, such as Patti Smith and Rita Wilson, I've known for a long time, and some, like Edie Brickell and Paul Simon, I only met briefly but was a huge admirer. I generally wanted a diverse group of artists who were parents, or in the case of Edward Sharpe, who will be soon. We wanted to reach a broad audience on this issue with this particular project and with a range of perspectives.

The album opens with Bono and The Edge's acoustic "Original of the Species" (2004). Turlington said of the track, "Bono wrote the song with his daughters in mind. It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you take your steps forward and I'm supporting your independence, but at the same time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' Any parent can relate to that." The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice at the start of the track, saying "check, check" and "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. "Skipping" is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start. He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that their dad contributed to such a meaningful project.

The third track is "Pretty Day", performed by Brickell and Simon. Following it are three previously released recordings by Faith Hill, Sade, and Lauryn Hill. The seventh and eighth songs are "Baby I'm Yours" by Wilson, and "Don't Fence Me In", performed by Diana Krall, followed by Seal's previously available recording. The tenth and eleventh tracks are a live rendition of "Sister" by Dave Matthews Band and Sting's previously available song, respectively.

Following these are Alanis Morissette's "Magical Child", which was written as a tribute to her son, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros' "Mother", and Bowie's previously released recording. "Mother" features music put to a poem written by Alex Ebert; the band recorded a music video for the song, which "The Huffington Post" described as having an "almost hypnotic" groove with a "late-1960s/early-1970s psychedelic vibe".

The next tracks are a "flute-inflected" version of "Get Up Stand Up" by Cedella Marley, Beck's "Corrina, Corrina" (1928), a traditional folk song most notably covered by Bob Dylan, and "Instead of the Dead" by Rufus Wainwright. The album's final tracks are Smith's "Somalia" and an acoustic rendition of "Yellow" (2000) by Coldplay. Turlington said of "Somalia": Patti told me she wrote this song years ago, after seeing a segment on the news in which a child literally died in the arms of its mother. That memory was still very present to her in 2011 during the crisis in the Horn of Africa, so she thought, "If I could give this mother what I have — fruit on the trees, a healthy child — I would." She went into the studio and brought along her daughter, who's now grown and married, to play piano, and gave us this version of the song.

The album, and Vedder's "Skipping" in particular, received positive reception. In May 2012, "Skipping" was one of "The Globe and Mail" "songs you need to hear this week", in the pop category. The newspaper's Brad Wheeler called the album "mom-friendly tuneage" and Vedder's track a "heartfelt", "sweet" song with a "cute" contribution from his daughter. Writing for "The Huffington Post", music journalist Kristi York Wooten said, "Each song is a gift from the artists, given in honor of mothers everywhere". She offered commentary on select tracks, including "Skipping" (the "sentiment about the unique bond between a parent and child transcends both gender and time"), and "Pretty Day", which she said "might get you singing along instantly". Wooten called Beck's contribution "thematically coherent and stylistically diverse", and Smith's track "arresting", "reflective and beautiful".

I Won't Be the One to Let Go

"I Won't Be the One to Let Go" is a song recorded by American singer Barbra Streisand and Barry Manilow for the former's sixth compilation album, "Duets" (2002). It was released as the album's only single on November 4, 2002, by Columbia Records. The track was written and produced by Richard Marx with additional songwriting coming from Manilow and additional production handled by Walter Afanasieff. Initially an airplay and streaming-only single in the United States, a promotional CD single of "I Won't Be the One to Let Go" was released and includes the radio edit and album version of the song.

An adult contemporary pop ballad, the single contains lyrics discussing mutual love in a relationship and dismissing fears of abandonment. The song divided music critics, with some calling it sweet and "feel-good", but others describing it as mediocre and unmemorable. In 2014, Streisand featured "I Won't Be the One to Let Go" as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of her 34th studio album, "Partners".

"I Won't Be the One to Let Go" is taken from Barbra Streisand's compilation album "Duets" (2002), a collection of 19 duets spanning from her career. Her duet with Barry Manilow is one of the record's two new tracks, the other being "All I Know of Love" with Josh Groban. "I Won't Be the One to Let Go" was written and produced by Richard Marx with additional songwriting coming from Manilow and additional production handled by Walter Afanasieff. It serves as Streisand's first single release since 1999's "If You Ever Leave Me", which was a duet with Vince Gill and is also featured as one of the nineteen songs on the parent album. 

The single was first available for digital streaming on AOL Music on November 4, 2002, as an exclusive privilege to website members. Although the track was not released commercially, "I Won't Be the One to Let Go" was distributed as a promotional CD single on January 6, 2003. With the release handled by Columbia Records, the CD was sent exclusively to United States radio stations and includes the "Radio Version Edit" and "Radio Version" releases of the song. In 2014, Streisand featured her duet as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of her 34th studio album, "Partners".

With a duration of four minutes and 41 seconds, "I Won't Be the One to Let Go" is an adult contemporary pop ballad, which, according to William Ruhlmann from "AllMusic", is similar to the entirety of the songs featured on "Duets". In an interview for "Barry Gram" magazine, Manilow expressed pleasure in having one of his songs sung by Streisand and called her voice "amazing". He elaborated:

I've just recorded it with the brilliant Barbra Streisand ... we sound like we like each other and mean what we're singing because we worked on it together, in the same room, for days and days before we went into the studio. I think that there's an obvious connection between the two of us (we actually come from the same neighborhood in Brooklyn) and I think you will be able to feel that when you hear the song. It's a wonderful duet and I'm very proud of the song.
Lyrically, Streisand and Manilow talk about mutual love in a relationship and, at times, they dismiss fears that they have, such as abandonment. During the second verse, they alternate: "Who knows what awaits us 'round the bend / Count on me, faithfully / Though everything we have could never end / It could never end." In the chorus, they sing: "This I swear, this I swear / I won't be the one to let go, to let go..."

A staff member at "Billboard" acknowledged both "I Won't Be the One to Let Go" and album track "All I Know of Love" as the "two fine new efforts" on "Duets", calling the former single a "sweet" collaboration. BBC Music's Morag Reavley enjoyed the single, calling it a "soaring, feel-good" track. However, William Ruhlmann from AllMusic was more critical of the song, describing it as just "mediocre". Tom Santopietro, author of "The Importance of Being Barbra: The Brilliant, Tumultuous Career of Barbra Streisand", called "I Won't Be the One to Let Go" a "paltry [...] new song" and ultimately found it to be unmemorable.

Ocean (Goldfrapp song)

"Ocean" is a song by English group Goldfrapp from their seventh studio album "Silver Eye" (2017). It was released as the album's first promotional single on 10 March 2017 through Mute Records. The song was written and produced by Alison Goldfrapp and William Owen Gregory, with additional production coming from The Haxan Cloak and John Congleton. An electronic and synth-rock song, "Ocean" marks the return of Goldfrapp's heavy use of synths in their music. Written in couplets, the lyrics were described as dark by several commentators. Critics also drew comparisons between "Ocean" and the works of other musicians and groups, such as Shirley Manson, Nine Inch Nails, and Depeche Mode.

The song generated positive feedback from music critics, with most of them acclaiming it for being emotional and dramatic. Others noted that "Ocean" served as a strong album closer to "Silver Eye". A remix of "Ocean" was released on 21 May 2018 as the fourth single from "Silver Eye" and the first from the deluxe edition reissue of the album. It features guest vocals from Depeche Mode frontman Dave Gahan. A music video for this version of "Ocean" was also released and serves as a continuation to prior music videos created for "Silver Eye". Following the remix of "Ocean" being released, the original version charted at number 191 in France.

"Ocean" was the first of two promotional singles to be released from "Silver Eye", with the other being "Moon in Your Mouth" which was released two weeks later; the song was distributed to digital retailers on 10 March 2017 through Mute Records following its initial debut on "Billboard"s official website. It was written and produced by members Alison Goldfrapp and William Owen Gregory with The Haxan Cloak and John Congleton serving as additional producers. While creating material for "Silver Eye", the duo had trouble writing songs that they actually enjoyed; Goldfrapp claimed that "it always takes about three months to write all the rubbish out of your system before you get something you like". Along with the announcement of "Ocean" as a promotional single, tickets for a promotional tour for "Silver Eye" were made available for purchase, with show legs in Europe and the United States. 

Speaking on behalf of its sound, Gary Graff from "Billboard" compared the electronic sound in "Ocean" to Goldfrapp's previous albums "Black Cherry" (2003) and "Supernature" (2005). Additionally, he felt that the track is unlike their previous release, "Tales of Us" (2013), in that it does not contain a "pastoral" sound. Instead, the track contains "heavy electronic beats" and an emphasis on "pulse-pounding synths". Both Goldfrapp and Gregory acknowledged the return to using synths in their music, with the former claiming that it created a "tougher sound" to the track overall. Categorizing the genre of the song as synth-rock, Alexa Camp from "Slant Magazine" claimed that she could picture Shirley Manson singing the lyrics to "Ocean". Referring to its sound as "dark" and "churning", "Spin"s Anna Gaca noted the "pounding industrial core and [the] faintly sinister processing effect applied to [her] vocals". Labelling the track as a ballad, Sean T. Collins from "Pitchfork" declared it the cri de coeur on "Silver Eye". He further explained that the lyrics contain imagery depicting nature and that the composition uses "big, echoey washes of sound" in order to produce an "enveloping, absorbing, and suffocating" sound. 

In a series of couplets, Goldfrapp sings "I borrowed bones, I borrowed skin / To save me from the hell I'm in, your fantasy / And every time I think of you / I see the dark, I hear their hooves", which registers a theme of transformation, according to Chris White from "musicOMH". Towards the song's end, she repeats "they're coming for you" in a "reedy and distorted" voice. The track's sound was compared to the works of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails by David Chiu of "Consequence of Sound". Furthermore, Chris Gerard, a writer for "PopMatters", compared the production's sound to being intoxicated.

"Ocean" generally received praise from contemporary music critics. Heather Phares from AllMusic applauded its role as the closing track on "Silver Eye" for containing "operatic drama" and an "industrial crunch". Similarly, Anna Gaca from "Spin" found it necessary for "Ocean" to be the album's final track; she wrote that it "is so heavy and foreboding that is practically has to end the album, for fear of sinking it if were it to appear any earlier in the sequence". Additionally, Gaca claimed that the listener could decipher the outside collaborators that contributed to both "Ocean" and album track "Zodiac Black". Calling it a "rather dramatic close" on the album, Chiu from "Consequence of Sound" speculated that it may be Goldfrapp's "heaviest and most emotional song" from their recently recorded material. Listing "Ocean" as an example, "The Guardian"s Alexis Petridis said that the Haxan Cloak's production on several tracks on "Silver Eye" seemed like a "conscious attempt to meld the two polarities of Goldfrapp's sound". Because of this, she thought that the song "prickle[d] with chilly malevolence". Olivia Riggio, a writer for "The Ithacan", complimented Goldfrapp's vocals and the "ominous and powerful" lyrics; she stated that the song should in fact "be called 'Odyssey' because it is an epic". However, Sam Steiger of "Hot Press" was more negative to the song, stating that although it's interesting, "overall the sensation is of treading water".

A remix of "Ocean" featuring guest vocals from English musician Dave Gahan was released as a digital download on 21 May 2018. It is included on the deluxe edition reissue of "Silver Eye", which will be released on 6 July 2018; the remix was released simultaneously with the pre-order for the album. Regarding the collaboration, the group issued a statement: "Working with Dave Gahan on the new version of 'Ocean' had been a real honor for us as a band." A promotional CD single of "Ocean" was also released in a limited distribution by Mute Records.

Kory Grow from "Rolling Stone" noted how Gahan's baritone vocals "add[ed] a little warmth to the choruses". Noting influence from synthpop, "Stereogum"s Tom Breihan compared the remix to the works of Gahan's band Depeche Mode, particularly songs from the group's seventh studio album, "Violator" (1990).

The remix received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Lauren O'Neill from Noisey wrote in her article that the remix was "the sort of collab that should have happened much sooner". She went on to say that the Goldfrapp and Depeche Mode seem to have chemistry, musically, which made the remix successful. One year later, Kaye wrote an extended review of the new version: "Unsurprisingly, Gahan slips in comfortably, sitting in between the pounding electronics and Alison Goldfrapp’s own vocals like he was always meant to be there." Following the new version of "Ocean" being released, the original rendition entered the official SNEP record chart in France. On 26 May 2018, it debuted and peaked at number 191 before departing the chart the following week.

A music video for the remix of "Ocean" was also released on 21 May 2018. It was directed by Alison Goldfrapp and serves as an extension to the various music videos created for "Silver Eye", including previous singles "Anymore" and "Everything Is Never Enough". Like the aforementioned videos, the shots of Goldfrapp singing were filmed in Fuerteventura. She appears in a dress and veil while "slow-motion scenes of horses appear" are shown as Gahan sings. He filmed his parts while touring with Depeche Mode in Madrid.

Yo Nací Para Amarte

"Yo Nací Para Amarte" () is a song written by Kike Santander and performed by Mexican recording artist Alejandro Fernández. It was co-produced by Santander and Emilio Estefan and was released as the fourth and final single by Sony Music Mexico from "Me Estoy Enamorando" in 1998. The song is a bolero-pop ballad with ranchera influences and portrays the singer confessing his love which he admits "goes beyond reason".

It reached the top of the "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States and spent five weeks at this position. The recording led to Fernández receiving a nomination for Hot Latin Track of the Year and Pop Hot Latin Track of the Year at the 1999 "Billboard" Latin Music Awards while Santander received a BMI Latin Award for the track in the same year.

Since 1992, Alejandro Fernández established his music career as a ranchera singer like his father, iconic ranchera singer, Vicente Fernández. His previous albums, "Alejandro Fernández" (1992), "Piel De Niña" (1993), "Grandes Éxitos a la Manera de Alejandro Fernández" (1994), "Que Seas Muy Feliz" (1995), and "Muy Dentro de Mi Corazón" (1996), helped solidify Fernández as a ranchera singer. Although his last album, "Muy Dentro de Mi Corazón", was a success, Fernández did not want to simply record another ranchera album. "If I had released another album of just rancheras, people would have just expected the same thing, and then they would have begun to judge me by that one [musical] theme", Fernández explained. He also noted bolero's popularity on radio stations and cited his waning radio airplay. After listening to "Mi Tierra" by Gloria Estefan, Fernández sought Estefan's husband Emilio Estefan to have him produced Fernández's next album. After hearing Fernández's proposal, Emilio Estefan agreed on the idea to produce the album. Recording took place at Estefan's Crescent Moon Studios in Miami, Florida.
"Yo Nací Para Amarte", along with the other tracks in the album, is a bolero-pop ballad song with ranchera influences. The song was written by Colombian songwriter Kike Santander and co-produced by Santander and Estefan. The sound features the usage of strings, maracas, trumpets and percussion. In the lyrics, the protagonist declares his love and admits it "goes beyond reason".

"Yo Nací Para Amarte" was released as the fourth and final single from "Me Estoy Enamorando". In the United States, the single debuted at number 39 on the "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs chart on the week of 6 June 1998. It reached the top of the chart six weeks later succeeding "Rezo" by Carlos Ponce. The song spent five consecutive weeks in this position until it was replaced by "Una Fan Enamorada" by Servando & Florentino. The song ended 1998 as the seventh best-performing Latin song of the year in the US. The track also reached number two on the Latin Pop Songs chart. In November 1999, "Yo Nací Para Amarte" was labeled as one of the "hottest tracks" for Sony Discos in a list including the most successful songs released by the label since the launch of the "Billboard" Hot Latin Tracks chart in 1986.

Eliseo Cardona of "El Nuevo Herald" highlighted "Yo Nací Para Amarte" as one of the boleros where Fernández performs with "intensity and passion". At the 1999 "Billboard" Latin Music Awards, "Yo Nací Para Amarte" was nominated for Hot Latin Track of the Year and Pop Hot Latin Track of the Year. Fernández lost the first award to "Por Mujeres Como Tu" by Pepe Aguilar and the second to "Vuelve" by Ricky Martin. The track also led to Santander receiving a BMI Latin Award in 1999 in recognition of the best-performing Latin songs in 1998.

Midnighter (2015 comic book)

Midnighter is an American comic book series published by DC Comics and written by Steve Orlando that ran for twelve issues (plus an un-numbered preview issue) from June 2015 to July 2016, featuring Midnighter as its protagonist. The series is also known as Midnighter (Volume 2) to differentiate itself from the character's previous series first published by WildStorm in 2006.

The release of "Midnighter" marked the first time a gay man was the protagonist in an ongoing series released by one of the "Big Two" comic book publishers (Marvel and DC Comics). Despite its underwhelming sales, "Midnighter" was met with critical acclaim from professional critics, who praised among other things the series' fast-paced events and its portrayal of queer characters. The series appeared on numerous publications' end-of-year lists, and won "Best New Series" from Broken Frontier's 2015 awards program. Two "Midnighter" trade paperbacks were released in 2016, with seven and five issues each. A 6-issue miniseries sequel titled "Midnighter and Apollo", also written by Orlando, ran from October 2016 to March 2017.

In September 2011, after the conclusion of the "Flashpoint" story arc wherein The Flash, in an attempt to prevent his mother's murder caused irreparable damage to the DC Universe's timestream, DC merged the universe of its WildStorm imprint into a rebooted DC Universe in a relaunch known as The New 52. The character's first appearance in New 52 continuity was in a "Stormwatch" series released as part of the first wave of titles, and was a younger, single version of the character, replete with a new costume. Intended to be a significant part of this new universe, "Stormwatch" was a commercial and critical disappointment. Midnighter's characterization was criticized for being too distant of his WildStorm version and his costume, which included a chin spike, was so disliked that it was even referenced in the comic itself. After some relaunch attempts, "Stormwatch" was cancelled at issue #30.

"Midnighter" release was part of "DC You", a marketing campaign to reinvigorate DC Comics' image. In May 2015, during the "Convergence" event, the publisher released digital sneak previews for several of its current and upcoming titles, all featuring a short new story. The Midnighter preview was titled "Perdition Pistol" and was included in the comic book "Nightwing/Oracle" #2. Series promotion included video interviews with Steve Orlando and Jase Peeples, entertainment editor of "The Advocate", which also presented a short history of DC's LGBT characters to celebrate the release and LGBT Pride Month. "Midnighter" first issue was released in June, together with another twenty new DC Comics' titles. The series had a traditional publication, with a 20-page issue priced at $2.99 released monthly, and is codified in comics tracking as "Midnighter Volume 2" to avoid confusion with the character's previous series.

"Midnighter" represented both a new path and a return to the character's roots. It re-established his over-the-top acts of graphic violence and focused on his community work with everyday people, a similar scenario to the character's early days in the WildStorm Universe before joining Stormwatch. This Midnighter, however, is considerably younger than his WildStorm counterpart, and desires to have a more social life. According to writer Steve Orlando, he began writing "Midnighter" after Mark Doyle, "Batman"'s editor, asked if he wanted to "pitch" any character. In an interview with "Comic Vine", Orlando described Midnighter as

ACO, the title's main artist, brought to the comic a characteristic style, which features a large number of small panels to highlight the constant action scenes present in the story. He formed a collaboration with Hugo Petrus, who was co-credited as an inker for all of their issues and as a penciller for the last four issues. Stephen Mooney, who also pencilled "Grayson", was the artist of issues #4 and 5.

The series had a close relationship with "Grayson", a rebooted Dick Grayson solo comic. The characters Midnighter, Dick Grayson and Helena Bertinelli are frequently featured in both comic books. "Midnighter" begins shortly after the end of his relationship with Andrew Pulaski, known as the hero Apollo. This decision, according to Orlando, was made to define Midnighter as a stand-alone character with his own sexual experiences with other people, while slowly building both characters' new interactions. The writer cites Christopher Marlowe, Orlando Cruz, Tab Hunter, John McClane, Emile Griffith, John Woo and Melvin Van Peebles as inspirations for the title character's personality.

New in the city of Oakland, Midnighter arranges a date with a man called Jason. Suddenly, the restaurant where they are is invaded by Modoran mercenaries searching for three of their countrymen, making Midnighter reveal himself and beat them in a fight. Afterwards, Midnighter takes Jason to his apartment and installs a "smartalk" in him, in which Jason can contact him wherever he is. He also talks about his recent breakup with Andrew Pulaski (Apollo), saying he could not handle pretending to be a normal human and that Andrew is too good for him. Feeling too intimidated, Jason prefers to be just friends with Midnighter.

Called by The Gardener, Midnighter discovers the God Garden was robbed by a mysterious intruder who took several weapons and also a file containing his past memories before he was genetically enhanced. He starts a search to recover everything that was lost while beginning to date Matt, whom he met during the Modoran attack. Midnighter finds the first weapon, a powered necklace, with Marina Lucas, who was using it to avenge her husband's death by food poisoning. He finds another weapon while saving Amanda Riley, a little schoolgirl kidnapped by Multiplex, a villain in the employ of Mr. Rohmer, a corrupt businessman who sought the power of the God Garden. Rohmer reveals that he pretended to use Amanda as a guinea pig for a machine he built using God Garden technology. Beaten by Midnighter, he revealed that he acquired the tech from a Russian man named Noi Akakievitch.

Midnighter then abducts Dick Grayson to help him with his mission in Russia. There, they go after a secret inn administered by Guire Grando, an employee of Akakievitch. Grando takes homeless people from the streets and makes them go through a treatment with reprogrammed martian cells (originally from the God Garden) that transform them into vampire-like creatures, who are murdered for entertainment by the hooligan youngsters that frequent the inn. Midnighter and Grayson succeed in taking down the place, attracting Akakievitch's attention, who wants to have the Midnighter's computer brain technology. Then, Midnighter and Grayson go to his lair, where they fight and beat martian cells manipulated beasts, defeating Akakievitch, who reveals that he received the technology from a mysterious supplier.

Back home, Midnighter celebrates Thanksgiving for the first time with Matt, when they are attacked by Multiplex. Midnighter manages to defeat him, only to find out a few days later that Matt's father was also attacked. He and Matt go visit the man, who lives in a small town in Connecticut, and Midnighter begins investigating the place. While investigating at a nearby bar, he is attacked by a gang and during the fight, he discovers they are not humans, but rather androids created with God Garden technology. Midnighter then goes back to Matt's father's house and attacks him, revealing him to also be an android. Matt stabs Midnighter, revealing himself as the supervillain Prometheus and confessing to stealing the tech from the God Garden with the intention of taking down all superheroes, starting with Midnighter. They begin fighting and Prometheus reveals he downloaded all of Midnighter's origin file into his brain and destroyed the original, so if Midnighter kills him, all his early history would be destroyed. Midnighter does not mind and beats down Prometheus, who manages to escape severely injured. After that, Midnighter goes to take a drink with his friend Tony.

Oakland, California and Boston, Massachusetts, are the cities where most of "Midnighter" action happens. This breaks from DC tradition, as most DC stories take place in fictional DC locales. Thanks to the door technology, however, Midnighter can easily travel to any place in the world. Cities Bridgewater, Massachusetts, Rochester, New York, Richmond, California, Tacoma, Washington and Detroit, Michigan, as well as Florida Keys, Baffin Island (Canada) and the Darvaza gas crater (Turkmenistan) are also depicted through the series. Fictional Opal City is often shown during scenes with Apollo, who lives there. Porter, a fictional small town located in Connecticut, was also depicted, as well as another fictional country named Modora.

Much of the series takes place in Russia. Steve Orlando, himself a Russian culture admirer, explained the connection made between Midnighter and the place:

In February 2016, DC Comics announced another relaunch, DC Rebirth, which mostly consisted of relaunches for their traditional titles like "Batman", "Superman" and "Wonder Woman". "Midnighter" and other DC You titles like "Starfire" and "Black Canary" did not have new series announced, and ended their runs at the twelfth issue, a decision criticized by some media outlets. Oliver Sava, writing for "The A.V. Club", said that "it’s unfortunate that ["Midnighter"] is heading to its conclusion when it feels like this creative team still has so much more to offer", adding that "DC hasn’t done much to increase [Midnighter's] profile. [They] could have used this critical acclaim to promote the book." Jon Erik Christianson from "Panels" lamented the lack of representation that would happen with the cancellation of one of the few mainstream LGBT comic books.

Midnighter's first DC Rebirth appearance was in a flashback in "Nightwing Rebirth" #1, released in July 2016. DC announced a miniseries titled "Midnighter and Apollo" later that year.

The announcement of "Midnighter" release in February 2015 generated instant media interest due to the premise of the series being the first to prominently feature a gay superhero. "The New York Times" referred to Midnighter and the new wave of gay characters as ones who "zap stereotypes", calling it "a golden age for queer characters in comic books." Its writer, Gregory Schmidt, also expressed a belief that Midnighter's popularity "stems in part from efforts to make his sexual orientation just one aspect of his character."

Upon release, "Midnighter" issues received widespread acclaim from comics critics. At the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 10 to reviews from comics critics, the series received an average score of 8.2 based on 158 reviews. Reviewing the first issue, David Pepos from "Newsarama" gave it a maximum score, saying that "There aren't many books out there that I'd call perfect, but when you can see 10 steps ahead, it's perhaps not surprising that "The Midnighter" earns that praise. This book looks great, reads great, and is easily one of the best debuts from DC since the soft relaunch of Batgirl. If you've been skeptical about this character - and believe me, I was one of them - get ready for a spectacular change of heart." Keith Dooley of "Multiversity Comics" opined that "Midnighter is imperfect, has emotional issues, and yet has a hero’s heart. Darkness and light concurrently mingle to create such a promising and exciting opening chapter to what has the potential to be something great." Writing for "PopMatters", Matthew Fay felt the debut was a "reassuring and faithful reintroduction to the character" that "leaves open a lot of room for exploration."
Critic Jesse Schedeen described "Midnighter" #3 in IGN positively as "great about exploring [Midnighter's] dichotomies." Jeff Ayers from "Fanboys.Inc" commended the Midnighter and Grayson pairing in "Midnighter" #5, writing that "Orlando is still crafting a compelling story of theft and intrigue within Midnighter's world." Matt Santori-Griffith of "Comicosity" reported "Midnighter" as "Not just the gay hero I always wanted, but it’s the comic I’ve always wanted, period. Plus it’s the gay comic I’ve always wanted, with a world I recognize so deeply and naturally in the place I’ve been looking for it all my life. It’s all of it and more, none subsumed or accelerated over the other, all in perfect harmony. Until it all falls apart and you reduce a forty-year-old homosexual to shock and awe on the floor. Yes, I am a sucker for Midnighter’s charms. But admit it, so are you." in his review of the sixth issue. 

Writing about "Midnighter" #8, "Comic Vine"'s Tony 'G-Man' Guerrero believes that "With his attitude and action, [Midnighter is] not always the most likable character but Orlando succeeds in making readers care about it." Jideobi Odunze from "Geeked Out Nation" commended "the bond Midnighter has shared with others" in his "Midnighter" #10 review, feeling that "Everything about [Midnighter] is right on the surface for the most part." 

"Midnighter" #12, the series' final issue, received very positive reviews, being given maximum score from Josh McCullough at "We The Nerdy" ("It’s been one of the smartest, emotionally hard hitting and action packed series DC have had in a long time"), and "Comicosity" Mat Santori-Griffith ("Orlando, ACO, Petrus, and Fajardo have concluded this series with as much vigor and sensitivity as they carried throughout the previous 11 issues"). Jideobi Odunze at "Geeked Out Nation", said "Midnighter #12 was a marvelous ending to a series you would have to be crazy to have missed. The action, the humor, the everything you got from this series that you don’t from all the rest from DC at this time. Not to mention the team-up with Spyral and Suicide Squad. This is how you do comics." "Newsarama" C.K. Stewart stated "[It] provides all the closure we needed for this stand-out series", and "Comic Crusaders" commented "I've not been able to find a flaw with any issue of this one until now, and that flaw is simply...it's the last issue."

Less positive about the series, Jim Werner from "Weird Science" described it as "good at it's best and awful for the rest of the time" in his reviews, calling Orlando's dialogue "close to laughable" and Midnighter "a tough sell as a character." "Midnighter" constant artist changes during its run were also criticised by some critics. "The Rainbow Hub"'s Sam Riedel wrote "it’s better in my mind to establish a series’ aesthetic before switching up art duties", while Jarrod Jones of "Doom Rocket" declared that ""Midnighter" is too good to settle for menial sequentials", and added "For a book like this, DC would do well to roll out the red carpet for its best and brightest."

Together with "The Omega Men", "Midnighter" was the most acclaimed DC Comics book of 2015, appearing on more than twenty year-end lists of industry publications. "The A.V. Club" included it at number fifteen on its list of favorite comic books of 2015, stating that "Midnighter" has proven to be one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books, as well as one of the more emotionally weighty ones." "io9" named it one of 2015's twenty best comic books, and commented that ""Midnighter" balances its brilliant superhero action with a frank, refreshing, and sex-positive look at its hero’s life."

In 2015, "Midnighter" won a Broken Frontier Award for Best New Series, and was runner-up at the All-Comic Awards in a similar category, losing to "We Can Never Go Home". The series also received a GLAAD Media Award nomination for Outstanding Comic Book, but lost to "Lumberjanes".

Covering its first seven issues and the sneak peek, "Midnighter" first trade paperback was released on February 17, 2016. "Midnighter: Out", titled after the series' first arc, has the same cover art of the debut comic book issue. The second trade paperback, titled "Hard", was released on October 19, 2016 and has the same cover as "Midnighter" #12. Along with the series' second arc, "Hard" also collects issues #7–8 from Midnighter's previous WildStorm book and "Seoul Brothers", an Apollo and Midnighter story from "Young Romance: The New 52 Valentine's Day Special" #1.

"Midnighter" #1 debuted at number eighty-three on Diamond Comic Distributors best-selling comics ranking for June 2015, with 32,200 copies distributed, being the seventeenth best-selling DC comic book series debut in that month. It was the series' only issue to chart in the top 100, after "Midnighter" #2 had 61.5% less copies distributed next month, placing at number one hundred and twenty-nine. 

The trade "Midnighter: Out" had 1,678 copies accounted during its release month, February 2016, in Diamond distributed comic shops. It was placed at number forty-four on Diamond's trade paperbacks chart. Released in October of the same year, "Midnighter: Hard" had 1,232 copies distributed during its release month, placing at number ninety on the same chart. According to DC co-publisher, Dan DiDio, "[DC] has seen more life for "Midnighter" in the graphic novel area." He further explained: "with the "Midnighter" book in particular, [which had] a lot of great press, a lot of great reviews, that's where we've seen reviews really inform the sales on the graphic novel collection." Steve Orlando described "Midnighter" trade sales as "very, very nice with a huge amount of support from fans and readers."

In June 2016, "The New York Times" published that DC Comics would release a "Midnighter" sequel, "Midnighter and Apollo", as a 6-issue miniseries, starting in October of the same year. Steve Orlando returned to writing, with interior art by Fernando Blanco and covers by ACO. Romulo Fajardo Jr. also returned as colorist. The series lasted until March 2017.

Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout

Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout is a compilation album released by Nettwerk Records. It is the final installment in Nettwerk's "The Ultimate Chillout" series. The album features popular releases from Nettwerk-signed artists such as Delerium and Sarah McLachlan. It also features lesser-known works from other groups such as Bent, Ivy, and the Perishers. It was released in three formats on February 15, 2005, with two commercial CDs made available in Canada and the United States, and a promotional version used for radio distribution.

"Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout" received mixed reviews from music critics, with the track listing of the album being a popular point of discussion. While the mix of popular and lesser-known artists was appreciated, one critic disapproved of the actual music on the album, claiming that the collection's song rarely fit within the definition of chill-out music. 

In 2001, Nettwerk Records released "Chillout 2001: V.1", the first installment of "Chillout", a CD series featuring a collection of chill-out songs and music by Nettwerk-signed artists. Following additional installments over the years, Nettwerk released "Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout" on February 15, 2005. It serves as the last release from "The Ultimate Chillout" portion of the "Chillout" franchise. Three unique releases were created: one in Canada, one in the United States, and an advanced promotional copy used for radio airplay and not suitable for commercial distribution. The release of "Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout" was fronted by A&R and project coordinator George Maniatis, who authored the album's liner notes and an included thank you note. Producer Craig Waddell provided the final mastering of each of the collection's fourteen songs.

As considered standard by "PopMatters"s John Bergstrom, no "Chillout" release is "complete without tracks from Delerium and Sarah McLachlan". "Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout" contains corresponding remixes of the songs from these two artists. The album opens with the Slow Rise Mix of Delerium's previously unreleased song "You & I", which was described as "adult alternative" track with vocals comparable to Jon Anderson. The Solarstone Afterhours Mix of "World on Fire" by McLachlan appears as track number three, whereas the Alpha Mix of "Weekends" by The Perishers is the eighth track. The remix of "Weekends" was described as relaxing and the one true chill-out song on "Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout", with the lead vocalist sounding reminiscent of Peter Gabriel.

Bergstrom also pointed out the inclusion of songs from Nettwerk bands such as Ivy and Bent. The former band contributes "Nothing but the Sky" to the compilation, which is a pop song that is "pleasant and ethereal" and drew comparisons to the works of Lush. Bent's "Silent Life", the compilation's sixth track, combines "warm harmonies, woozy lap steel, and twinkling electronics for a Beatles-on-downers kind of bliss." Despite "Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout" containing songs mostly from the 2000s, it also features Talk Talk's 1986 single "Life's What You Make It".

"Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout" divided music critics. David Jeffries, an editor for AllMusic, referred to the album as a well-chosen mix of chill-out songs and awarded it three-and-a-half out of four stars. He pointed out the diversity of the track listing, writing: "But where Nettwerk always succeeds and surprises with their "Chillout" series is with the lesser knowns. The collection would be less desirable without the lazy indie rock of the Perishers, the trippy sexiness of Holden & Thompson, and the otherworldly experimentalism of Ulrich Schnauss." Jeffries concluded that because the album is "able to juggle such diverse styles while remaining smooth and hip, it's easy to recommend." Bergstrom from "PopMatters" was disappointed by the collection, ultimately giving it a 3 out of 10 rating. The magazine's critical consensus read: "It's tough to chill out at 90 beats-per-minute, and the baffling song selection doesn't help. The latest in this usually reliable series should've been called 'Indie Darlings 101'." Bergstrom also considered this installment a new low for the "Chillout" series, citing that chill-out music is supposed to be "dreamy, mellow, moody, slow, drifty, and, often, instrumental", but "Chillout 06/The Ultimate Chillout" "rarely meets any of these criteria" and is rather a collection of indie music.

Nuts (soundtrack)

Nuts is the soundtrack album to the 1987 American film of the same name. It was released by Columbia Records on December 21, 1987, and features five instrumental compositions by American singer Barbra Streisand. "Nuts" is the singer's first release since her live album "One Voice", earlier in 1987, and her first soundtrack since "Yentl" (1983). She insisted on creating the film's score after acquiring the movie through her production company, Barwood Films.

The album contains four original songs written and produced by Streisand, in addition to "The Bar", which samples her collaboration with Richard Baskin titled "Here We Are at Last", originally included on her twenty-third studio album, "Emotion" (1984). Initial reviews for "Nuts" were negative, but Streisand claimed the criticism was on behalf of her role as a Renaissance woman, which she felt the world was not yet ready for. Modern reviews for the soundtrack were more positive.

The American drama film "Nuts" was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on November 20, 1987, to theaters in the United States. Its accompanying soundtrack was released as a LP, cassette, and CD on December 21 of the same year through Columbia Records. "Nuts" was Streisand's first physical release since her third live album, "One Voice", earlier in 1987, and her first soundtrack since "Yentl" (1983). The singer's production company, Barwood Films, acquired the production rights to "Nuts" in 1987, which enabled her to personally choose the film's score. At this same time, an outside writer had been commissioned to create music for "Nuts", but Streisand refused and decided to compose the film's score by herself instead. The soundtrack was recorded at Lorimar Studios in Culver City, California and serves as the singer's "first attempt at film-music composition".

"Nuts" contains five instrumental compositions written and produced by Streisand, with the exception of "The Bar", which includes additional writing from Richard Baskin. All of the songs were recorded throughout 1987, excluding "The Bar", which was initially recorded in June 1984. Dan Wallin and Bob Fernandez served as recording engineers to the soundtrack, whereas Jeremy Lubbock arranged and conducted the score's four original compositions and Randy Waldman solely arranged and played on "The Bar". "The End Credits", the album's closing track, was featured on Streisand's fifth compilation album and first box set, "Just for the Record...", in 1991. The version that appears on the record is titled "Theme" and is paired alongside Baskin's instrumental version of "The Bar", which contains an instrumental sample of Streisand's song "Here We Are at Last", taken from her twenty-third studio album, "Emotion" (1984).

Initial reviews for the film's soundtrack were mostly negative, with them targeting the singer's role as a composer. Acknowledging the album's poor reception, Streisand reacted: "I don't get angry. I get hurt. It's a strange phenomenon that our society is not ready for a Renaissance woman. It is only ready for a Renaissance man." Contemporary reviews leaned towards being more positive; due to its short length, author Allison J. Waldman described the soundtrack as a "minimalist score" and "mini-CD soundtrack" in her 2001 biographical book "The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook". Although she considered the score to be "subtle and slight," she concluded: "to [Streisand's] credit, it was an effective complement to the movie." Tom Santopietro, author of "The Importance of Being Barbra: The Brilliant, Tumultuous Career of Barbra Streisand", wrote that "Here We Are at Last" was originally meant for "Nuts" rather than "Emotion" and praised it, calling it the "only song [that] registers at all" with Streisand at this point in her career.

All tracks produced by Streisand. On the cassette release of "Nuts", "The Finale" and "The End Credits" are combined into one track, titled "The Finale / The End Credits", which has a duration of four minutes and 50 seconds.

<doc id="56640763" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56640763" title="Planetary Missions Program Office">
Planetary Missions Program Office

The Planetary Missions Program Office is a division of NASA headquartered at the Marshall Space Flight Center, formed by the agency's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). Succeeding the Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office, it was established in 2014 to manage the Discovery and New Frontiers programs of low and medium-cost missions by third-party institutions, and the Solar System Exploration program of NASA-led missions that focus on prioritized planetary science objectives. The Discovery and New Frontiers programs were established in 1992 and 2001 respectively, and have launched fourteen primary missions together, along with two missions launched under the administration of the Planetary Missions Program Office. The Solar System Exploration Program was established alongside the office, with three missions planned for launch under the new program.

The Planetary Missions Program Office was established in late 2014 as part of a series of changes implemented by NASA after the passage of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015, which allocated US$1.438 billion to planetary missions, and the Obama administration's request for the 2016 United States federal budget. The program office is a replacement for the Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office, established in 2004, and occupies their former headquarters at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The Planetary Missions Program Office took control of the Discovery and New Frontiers program, along with the Europa Mission and NASA contributions to the European Space Agency (ESA)'s "JUICE" mission, in a then-unnamed program outside of Discovery and New Frontiers. In 2017, the program was named the "Solar System Exploration Program", and grew to include NASA's surviving "DART" component of the cancelled "AIDA" mission, after ESA terminated their contribution to the mission in late 2016.

The Discovery program was established in late 1990 as a program of low-cost, limited-scope solar system exploration missions, succeeding the objectives of the Planetary Observer program. In the late 1980s, leaders at NASA opted towards expensive, more ambitious missions to advance their objectives. This included the Space Exploration Initiative by the George H. W. Bush administration, which laid out a plan to construct Space Station Freedom and establish a human exploration program to the Moon and Mars. Consistent cost overruns and lack of support from the United States Congress, however, created a trend towards smaller, less ambitious missions. NASA's Solar System Exploration Division (SSED) initially proposed to model a new program of small-class unmanned missions after the Planetary Observer program, though members were skeptical, due to the budget problems plaguing the Planetary Observer program at the time. It was decided instead to base it on the Explorer program, following advice from Explorer administrative staffer Tom Krimigis. Under this model, the program gained support from then-NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, and the program was formally approved by Congress in 1992.

Originally a Planetary Observer program mission, "NEAR Shoemaker" was reassigned to the Discovery program, after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory found that the mission was possible to execute on a budget smaller than originally planned. Its final mission cost would reach US$224 million. "Mars Pathfinder" was also reassigned to the program as part of cuts to the Space Exploration Initiative Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) program, following the loss of its flagship "Mars Observer". Both "NEAR Shoemaker" and "Mars Pathfinder" were successfully launched in February and December 1996 respectively; the former achieved orbit around the asteroid 433 Eros in February 2000, and the latter landed on Mars and delivered the first operational Mars rover, "Sojourner", to the surface of the planet in July 1997. After "NEAR Shoemaker" and "Mars Pathfinder", the Discovery program began selecting its future missions from proposals from third-party institutions, in competitions named "Announcements of Opportunity" (AOs). Twelve missions have been selected through AOs, with the latest, reconnaissance missions "Lucy" and "Psyche", selected in January 2017 after a three-year long competition. The Discovery program also presides over "Missions of Opportunity" (MOs) to develop instruments for non-NASA missions, such as the ASPERA-3 instrument instrument onboard ESA's "Mars Express" and the M instrument aboard ISRO's "Chandrayaan-1". MOs were originally selected in competitions alongside AOs, though have been selected in "Stand Alone Mission of Opportunity Notices" (SALMONs) since 2009. SALMON-3 is currently underway to select NASA's contribution to JAXA's "Martian Moons Exploration" mission.


The New Frontiers program is the successor to the cancelled Outer Planet/Solar Probe (OPSP) program, a project which aimed to launch the "Europa Orbiter" astrobiology mission, the "Pluto Kuiper Express" reconnaissance mission, and the "Solar Orbiter" heliophysics mission. To reduce the growing costs of the OPSP, the "Pluto Kuiper Express" was cancelled in 2000 by then-Science Mission Directorate Edward J. Weiler, who subsequently accepted proposals for a replacement mission and modelled the competition after the Discovery program's AOs. The "New Horizons" mission was chosen to replace "Pluto Kuiper Express" in the OPSP program in November 2001, though the entire program, including the "Europa Orbiter", "New Horizons", and "Solar Probe", was cancelled by Administrator of NASA Sean O'Keefe in February 2002, shortly after his appointment by President George W. Bush. O'Keefe cited a need for a restructuring of NASA and its projects, falling in line with the Bush Administration's wish for NASA to refocus on "research and development, and addressing management shortcomings."

The "New Horizons" team successfully lobbied for the funding and development of their mission, appearing at the top of the National Research Council's Planetary Science Decadal Survey for 2003–2013. Weiler and then-Solar System Exploration Division Director Colleen Hartman established the New Frontiers program in 2003 to help fund and launch "New Horizons" and future proposals from the Decadal Survey. "New Horizons" was launched as the program's first mission on January 20, 2006, and successfully performed the first reconnaissance of Pluto and its moons in July 2015. An extended mission is underway to observe Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), including a flyby of Ultima Thule in January 2019. In the first New Frontiers AO, "Juno", a mission to investigate the interior of Jupiter, was selected over the "MoonRise" lunar sample return mission. "Juno" launched on August 5, 2011, and arrived at Jupiter in July 2016. In May 2011, the "OSIRIS-REx" asteroid sample return mission was selected over "MoonRise" and "SAGE" for the program's third mission. "OSIRIS-REx" launched on September 8, 2016, and will arrive at the Near-Earth object (NEO) 101955 Bennu in August 2018. The AO for the program's fourth mission is currently underway, with "CAESAR" and "Dragonfly" selected as the competition's finalists.


In late 2014, the Solar System Exploration program was established alongside the Planetary Missions Program Office to "execute prioritized planetary science." The first planned mission of the program is "DART", an asteroid deflection test targeting 65803 Didymos scheduled to launch in 2020 or 2021. Originally a component of "AIDA", "DART"s impact was intended to be observed by ESA's "AIM" orbiter, which would continue to study Didymos from orbit. However, the ESA Council at ministerial level cancelled the "AIM" mission in favour of funding for the "ExoMars 2020" rover, citing budget concerns. Despite the cancellation of "AIM", NASA committed to their original plan, opting to continue solely with "DART". Two Europa astrobiology missions are scheduled in the Solar System Exploration program. The "Europa Clipper" is scheduled to launch in the early 2020s on the inaugural cargo flight of the Space Launch System. The ESA "JUICE" mission to study Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto will utilize the NASA-built, Solar System Exploration Program-funded Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) and parts of the Particle Environment Package (PEP) and Radar for Icy Moons Exploration (RIME) instruments.
